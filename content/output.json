    "paper_abstract": "The scrutiny and judgement faced by public figures is not unique to them. As you progress in your management career, you will find that senior positions invite more scrutiny from your colleagues. The visibility of those in power encourages scrutiny, and during good times, they can be fantastic role models. But during bad times, fingers will be pointed at them, despite the net result of the current situation being generated by the whole organization. Coping strategies for those in positions of power include compartmentalizing their personality into their \"work\" self and their \"home\" self, but it can become exhausting. Judgement can come from both directions, and to deal with it, one must be themselves, warts and all. ",

He highlights the common issue of wasted time between phases of work and how individual focus on productivity can cause total productivity of the group to suffer. Stanier suggests that a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI) can be useful in clarifying roles and responsibilities within a team, but emphasizes that ownership is primarily a change in mindset rather than a change in process. He warns against hiding behind definitions and processes, and encourages individuals to care about everything, as start-ups do.",
