    "title": "Fast-forwarding decision making",
    "paper_abstract": "The article discusses how organizations waste time in decision making by engaging in the theatre of decision making, which creates delay rather than progress. The author advises holding oneself accountable for making decisions and progressing discussions as quickly as possible by being creative about ways of shaving minutes, hours, and days from a decision point.",

    "title": "Scrutiny and Judgement",
    "paper_abstract": "The scrutiny and judgement faced by public figures is not unique to them. As you progress in your management career, you will find that senior positions invite more scrutiny from your colleagues. The visibility of those in power encourages scrutiny, and during good times, they can be fantastic role models. But during bad times, fingers will be pointed at them, despite the net result of the current situation being generated by the whole organization. Coping strategies for those in positions of power include compartmentalizing their personality into their \"work\" self and their \"home\" self, but it can become exhausting. Judgement can come from both directions, and to deal with it, one must be themselves, warts and all. ",

It explores the reasons why teams may be asked to work harder and the reasons why the stick approach may not work for software engineering teams. The article suggests that the stick approach is not effective for teams that are in an industry where demand for talent is high and where employees are self-motivated. ",
