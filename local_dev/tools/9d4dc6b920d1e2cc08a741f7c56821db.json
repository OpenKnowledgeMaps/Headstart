Its main objective is to design and develop a discovery platform for SSH, called GOTRIPLE. This deliverable is the main outcome of Task 6.1 which started at M4 at ends at M36, whose aim is to deal with the definition and the set-up of general TRIPLE's interoperability requirements, considering all the components which are composing the TRIPLE ecosystem (data, resources and tools). As preliminary results, we thus present here a general overview of the main EOSC interoperability requirements and specifications, both coming from a mapping of the EOSC Working Groups outputs, and of the most relevant results of EOSC related projects related to TRIPLE. We also attempt to provide TRIPLE's answers, proposals and solutions to the above mentioned requirements. The final picture presents different levels of precision, which depends on the fluidity of the EOSC definition on the one hand, and on the consequent fact that some implications are still unclear, and a discussion on the measures to address EOSC requirements is still on-going. While tackling interoperability, we introduce TRIPLE in its context in order to locate the GOTRIPLE platform in the EOSC frame, and more specifically in the SSH cluster of the EOSC (section 1). Section 2 defines the general interoperability requirements, starting with the software (2.2) and then presents an analysis of the main outputs released by the EOSC Working groups (2.3), taking into consideration as a general reference, the EOSC Interoperability Framework, and, more specifically, the FAIR and Architecture WGs documents (2.3.2, 2.3.4). These are the main guiding references for the design and realization of the EOSC, considering specifically interoperability. Section 2.3.3 illustrates how TRIPLE is translating into practice the FAIR requirements, while section 2.3.5 is focused on TRIPLE current decisions regarding the integration of the TRIPLE solution into the EOSC. To present an enriched scenario, the section includes as well a brief overview of other relevant outputs released by the EOSC WGs (Landscape, RoP, Sustainability and Skills and Training) (2.3.6). With the aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the EOSC interoperability requirements, the WP6 partners have analyzed relevant deliverables produced by the main EOSC related projects as preparatory activity. The analysis was useful to understand the EOSC environment and its evolution in terms of interoperability and at the same time to understand which external deliverables have to be taken into consideration for the overall project development in TRIPLE. Section 3 includes a synthesis of this work, which is fully presented in Annex I. Section 4 - Conclusions and Outlook, outlines TRIPLE's the next steps to achieve interoperability and the strategies that will be adopted.\",\"doi\":\"\",\"project_id\":\"863420\",\"accessright\":\"Restricted\",\"authors\":\"Di Donato, Francesca; Lombardo, Tiziana; Breitfuss, Gert; Chen, Yin; Dumouchel, Suzanne; Eskevich, Maria; Gingold, Arnaud; Gorgaini, Elisa; Monachini, Monica; Moranville, Yoann; Ocansey, Joshua Tetteh; Thiel, Carsten; Tóth-Czifra, Erzsébet\",\"subject_orig\":\"EOSC\",\"oa_state\":0,\"url\":\"7f4151031b2611009b557a670eff6f\",\"cluster_labels\":\"EOSC catalogue, Triple deliverable d6, 2020 eosc-related projects\",\"x\":\"0.362224943438186\",\"y\":\"0.422189736530404\",\"labels\":\"\",\"area_uri\":9,\"area\":\"EOSC catalogue, Triple deliverable d6, 2020 eosc-related projects\"}]"}
