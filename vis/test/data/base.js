We present a sociocritical approach to digital technology in education, one that can provide a theoretical backdrop relevant to the consideration of (in)equity issues. Our starting point is the observation that the most usual approaches to the study of digital technology in education have been instrumentalist or deterministic. Such approaches tend to gloss over certain issues of integration of digital technology in education, including those pertaining to digital (in)equity.
