Despite the formidable potential of aryl methyl ethers as coupling partners, the scarcity of metal-catalyzed C–heteroatom bond formations via C–OMe cleavage is striking, with isolated precedents requiring specialized, yet expensive, ligands, high temperatures, and π-extended backbones. We report an unprecedented catalytic ipso-silylation of aryl methyl ethers under mild conditions and without recourse to external ligands. The method is distinguished by its wide scope, which includes the use of benzyl methyl ethers, vinyl methyl ethers, and unbiased anisole derivatives, thus representing a significant step forward for designing new C–heteroatom bond formations via C–OMe scission. Applications of this transformation in orthogonal silylation techniques as well as in further derivatizations are also described. Preliminary mechanistic experiments suggest the intermediacy of Ni(0)-ate complexes, leaving some doubt that a canonical catalytic cycle consisting of an initial oxidative addition of the C–OMe bond to Ni(0) species comes into play.","project_id":"277883","accessright":"Open Access","authors":"Zarate, Cayetana; Nakajima, Masaki; Martin, Ruben","oa_state":1,"url":"od_______272::f8c282c3bf9f8ec88cae7b14d56a8f15","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Ligand-free NiCatalyzed silylation","x":176.64611904371225,"y":98.88029338431043,"area_uri":3,"area":"Ligand-free NiCatalyzed silylation","cited_by_tweeters_count":"1","readers.mendeley":"13","citation_count":"15","file_hash":"hashHash","readers":13,"comments":[],"content_based":0,"authors_string":"Cayetana Zarate, Masaki Nakajima, Ruben Martin","authors_short_string":"C.

While originally visualized as exotic cross-coupling reactions, a close look into the literature data indicates that these processes have become a fertile ground, allowing for the utilization of a variety of coupling partners, even with particularly challenging substrate combinations. As for other related cross-electrophile scenarios, the vast majority of reductive carboxylation of organic (pseudo)halides are characterized by their simplicity, mild conditions, and a broad functional group compatibility, suggesting that these processes could be implemented in late-stage diversification. This perspective describes the evolution of metal-catalyzed reductive carboxylation of organic (pseudo)halides from its inception in the pioneering stoichiometric work of Osakada to the present. Specific emphasis is devoted to the reactivity of these coupling processes, with substrates ranging from aryl-, vinyl-, benzyl- to unactivated alkyl (pseudo)halides. Despite the impressive advances realized, a comprehensive study detailing the mechanistic intricacies of these processes is still lacking. Some recent empirical evidence reveal an intriguing dichotomy exerted by the substitution pattern on the ligands utilized; still, however, some elementary steps within the catalytic cycle of these reactions remain speculative, in many instances invoking a canonical cross-coupling process. Although tentative, we anticipate that these processes might fall into more than one distinct mechanistic category depending on the substrate utilized, suggesting that investigations aimed at unraveling the mechanistic underpinnings of these processes will likely bring new and innovative research grounds in this vibrant area of expertise.","project_id":"277883","accessright":"Open Access","authors":"Daniel Gallego","oa_state":1,"url":"dedup_wf_001::b1faf0c8cc13c9b8312be82ff2b47136","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Carbonyl type compounds, Carboxylation of organic, Catalyzed reductive coupling","x":-727.3744656887832,"y":130.1432480641113,"area_uri":9,"area":"Carbonyl type compounds, Carboxylation of organic, Catalyzed reductive coupling","cited_by_tweeters_count":"11","readers.mendeley":"100","citation_count":"176","file_hash":"hashHash","readers":100,"comments":[],"content_based":0,"authors_string":"Daniel Gallego","authors_short_string":"Daniel Gallego","safe_id":"dedup__005fwf__005f001__003a__003ab1faf0c8cc13c9b8312be82ff2b47136","subject_orig":"Perspective","num_readers":0,"internal_readers":1,"num_subentries":0,"tweets":11,"citations":176,"paper_selected":false,"oa":true,"free_access":false,"oa_link":"http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5057167","outlink":"https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=dedup_wf_001::b1faf0c8cc13c9b8312be82ff2b47136","comments_for_filtering":"","diameter":37.2,"width":27.684552760311327,"height":36.91273701374844,"orig_x":"-0.42064003","orig_y":"-0.26711911","resized":false},{"doi":"10.1021/acscatal.6b03205","id":"dedup_wf_001::a8dd7802baa799f421aef7d4207116b1","subject":"alkyl iodides; atom transfer; cyclization unactivated","title":"Visible-Light-Promoted Atom Transfer Radical Cyclization of Unactivated Alkyl Iodides","year":"2016-12-13","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","resulttype":"publication","language":"","published_in":"ACS Catalysis","link":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acscatal.6b03205","fulltext":"","paper_abstract":"A visible-light-mediated atom transfer radical cyclization of unactivated alkyl iodides is described.
