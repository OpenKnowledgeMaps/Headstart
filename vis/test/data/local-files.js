Lately, CSCL research focuses on the facilitation of specific processes of argumentative knowledge construction, e.g., with computer-supported collaboration scripts. In order to refine process-oriented instructional support, such as scripts, we need to measure the influence of scripts on specific processes of argumentative knowledge construction. In this article, we propose a multi-dimensional approach to analyze argumentative knowledge construction in CSCL from sampling and segmentation of the discourse corpora to the analysis of four process dimensions (participation, epistemic, argumentative, social mode).","published_in":"Computers & Education","year":"2006","url":"a-framework-to-analyze-argumentative-knowledge-construction-in-computersupported-collaborative-learning","file_hash":"978018f69b3e27b930a6de719bc8f285f2295793","authors":"Weinberger,A;Fischer,F;","oa_state":"0","comments":[],"subject_orig":"","authors_string":"A Weinberger, F Fischer","authors_short_string":"A.

The vast majority of the current literature in this new research area consists of case studies. Communities of practice have the following components that distinguish them from traditional organizations and learning situations: (1) different levels of expertise that are simultaneously present in the community of practice; (2) fluid peripheral to center movement that symbolizes the progression from being a novice to an expert; and (3) completely authentic tasks and communication. Supporting concepts include aspects of constructivism (i.e., ill-structured problems, facilitation, collaborative learning, and negotiated goals), community knowledge greater than individual knowledge, as well as an environment of safety and trust. Virtual communities are defined as designed communities using current networked technology, whereas communities of practice emerge within the designed community via the ways their participants use the designed community. Current networked technology has both advantages and disadvantages in emergent development of communities of practice. Because most collaboration is text-based, norms are reduced, enabling introverted participants to share their ideas on an equal footing with extroverts. However, the greatest problem with virtual communities is withdrawing, or attrition. This problem can be reduced somewhat through good facilitation techniques and adequate scaffolding, especially in the cases of online communication techniques and technical support. Finally, the author recommends further research questions and proposes a case study, whose purpose is to observe the effects of an emerging community of practice within the designed environment of a virtual community.","published_in":"The Internet and Higher Education","year":"2001","url":"a-survey-of-current-research-on-online-communities-of-practice","file_hash":"57f25a1f63055eaf4cc1348ab070d9a6574acc00","authors":"Johnson,C;","oa_state":"1","comments":[],"subject_orig":"","authors_string":"C Johnson","authors_short_string":"C.

This article articulates the pedagogical potential of augmented reality simulations in environmental engineering education by immersing students in the roles of scientists conducting investigations. This design experiment examined if augmented reality simulation games can be used to help students understand science as a social practice, whereby inquiry is a process of balancing and managing resources, combining multiple data sources, and forming and revising hypotheses in situ. We provide 4 case studies of secondary environmental science students participating in the program. Positioning students in virtual investigations made apparent their beliefs about science and confronted simplistic beliefs about the nature of science. Playing the game in 'real' space also triggered students' preexisting knowledge, suggesting that a powerful potential of augmented reality simulation games can be in their ability to connect academic content and practices with students' physical, lived worlds. The game structure provided students a narrative to think with, although students differed in their ability to create a coherent narrative of events. We argue that Environmental Detectives is 1 model for helping students understand the socially situated nature of scientific practice.","published_in":"The Journal of the Learning Sciences","year":"2007","url":"augmented-reality-simulations-on-handheld-computers","file_hash":"a4f308580a53de5aff759f67943b435fb217a038","authors":"Squire,Kurt;Klopfer,Eric;","oa_state":"1","comments":[],"subject_orig":"","authors_string":"Kurt Squire, Eric Klopfer","authors_short_string":"K.

The primary unit of analysis of this process is neither the individual nor social institutions, but the informal 'communities of practice' that people form as they pursue shared enterprises over time. To give a social account of learning, the theory explores in a systematic way the intersection of issues of community, social practice, meaning, and identity. The result is a broad framework for thinking about learning as a process of social participation. This ambitious but thoroughly accessible framework has relevance for the practitioner as well as the theoretician, presented with all the breadth, depth, and rigor necessary to address such a complex and yet profoundly human topic.","published_in":"Learning in doing","year":"1998","url":"communities-practice-learning-meaning-identity-19","file_hash":"8e0bd9debb0836aa5d77f18d19d893181edf21a5","authors":"Wenger,Etienne;","oa_state":"1","comments":[],"subject_orig":"","authors_string":"Etienne Wenger","authors_short_string":"E.

As we will see in this essay, such a simple statement conceals considerable complexity. The interplay of learning with technology turns out to be quite intricate. The inclusion of collaboration, computer mediation and distance education has problematized the very notion of learning and called into question prevailing assumptions about how to study it. Like many active fields of scientific research, CSCL has a complex relationship to established disciplines, evolves in ways that are hard to pinpoint and includes important contributions that seem incompatible. The field of CSCL has a long history of controversy about its theory, methods and definition. Furthermore, it is important to view CSCL as a vision of what may be possible with computers and of what kinds of research should be conducted, rather than as an established body of broadly accepted laboratory and classroom practices. We will start from some popular understandings of the issues of CSCL and gradually reveal its more complex nature.

Expressions producing new creative forms,such as digital sampling,skinning and modding,fan videomaking,fan fiction writing,zines,mash-ups). Collaborative Problem-solving working together in teams,formal and informal, to complete tasks and develop new knowledge (such as through Wikipedia,alternative reality gaming,spoiling). Circulations Shaping the flow of media (such as podcasting,blogging). A growing body of scholarship suggests potential benefits of these forms of participatory cul- ture,including opportunities for peer-to-peer learning,a changed attitude toward intellectual property,the diversification of cultural expression,the development of skills valued in the mod- ern workplace,and a more empowered conception of citizenship. Access to this participatory culture functions as a new form of the hidden curriculum,shaping which youth will succeed and which will be left behind as they enter school and the workplace. Some have argued that children and youth acquire these key skills and competencies on their own by interacting with popular culture.Three concerns,however,suggest the need for policy and pedagogical interventions: The Participation Gap the unequal access to the knowledge that will prepare youth for full participation in the world of tomorrow. The Transparency Problem The challenges young people face in learning to see clearly the ways that media shape perceptions of the world. The Ethics Challenge The breakdown of traditional forms of professional training and socialization that might prepare young people for their increasingly public roles as media makers and community participants.","published_in":"Program","year":"2009","url":"confronting-the-challenges-of-participatory-culture-media-education-for-the-21st-century-2","file_hash":"c82d964c7724a7cf9c6eed112d64e4cd0fb4ec2a","authors":"Jenkins,Henry;","oa_state":"1","comments":[],"subject_orig":"","authors_string":"Henry Jenkins","authors_short_string":"H.

Learning sciences researchers investigate cognition in context, at times emphasizing one more than the other but with the broad goal of developing evidence-based claims derived from both laboratory-based and naturalistic investigations that result in knowledge about how people learn. This work can involve the development of technological tools, curriculum, and especially theory that can be used to understand and support learning. A fundamental assumption of many learning scientists is that cognition is not a thing located within the individual thinker but is a process that is distributed across the knower, the environment in which knowing occurs, and the activity in which the learner participates. In other words, learning, cognition, knowing, and context are irreducibly co-constituted and cannot be treated as isolated entities or processes. If one believes that context matters in terms of learning and cognition, research paradigms that simply examine these processes as isolated variables within laboratory or other impoverished contexts of participation will necessarily lead to an incomplete understanding of their relevance in more naturalistic settings (Brown, 1992).1 Alternatively, simply observing learning and cognition as they naturally THE JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, 13(1), 114 Copyright 2004, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Education is an applied field, and learning scientists bring agendas to their work, seeking to produce specific results such as engaging students in the making of science, creating online communities for professional development, or creating history classrooms that confront students preexisting beliefs about race, gender, or class. As such, learning scientists have found that they must develop technological tools, curriculum, and especially theories that help them systematically understand and predict how learning occurs. Such design research offers several benefits: research results that consider the role of social context and have better potential for influencing educational practice, tangible products, and programs that can be adopted elsewhere; and research results that are validated through the consequences of their use, providing consequential evidence or validity (Messick, 1992). However, participating in local educational practices places researchers in the role of curriculum designers, and implicitly, curriculum theorists who are directly positioned in social and political contexts of educational practice (both global and local) and who are accountable for the social and political consequences of their research programs. Increasingly, learning scientists are finding themselves developing contexts, frameworks, tools and pedagogical models consistent with and to better understand emerging pedagogical theories or ontological commitments (see diSessa & Cobb, this issue). In these contexts, the research moves beyond simply observing and actually involves systematically engineering these contexts in ways that allow us to improve and generate evidence-based claims about learning. The commitment to examining learning in naturalistic contexts, many of which are designed and systematically changed by the researcher, necessitates the development of a methodological toolkit for deriving evidence-based claims from these contexts. One such methodology that has grown in application is that of design experimentation or design-based research, frequently traced back to the work of Ann Brown (1992) and Alan Collins (1992). Design-based research is not so much an approach as it is a series of approaches, with the intent of producing new theories, artifacts, and practices that account for and potentially impact learning and teaching in naturalistic settings. Cobb, diSessa, Lehrer, & Schauble (2003) stated: Prototypically, design experiments entail both engineering particular forms of learning and systematically studying those forms of learning within the context defined by the means of supporting them. This designed context is subject to test and revision, and the successive iterations that result play a role similar to that of systematic variation in experiment. (p. 9) They further suggested that design-based research has a number of common features, including the fact that they result in the production of theories on learning and teaching, are interventionist (involving some sort of design), take place in naturalistic contexts, and are iterative. Design-based research is not simply a type of formative evaluation that allows learning scientists to better understand the ecological validity of theoretical claims generated in the laboratory. Design-based research, as conceived by Ann Brown (1992), was introduced with the expectation that researchers would systemically adjust various aspects of the designed context so that each adjustment served as a type of experimentation that allowed the researchers to test and generate theory in naturalistic contexts. Although design-based research has the potential to offer a useful methodological toolkit to those researchers committed to understanding variables within naturalistic contexts, there are many unresolved questions that we as a community must address if our assertions are going to be deemed credible and trustworthy to others. Some questions are: What are the core foci of design-based research and what delineates it from other forms of research? What counts as reasonable and useful warrants for advancing assertions investigated through this type of research? What are the boundaries of a naturalistic context? How do we control researcher bias in selecting evidence, in reporting observations, and in developing trustworthy claims? How do we understand the contextuality of reserach claims generated in situ and use them to inform broader practice? In the following, we begin the process of responding to these questions, a process that is taken up in greater detail through the core articles and commentaries that comprise this special issue and that we hope will be taken up over the next decade by our colleagues.","published_in":"The Journal of the Learning Sciences","year":"2004","url":"designbased-research-putting-a-stake-in-the-ground","file_hash":"4f0e6e7d48a2c4f0586b2d33cff7f3c3099a1cec","authors":"Barab,Sasha;Squire,Kurt;","oa_state":"0","comments":[],"subject_orig":"","authors_string":"Sasha Barab, Kurt Squire","authors_short_string":"S.

This paper aims to offer such a rationale, within a framework which can also unify the diverse set of practices which have been described as formative. The analysis is used to relate formative assessment both to other pedagogic initiatives, notably cognitive acceleration and dynamic assessment, and to some of the existing literature on models of self-regulated learning and on classroom discourse. This framework should indicate potentially fruitful lines for further enquiry, whilst at the same time opening up new ways of helping teachers to implement formative practices more effectively.","published_in":"Educational Assessment Evaluation and Accountability","year":"2005","url":"developing-the-theory-of-formative-assessment","file_hash":"df737d010bf4bde2f4ec5404119dbb3c4594dbe9","authors":"Black,Paul;Wiliam,Dylan;","oa_state":"1","comments":[],"subject_orig":"","authors_string":"Paul Black, Dylan Wiliam","authors_short_string":"P.
