However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV–host interactome and drug targets in the human protein–protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV–host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) c aptured by the “Complementary Exposure” pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV–host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.","published_in":"Cell Discovery","year":"2020-03-16","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-020-0153-3","readers":0,"subject_orig":"Drug repurposing, computational modeling and prediction","subject":"Drug repurposing, computational modeling and prediction","oa_state":1,"link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0153-3.pdf?origin=ppub","relevance":7,"comments":[{"comment":"A thoughful study identifying 16 drug combinations","author":"ReFigure Team"}],"tags":",","resulttype":"Journal Article","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Drug repurposing, Drug interaction, Interaction Checker","x":-474.7881599955948,"y":177.20097378404395,"area_uri":3,"area":"Therapeutics","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Yadi Zhou, Yuan Hou, Jiayu Shen, Yin Huang, William Martin, Feixiong Cheng","authors_short_string":"Y.

On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19.

As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.","published_in":"International Journal of Health Geographics","year":"2020-03-11","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00202-8","readers":0,"subject_orig":"Tracking technologies, GIS, geographic","subject":"Tracking technologies, GIS, geographic","oa_state":1,"link":"https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12942-020-00202-8","relevance":9,"comments":[],"tags":"Peer-reviewed","resulttype":"Review","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Chain reaction, Clinical presentations, Coronavirus 2019-ncov","x":435.76847848985966,"y":576.1405833198323,"area_uri":4,"area":"Epidemiology","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Maged N.

Traditional pathogen screening tests have a limited detection range and provide little additional information. We used total RNA sequencing (“meta-transcriptomics”) to reveal the full spectrum of microbes associated with paediatric ARI. Throat swabs were collected from 48 paediatric ARI patients and 7 healthy controls. Samples were subjected to meta-transcriptomics to determine the presence and abundance of viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens, and to reveal mixed infections, pathogen genotypes/subtypes, evolutionary origins, epidemiological history, and antimicrobial resistance. We identified 11 RNA viruses, 4 DNA viruses, 4 species of bacteria, and 1 fungus. While most are known to cause ARIs, others, such as echovirus 6, are rarely associated with respiratory disease. Co-infection of viruses and bacteria and of multiple viruses were commonplace (9/48), with one patient harboring 5 different pathogens, and genome sequence data revealed large intra-species diversity.

This study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea. We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment. The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease. Based on the results, we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics.","published_in":"Scientific Reports","year":"2020-03-09","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61133-9","readers":0,"subject_orig":"South Korea, Mers, incidence, spread","subject":"South Korea, Mers, incidence, spread","oa_state":1,"link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61133-9.pdf","relevance":13,"comments":[],"tags":"Peer-reviewed","resulttype":"Journal Article","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Chain reaction, Clinical presentations, Coronavirus 2019-ncov","x":620.5243748961177,"y":674.6778425980848,"area_uri":4,"area":"Epidemiology","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Chang Hoon Yang, Hyejin Jung","authors_short_string":"C.

Here we discuss five cellular processes, namely “autophagy”, “programmed cell death”, “immune response”, “cell cycle alteration”, and “lipid metabolic reprogramming”, that considerably guide viral replication after host infection in an orchestrated manner. On viral infection, “autophagy” and “programmed cell death” are two dynamically synchronized cell survival programs; “immune response” is a cell defense program typically suppressed by viruses; “cell cycle alteration” and “lipid metabolic reprogramming” are two altered cell housekeeping programs tunable in both directions. We emphasize on their functionalities in modulating viral replication, strategies viruses have evolved to tune these processes for their benefit, and how these processes orchestrate and govern cell fate upon viral infection. Understanding how viruses hijack host networks has both academic and industrial values in providing insights toward therapeutic strategy design for viral disease control, offering useful information in applications that aim to use viral vectors to improve human health such as gene therapy, and providing guidelines to maximize viral particle yield for improved vaccine production at a reduced cost.","published_in":"Virulence","year":"2020-02-16","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2020.1726594","readers":0,"subject_orig":"GO Terms, omics","subject":"GO Terms, omics","oa_state":1,"link":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21505594.2020.1726594?needAccess=true","relevance":16,"comments":[],"tags":"Peer-reviewed","resulttype":"Review","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Antibody-dependent enhancement, Coronavirus entry, Spike protein","x":175.47895429381947,"y":139.6616272325476,"area_uri":2,"area":"Host biology and clinical findings","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Xiaofeng Dai, Olivier Hakizimana, Xuanhao Zhang, Aman Chandra Kaushik, Jianying Zhang","authors_short_string":"X.

We have focused on identifying repurposing candidates for the transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2), which is critical for entry of coronaviruses into cells. Using known 3D structures of close homologs, we created seven homology models. We also identified a set of serine protease inhibitor drugs, generated several conformations of each, and docked them into our models. We used three known chemical (non-drug) inhibitors and one validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 in MERS as benchmark compounds and found six compounds with predicted high binding affinity in the range of the known inhibitors. We also showed that a previously published weak inhibitor, Camostat, had a significantly lower binding score than our six compounds. All six compounds are anticoagulants with significant and potentially dangerous clinical effects and side effects. Nonetheless, if these compounds significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, they could represent a potentially useful clinical tool.","published_in":"ChemRxiv","year":"2020-03-20","url":"https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.12009582","readers":0,"subject_orig":"structural modeling, computational modeling","subject":"structural modeling, computational modeling","oa_state":1,"link":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/itempdf74155353254prod/12009582/Homology_Modeling_of_TMPRSS2_Yields_Candidate_Drugs_That_May_Inhibit_Entry_of_SARS-CoV-2_into_Human_Cells_v1.pdf","relevance":17,"comments":[],"tags":"Peer-reviewed","resulttype":"Preprint","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Antibody-dependent enhancement, Coronavirus entry, Spike protein","x":247.95990194528883,"y":95.00075386275259,"area_uri":3,"area":"Therapeutics","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Stefano Rensi, Russ B Altman, Tianyun Liu, Yu-Chen Lo, Greg McInnes, Alex Derry, Allison Keys","authors_short_string":"S.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012, causing lethal respiratory disease in approximately 35% of human cases. Primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection are needed to support development of therapeutics or vaccines, but few models exist that recapitulate severe disease signs. For initial development of a MERS-CoV primate model, twelve African green monkeys (AGMs) were exposed to 103, 104, or 105 PFU target doses of aerosolized MERS-CoV. We observed a dose-dependent increase of respiratory disease signs and viral titers in serum and throat swabs between the 103 PFU and the 105 PFU dose groups, although all AGMs survived for the 28 day duration of the study. This study is the first to describe dose-dependent effects of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection of primates and uses a route of infection (small particle aerosol) with potential relevance to MERS-CoV transmission in humans. Aerosol exposure of AGMs may provide a platform for the development of primate models of novel coronavirus disease, with potential utility in therapeutic development and viral pathogenesis studies.","published_in":"Research Square","year":"2020-03-19","url":"https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-17952/v1","readers":0,"subject_orig":"coronavirus, CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS, MERS-CoV, primate model, African green monkey, respiratory, aerosol, infectious disease, animal model, medical countermeasure, small particle aerosol","subject":"coronavirus, CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS, MERS-CoV, primate model, African green monkey, respiratory, aerosol, infectious disease, animal model, medical countermeasure, small particle aerosol","oa_state":1,"link":"https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-17952/v1/manuscript.pdf","relevance":19,"comments":[],"tags":"Peer-reviewed","resulttype":"Preprint","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Antibody-dependent enhancement, Coronavirus entry, Spike protein","x":513.1472553960173,"y":399.8800181809991,"area_uri":2,"area":"Host biology and clinical findings","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Allison Totura, Virginia Livingston, Ondraya Frick, David Dyer, Donald Nichols, Aysegul Nalca","authors_short_string":"A.

Among those with the greatest potential for such an event include influenza viruses and coronaviruses. In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.","published_in":"BoioRxiv","year":"2020-03-24","url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.004655","readers":0,"subject_orig":"COVID-19, transcriptomics, in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo","subject":"COVID-19, transcriptomics, in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo","oa_state":1,"link":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.004655v1.full.pdf","relevance":21,"comments":[],"tags":"","resulttype":"Preprint","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Antibody tests, Cell infection, Covid19 infection","x":197.98100687586228,"y":299.2185472002852,"area_uri":2,"area":"Host biology and clinical findings","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Daniel Blanco-Melo, Benjamin Nilsson-Payant, Wen-Chun Liu, Rasmus Moeller, Maryline Panis, David Sachs, Randy Albrecht, Benjamin R. tenOever","authors_short_string":"D.

However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of “relapse” or “reinfection”. The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.","published_in":"BioRxiv","year":"2020-03-14","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1","readers":0,"subject_orig":"rhesus macaque, immune memory, COVID-19","subject":"rhesus macaque, immune memory, COVID-19","oa_state":1,"link":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/14/2020.03.13.990226.full.pdf","relevance":22,"comments":[],"tags":"","resulttype":"Preprint","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Acute respiratory syndrome, Clinical characteristics, Cohort study","x":113.54964915053579,"y":436.14450501728203,"area_uri":5,"area":"Immunity","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Linlin Bao, Wei Deng, Hong Gao, Chong Xiao, Jiayi Liu, Jing Xue, Qi Lv, Jiangning Liu, Pin Yu, Yanfeng Xu, Feifei Qi, Yajin Qu, Fengdi Li, Zhiguang Xiang, Haisheng Yu, Shuran Gong, Mingya Liu, Guanpeng Wang, Shunyi Wang, Zhiqi Song, Wenjie Zhao, Yunlin Han, Linna Zhao, Xing Liu, Qiang Wei, Chuan Qin","authors_short_string":"L.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23–24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).Findings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47–2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304–130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8–7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227–805), 113 (57–193), 98 (49–168), 111 (56–191), and 80 (40–139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1–2 weeks. Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally","published_in":"The Lancet","year":"2020-01-31","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9","readers":0,"subject_orig":"Forecast","subject":"Forecast","oa_state":3,"link":"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930260-9","relevance":23,"comments":[],"tags":"Peer-reviewed","resulttype":"dataset","lang_detected":"english","cluster_labels":"Chain reaction, Clinical presentations, Coronavirus 2019-ncov","x":524.1610202951634,"y":706.5070115422658,"area_uri":4,"area":"Epidemiology","file_hash":"hashHash","authors_string":"Joseph T Wu, Kath Leung, Gabriel M Leung","authors_short_string":"J.
