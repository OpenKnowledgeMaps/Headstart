          We use text similarity to create a knowledge map. The algorithm groups
          those documents together that have many words in common. Area titles
          are created from subject keywords of documents that have been assigned
          to the same area. We select those keywords and phrases that appear
          frequently in one area, and seldom in other areas.

          Knowledge maps provide an instant overview of a topic by showing the
          main areas at a glance, and documents related to them. This makes it
          possible to easily identify useful, pertinent information.
