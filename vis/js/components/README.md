# Components
React components. See https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

Each component should be stored in a separate file.

Each component should have the same name as the file it is contained in.

Each file should export both the plain component and have the redux connected
component exported as the default. See: https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect
