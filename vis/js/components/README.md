# Components

React components. See https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

Each component should be stored in a separate file.

Each component should have the same name as the file it is contained in.

All components in this directory should be **container components**: that means
that each file should have the redux connected component exported as the
default. See: https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react#presentational-and-container-components

Presentational components are stored in the `templates/` directory.
