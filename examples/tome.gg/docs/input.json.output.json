The author applies this concept to engineering management, arguing that focusing on things outside of our control, such as the behavior of others, can lead to frustration and anxiety. Instead, managers should focus on the things that are within their control, such as their own behavior and actions, and seek to influence the things that are partially under their control. By doing so, managers can reduce stress and be more effective in their roles. The article offers practical tips for applying the Trichotomy of Control to engineering management, such as reframing problems in terms of what is and is not under our control, and focusing on the process rather than the outcome.\",\"published_in\":\"2018-09-27\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject\":\"Engineering management, administration\",\"authors\":\"Stanier, James\",\"link\":\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/the-trichotomy-of-control/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/the-trichotomy-of-control/\",\"relevance\":118,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"management\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"management\"}]"
