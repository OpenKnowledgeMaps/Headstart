The author applies this concept to engineering management, arguing that focusing on things outside of our control, such as the behavior of others, can lead to frustration and anxiety. Instead, managers should focus on the things that are within their control, such as their own behavior and actions, and seek to influence the things that are partially under their control. By doing so, managers can reduce stress and be more effective in their roles. The article offers practical tips for applying the Trichotomy of Control to engineering management, such as reframing problems in terms of what is and is not under our control, and focusing on the process rather than the outcome.",

Rockstars are motivated by being consistent, focused experts, while superstars thrive on new opportunities and variety in their work. Superstars may find stagnation frustrating, while rockstars may become frustrated by changes in circumstances. It is important to understand what motivates each type of performer to ensure they are happy and fulfilled in their roles and to place them in projects and teams where they will perform their best.",

The author uses the metaphor of a jelly mold to illustrate how organizations can 'wobble' under the weight of unstructured and emotional input, particularly at higher levels of the organization. The post provides guidance for managers on how to prevent this wobble by practicing emotional intelligence, judgment, and support when difficult situations arise. The author emphasizes the importance of mindful listening and observation, digesting information before communicating it to your team, reframing messages to focus on the positive, and building a peer support network.",

      "paper_abstract": "The scrutiny and judgement faced by public figures is not unique to them. As you progress in your management career, you will find that senior positions invite more scrutiny from your colleagues. The visibility of those in power encourages scrutiny, and during good times, they can be fantastic role models. But during bad times, fingers will be pointed at them, despite the net result of the current situation being generated by the whole organization. Coping strategies for those in positions of power include compartmentalizing their personality into their \"work\" self and their \"home\" self, but it can become exhausting. Judgement can come from both directions, and to deal with it, one must be themselves, warts and all. ",
