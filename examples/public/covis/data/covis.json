Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery.

The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths.

Understanding how viruses hijack host networks has both academic and industrial values in providing insights toward therapeutic strategy design for viral disease control, offering useful information in applications that aim to use viral vectors to improve human health such as gene therapy, and providing guidelines to maximize viral particle yield for improved vaccine production at a reduced cost.\",\"published_in\":\"Virulence\",\"year\":\"2020-02-16\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/21505594.2020.1726594\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"GO Terms, omics\",\"subject\":\"GO Terms, omics\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.tandfonline.com\\/doi\\/abs\\/10.1080\\/21505594.2020.1726594?needAccess=true\",\"relevance\":16,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"Peer-reviewed\",\"resulttype\":\"Review\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Antibody-dependent enhancement, Spike protein\",\"x\":\"0.127112210408477\",\"y\":\"-0.296072871346193\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Host biology and clinical findings\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.26434\\/chemrxiv.12009582\",\"title\":\"Homology Modeling of TMPRSS2 Yields Candidate Drugs That May Inhibit Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into Human Cells\",\"authors\":\"Rensi, Stefano; Altman, Russ B; Liu, Tianyun; Lo, Yu-Chen; McInnes, Greg; Derry, Alex; Keys, Allison\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The most rapid path to discovering treatment options for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is to find existing medications that are active against the virus.

We used three known chemical (non-drug) inhibitors and one validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 in MERS as benchmark compounds and found six compounds with predicted high binding affinity in the range of the known inhibitors. We also showed that a previously published weak inhibitor, Camostat, had a significantly lower binding score than our six compounds.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23\\u201324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI).Findings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2\\u00b768 (95% CrI 2\\u00b747\\u20132\\u00b786) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304\\u2013130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6\\u00b74 days (95% CrI 5\\u00b78\\u20137\\u00b71). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227\\u2013805), 113 (57\\u2013193), 98 (49\\u2013168), 111 (56\\u2013191), and 80 (40\\u2013139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1\\u20132 weeks. Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions.

This window of opportunity is correlated, interestingly, with an increase in IP-10\\/CXCL10 chemokine, which is known for its ability to recruit virus-specific antigen-experienced T cells (in so called push-pull immunity). In the second figure, we see historical data on bacterial superinfection over flu seasons going back to 1890. Interestingly, while anecdotal reports indicate bacterial superinfection might be important in coronavirus, a few reports indicate SARS virus does not elicit type I interferon in human cells. Also, along these lines, we see a representative lung CT of a patient with the viral pneumonia often reported in patients with COVID-19 that included ground-glass opacities (GGO, indicated by arrows), described as a type of interstitial pneumonia. Due to the nature of the crises, data is being published and updated almost daily. It is unclear what percentage of patients succumb to the interstitial pneumonia and which succumb to opportunistic bacterial superinfection. At the same time, there are reports of patients being treated with antibiotics, presumably to prevent opportunistic bacterial infection.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of ACE2 receptors throughout the human body including the brain. Figures 2 & 3 showed that SARS-CoV infection spread after it entered the nasal cavity in the mice model.

Initial outbreaks in China involved 13.8% cases with severe, and 6.1% with critical courses3. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 20035. However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission6\\u20138. There is an urgent need for information on body site-specific virus replication, immunity, and infectivity. Here we provide a detailed virological analysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 \\u00d7 108 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50% of patients (14 days in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.

Standard small molecule drug discovery workflows that start with library screens are an impractical path forward given the timelines to discover, develop, and test clinically. To accelerate the time to patient testing, here we explored the therapeutic potential of small molecule drugs that have been tested to some degree in a clinical environment, including approved medications, as possible therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. Motivating our process is a concept termed polypharmacology, i.e. off-target interactions that may hold therapeutic potential. In this work, we used Ligand Design, our deep learning drug design platform, to interrogate the polypharmacological profiles of an internal collection of small molecule drugs with federal approval or going through clinical trials, with the goal of identifying molecules predicted to modulate targets relevant for COVID-19 treatment. Resulting from our efforts is PolypharmDB, a resource of drugs and their predicted binding of protein targets across the human proteome. Mining PolypharmDB yielded molecules predicted to interact with human and viral drug targets for COVID-19, including host proteins linked to viral entry and proliferation and key viral proteins associated with the virus life-cycle. Further, we assembled a collection of prioritized approved drugs for two specific host-targets, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin B, whose joint inhibition was recently shown to block SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into host cells. Overall, we demonstrate that our approach facilitates rapid response, identifying 30 prioritized candidates for testing for their possible use as anti-COVID drugs. Using the PolypharmDB resource, it is possible to identify repurposed drug candidates for newly discovered targets within a single work day.

Previous studies indicated that specific Abs to SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) waned over time in recovered SARS patients. It is critical to find out whether a potential anamnestic response, as seen with other viral infections, exists to protect a person from reinfection in case of another SARS outbreak. Recovered SARS patients were followed up to 6 y to estimate the longevity of specific Ab. The specific memory B cell and T cell responses to SARS-CoV Ags were measured by means of ELISPOT assay. Factors in relation to humoral and cellular immunity were investigated. Six years postinfection, specific IgG Ab to SARS-CoV became undetectable in 21 of the 23 former patients. No SARS-CoV Ag-specific memory B cell response was detected in either 23 former SARS patients or 22 close contacts of SARS patients. Memory T cell responses to a pool of SARS-CoV S peptides were identified in 14 of 23 (60.9%) recovered SARS patients, whereas there was no such specific response in either close contacts or healthy controls. Patients with more severe clinical manifestations seemed to present a higher level of Ag-specific memory T cell response. SARS-specific IgG Ab may eventually vanish and peripheral memory B cell responses are undetectable in recovered SARS patients. In contrast, specific T cell anamnestic responses can be maintained for at least 6 y. These findings have applications in preparation for the possible reemergence of SARS.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease that caused a global epidemic in 2003. Clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, radiological presentations, and outcomes of SARS patients have been well described (1\\u20133). Six years after the SARS outbreak, an important question has received wide attention: will patients recovering from SARS present a protective response against reinfection in case of another SARS epidemic? Previous studies indicated that specific Abs to SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) waned over time. (4\\u20139) However, disappearance of anti\\u2013SARS-CoV Abs does not necessarily indicate loss of protection. As is well known, an efficient line of defense against viral reinfection consists of three key components: preexisting Abs, memory B cells, and memory T cells. Humoral memory (i.e., secretion of specific protective Abs over long periods in the apparent absence of the Ag) provides the host with a first line of defense against reinfection, constituting protection against a range of pathogens (10). For SARS-CoV infection, however, only a limited duration and limited level of humoral response could be elicited after natural infection (4, 5). In the absence of another SARS outbreak, we cannot deduce whether lower or even undetectable levels of specific Abs would be adequate to protect a person from reinfection by a potential anamnestic response. As seen with other viral infections such as measles and hepatitis A, memory B cells play an essential role in driving the rapid anamnestic Ab response that occurs after reexposure to Ag, even after levels of circulating Abs disappear, which can either completely prevent disease or greatly alleviate the severity of clinical manifestation (10). Human memory B cell response was supposed to be long-lived, but different viral infections lead to variety in the longevity of memory cells. Specific memory B cell response to variola virus could last for >50 y in immunized individuals (11). Patients surviving smallpox were thought to obtain life-long protection against reinfection (12, 13). It is unclear whether a potential anamnestic B cell response exists to protect a person from reinfection after reexposure to SARS-CoV. Of course, T cell responses are known to play their roles in protection against many viral infections and in supporting an anamnestic Ab response, because the anamnestic response of B cells depends on Ag-specific memory CD4+ T cells for rapid reactivation and differentiation into Ab-secreting cells (14). Cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV were confirmed in both SARS patients and experimental animals (15, 16), Memory T cell responses were detected in patients recovering from SARS 1, 2, and even 4 y later, although with a clear decline over time (17\\u201319). Whether the memory T cell response will be maintained at a detectable level thereafter remains to be investigated. The objectives of this study were to estimate the longevity of specific Ab against SARS-CoV, to measure the memory B cell and T cell responses in patients recovering from SARS, and to identify the factors possibly correlated with the specific immune responses.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Immunology\",\"year\":\"2011-06-15\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.jimmunol.org\\/content\\/186\\/12\\/7264.long\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"Memory B cell, antibodies, SARS-COV1, patient\",\"subject\":\"Memory B cell, antibodies, SARS-COV1, patient\",\"oa_state\":3,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.jimmunol.org\\/content\\/jimmunol\\/186\\/12\\/7264.full.pdf\",\"relevance\":40,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"Peer-reviewed\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Cell epitopes\",\"x\":\"-0.0615589973273506\",\"y\":\"-0.184668987283095\",\"area_uri\":5,\"area\":\"Immunity\"},{\"id\":\"http:\\/\\/cosmos.wisc.edu\\/sets\\/covid\",\"title\":\"Cosmos: Coronavirus database\",\"authors\":\"Please refer to website\",\"paper_abstract\":\"COSMOS is an AI assistant that extracts and assimilates data from heterogeneous sources to accelerate analytics and knowledge discovery.

In this study, we investigated how a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spike, mediates viral entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that MAb binds to the virus surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, MAb binds to cell surface IgG Fc receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. Our data suggest that the antibody\\/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized MAb dosages in viral-receptor-dependent, Fc-receptor-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent viral entry pathways, delineating guidelines on MAb usages in treating viral infections.

Their epidemiologies and clinical characteristics are poorly described and are often reliant on case reports. To address these problems, we conducted a large-scale comprehensive screening for all four coronaviruses by analysis of 11,661 diagnostic respiratory samples collected in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, over 3 years between July 2006 and June 2009 using a novel four-way multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. Coronaviruses were detected in 0.3 to 0.85% of samples in all age groups. Generally, coronaviruses displayed marked winter seasonality between the months of December and April and were not detected in summer months, which is comparable to the pattern seen with influenza viruses. HCoV-229E was the exception; detection was confined to the winter of 2008 and was sporadic in the following year. There were additional longer-term differences in detection frequencies between seasons, with HCoV-OC43 predominant in the first and third seasons and HCoV-HKU1 dominating in the second (see Results for definitions of seasons). A total of 11 to 41% of coronaviruses detected were in samples testing positive for other respiratory viruses, although clinical presentations of coronavirus monoinfections were comparable to those of viruses which have an established role in respiratory disease, such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses.

We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. Findings: Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease.

Methods: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. Findings: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.

Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.\",\"published_in\":\"The Lancet\",\"year\":\"2020-01-30\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thelancet.com\\/journals\\/lancet\\/article\\/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7\\/fulltext\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"pneumonia, exposure to animal host\",\"subject\":\"pneumonia, exposure to animal host\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thelancet.com\\/action\\/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930211-7\",\"relevance\":52,\"comments\":[{\"comment\":\"Early article describing the characteristics, clinical course and exposure to seafood market for 99 patients\",\"author\":\"ReFigure Team\"}],\"tags\":\"Early report\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Clinical characteristics, Frequent neurologic, Immune responses\",\"x\":\"0.114571779941577\",\"y\":\"0.175697452299896\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Host biology and clinical findings\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/S1473-3099(20)30196-1\",\"title\":\"Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study\",\"authors\":\"To, K.K.W.,  Tsang, O.T.Y., Leung, W.S., Tam, A.R., Wu, T.C., Lung, D.C.,  Yip, C.C.Y.,  Cai, J.P., Chan, J.M.C., Chik, T.S.H., Lau, D.P.L., Choi, C.Y.C., Chen, L.L., Chan, W.M., Chan, K.H., Ip, J.D.,  Ng, A.C.K., Poon, R.

Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. Methods: We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. Findings: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37\\u201375]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5\\u00b72 log10 copies per mL (IQR 4\\u00b71\\u20137\\u00b70). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope \\u22120\\u00b715, 95% CI \\u22120\\u00b719 to \\u22120\\u00b711; R2=0\\u00b771). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's \\u03c1=0\\u00b748, 95% CI 0\\u00b7074\\u20130\\u00b775; p=0\\u00b7020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (R2>0\\u00b79). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. Interpretation: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis.\",\"published_in\":\"The Lancet\",\"year\":\"2020-03-23\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/S1473-3099(20)30196-1\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"antibodies, anti-RBD\",\"subject\":\"antibodies, anti-RBD\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thelancet.com\\/pdfs\\/journals\\/laninf\\/PIIS1473-3099(20)30196-1.pdf\",\"relevance\":53,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Acute respiratory\",\"x\":\"0.0270141829225272\",\"y\":\"-0.00609154181132296\",\"area_uri\":5,\"area\":\"Immunity\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.refigure.org\\/collections\\/item\\/82e7a9e0-7aae-11ea-84c1-45a2d98aca4c\\/\",\"title\":\"Could BCG vaccine help to alleviate COVID-19 infection and reduce mortality?\",\"authors\":\"Lokhmanenko, A.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Bacillus Calmette\\u2013Guerin (BCG) vaccine is given in large parts of the world to reduce TB infections.

Based on this observation scientists hypothesized that BCG vaccination may have prevented severe symptoms of COVID-19 and the death rate associated with the disease. Different strains of BCG vaccine were developed since it had been introduced in 1921. Each strain had certain immunological characteristics. The early vaccines were detected in the lymph nodes of vaccinated children up to 6 months and produced methoxymycolate, the potent immunostimulant. The late vaccines did not reveal the live bacteria in the newly vaccinated children and were deficient in methoxymycolic acids. Also, BCG vaccine showed the ability to prevent acute respiratory infections in the elderly. Given this and other statistical information, it may be sensible to use BCG vaccination for elderly and health care workers to reduce the risk of COVID-19.\",\"published_in\":\"ReFigure\",\"year\":\"2020-04-28\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.refigure.org\\/collections\\/item\\/82e7a9e0-7aae-11ea-84c1-45a2d98aca4c\\/\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"BCG, tuberculosis\",\"subject\":\"BCG, tuberculosis\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"\",\"relevance\":54,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"ReFigure\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Covid19 vaccine, Clinical endpoints, Comprehensive status\",\"x\":\"-0.309391661922298\",\"y\":\"0.0808276720742284\",\"area_uri\":5,\"area\":\"Immunity\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.cell.2020.04.013\",\"title\":\"SnapShot: COVID-19\",\"authors\":\"Oberfeld, Blake; Achanta, Aditya; Carpenter, Kendall; Chen, Pamela; Gilette, Nicole M.; Langat, Pinky; Said, Jordan T., Schiff, Abigail E.; Zhou, Allen S.; Barczak, Amy K.; Pillai, Shiv\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.

In detail, SARS-CoV-2 causes: (1) maternal viremia, (2) placental infection demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and very high viral load; placental inflammation, as shown by histological examination and immunohistochemistry, and (3) neonatal viremia following placental infection. The neonate is studied clinically, through imaging, and followed up. The neonate presented with neurological manifestations, similar to those described in adult patients.\",\"published_in\":\"Science \",\"year\":\"2020-07-13\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/science.sciencemag.org\\/content\\/early\\/2020\\/07\\/10\\/science.abc6027\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"susceptibility, severity\",\"subject\":\"susceptibility, severity\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/science.sciencemag.org\\/content\\/sci\\/early\\/2020\\/07\\/10\\/science.abc6027.full.pdf\",\"relevance\":68,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Antibody tests, Disease progression, Humoral immune\",\"x\":\"0.0637529716308734\",\"y\":\"-0.156843916649919\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Host biology and clinical findings\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/articles\\/d41586-020-01989-z\",\"title\":\"Six months of coronavirus: the mysteries scientists are still racing to solve\",\"authors\":\"Callaway, Ewen; Ledford, Heidi; Mallapaty, Smriti\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Genetic variants that affect the clinical outcomes have been found with an emphasis on searching for mutations that may have greater significance. \\nThe lasting immunity provided by neutralizing antibodies have been seen to persist for weeks after infection, with more severe infections leading to more neutralized bodies.

Identifying the main mutation of the virus that emerged in February and is present all over the world has not been as helpful to determine how it affects human infections. The effectiveness of approximately 200 vaccines in development will be known in the coming months as they will be trialed in humans then compared to the animal trials that have been done and show that that the vaccines are more likely to reduce the severity of the virus rather than the transmission of the virus itself. Another baffling question being researched is the origin of the virus itself. While scientists have identified two species of horseshoe bats to naturally carry coronaviruses that are over 90% similar to COVID-19, the remaining 4-7% difference indicates that the virus has evolved before it infected human hosts. \\n\",\"published_in\":\"Nature Research\",\"year\":\"2020-07-03\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/articles\\/d41586-020-01989-z\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"coronavirus mysteries; months coronavirus; mysteries scientists\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/media.nature.com\\/original\\/magazine-assets\\/d41586-020-01989-z\\/d41586-020-01989-z.pdf\",\"relevance\":69,\"comments\":[{\"comment\":\"Excellent overview that comprehensively breaks down the answers researchers have found, and the challenges they will have to overcome to fully understand the virus.  \",\"author\":\"Refigure Team\"}],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Review\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Cell infection, Covid19 infection, Endothelial cell\",\"x\":\"0.128160426954179\",\"y\":\"-0.0701566757843505\",\"area_uri\":8,\"area\":\"Introduction to SARS-COV2 research\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/articles\\/s41586-020-2550-z\",\"title\":\"SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls\",\"authors\":\"Le Bert, Nina; Tan, A.

Little is known about the presence of pre-existing memory T cells in humans with the potential to recognize SARS-CoV-2. Here, we first studied T cell responses to structural (nucleocapsid protein, NP) and non-structural (NSP-7 and NSP13 of ORF1) regions of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescents (n=36). In all of them we demonstrated the presence of CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing multiple regions of the NP protein. We then showed that SARS-recovered patients (n=23) still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS-NP 17 years after the 2003 outbreak, which displayed robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP. Surprisingly, we also frequently detected SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells in individuals with no history of SARS, COVID-19 or contact with SARS\\/COVID-19 patients (n=37). SARS-CoV-2 T cells in uninfected donors exhibited a different pattern of immunodominance, frequently targeting the ORF-1-coded proteins NSP7 and 13 as well as the NP structural protein. Epitope characterization of NSP7-specific T cells showed recognition of protein fragments with low homology to \\u201ccommon cold\\u201d human coronaviruses but conserved amongst animal betacoranaviruses. Thus, infection with betacoronaviruses induces multispecific and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP. Understanding how pre-existing NP- and ORF-1-specific T cells present in the general population impact susceptibility and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\",\"published_in\":\"Nature\",\"year\":\"2020-07-15\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/articles\\/s41586-020-2550-z\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"Vaccine; T-cell response; immunity\",\"subject\":\"Vaccine; T-cell response; immunity\",\"oa_state\":3,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/articles\\/s41586-020-2550-z_reference.pdf\",\"relevance\":70,\"comments\":[{\"comment\":\"Thank you to Matthew Harrison for bringing this article to our attention.\",\"author\":\"\"}],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Cell epitopes\",\"x\":\"-0.0623087226110031\",\"y\":\"-0.14760320562404\",\"area_uri\":5,\"area\":\"Immunity\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.07.09.20148429v1\",\"title\":\"Longitudinal evaluation and decline of antibody responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection\",\"authors\":\"Seow, J.,Graham, C., Merrick, B., Acors, S., Steel , K.

However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from re-infection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we show seroconversion in >95% of cases and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when sampled beyond 8 days POS. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the nAb response is dependent upon the disease severity, but this does not affect the kinetics of the nAb response. Declining nAb titres were observed during the follow up period. Whilst some individuals with high peak ID50 (>10,000) maintained titres >1,000 at >60 days POS, some with lower peak ID50 had titres approaching baseline within the follow up period. A similar decline in nAb titres was also observed in a cohort of seropositive healthcare workers from Guy\\u2032s and St Thomas\\u2032 Hospitals. We suggest that this transient nAb response is a feature shared by both a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes low disease severity and the circulating seasonal coronaviruses that are associated with common colds.

Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. Methods. Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation. Findings. All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1\\u00b70\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910\\u2079 cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8\\u20139 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9\\u201310. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. Interpretation. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia.

Some individuals may have primary immunodeficiencies that predispose to severe infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\\n\\nObjective:  To explore the presence of genetic variants associated with primary immunodeficiencies among young patients with COVID-19.\\n\\nDesign, Setting, and Participants:  Case series of pairs of brothers without medical history meeting the selection criteria of young (age <35 years) brother pairs admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe COVID-19. Four men from 2 unrelated families were admitted to the ICUs of 4 hospitals in the Netherlands between March 23 and April 12, 2020. The final date of follow-up was May 16, 2020. Available family members were included for genetic variant segregation analysis and as controls for functional experiments.\\n\\nExposure  Severe COVID-19:\\n\\nMain Outcome and Measures:  Results of rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing, performed to identify a potential monogenic cause. Subsequently, basic genetic and immunological tests were performed in primary immune cells isolated from the patients and family members to characterize any immune defects.\\n\\nResults:  The 4 male patients had a mean age of 26 years (range, 21-32), with no history of major chronic disease. They were previously well before developing respiratory insufficiency due to severe COVID-19, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The mean duration of ventilatory support was 10 days (range, 9-11); the mean duration of ICU stay was 13 days (range, 10-16). One patient died. Rapid clinical whole-exome sequencing of the patients and segregation in available family members identified loss-of-function variants of the X-chromosomal TLR7. In members of family 1, a maternally inherited 4-nucleotide deletion was identified (c.2129_2132del; p.[Gln710Argfs*18]); the affected members of family 2 carried a missense variant (c.2383G>T; p.[Val795Phe]). In primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients, downstream type I interferon (IFN) signaling was transcriptionally downregulated, as measured by significantly decreased mRNA expression of IRF7, IFNB1, and ISG15 on stimulation with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod as compared with family members and controls. The production of IFN-\\u03b3, a type II IFN, was decreased in patients in response to stimulation with imiquimod.\\n\\nConclusions and Relevance:  In this case series of 4 young male patients with severe COVID-19, rare putative loss-of-function variants of X-chromosomal TLR7 were identified that were associated with impaired type I and II IFN responses. These preliminary findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19.\",\"published_in\":\"JAMA\",\"year\":\"2020-07-24\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/jamanetwork.com\\/journals\\/jama\\/fullarticle\\/2768926\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"Male disease severity\",\"subject\":\"Male disease severity\",\"oa_state\":3,\"link\":\"Only able to download with an account\",\"relevance\":84,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Clinical characteristics, Frequent neurologic, Immune responses\",\"x\":\"-0.0484157482998003\",\"y\":\"0.123279542312712\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Host biology and clinical findings\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S1931312820304017?via%3Dihub\",\"title\":\"Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study Shows Early Interferon Therapy Is Associated with Favorable Clinical Responses in COVID-19 Patients\",\"authors\":\"Wang,Nan; Zhan,Yan; Zhu, Linyu; Hou, Zhibing; Liu, Feng; Song, Pinhong; Qiu, Feng; Wang, Xiaolin; Zou, Xiafei; Wan, Deyun; Qian, Xiaosong; Wang, Shanshan; Guo, Yabi; Yu, Hao; Cui, Miao; Tong, Gangling; Xu, Yunsheng; Zheng, Zhihua; Lu, Yingying; Hong, Peng\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Interferons (IFNs) are widely used in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, a recent report of ACE2, the host factor mediating SARS-Cov-2 infection, identifying it as interferon-stimulated raised considerable safety concern. To examine the association between the use and timing of IFN-a2b and clinical outcomes, we analyzed in a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 446 COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. Regression models estimated that early administration (%5 days after admission) of IFN-a2b was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in comparison with no admission of IFN-a2b, whereas late administration of IFN-a2b was associated with increased mortality. Among survivors, early IFN-a2b was not associated with hospital discharge or computed tomography (CT) scan improvement, whereas late IFN-a2b was associated with delayed recovery. Additionally, early IFN-a2b and umifenovir alone or together were associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery in comparison with treatment with lopinavir\\/ritonavir (LPV\\/r) alone.

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of this interaction confers potent neutralization of viral entry, providing an avenue for vaccine design and for therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that potently disrupt the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2. By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked into their inaccessible down-state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains stability and function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment. These properties may enable aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia, promising to yield a widely deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic and\\/or early infection therapeutic agent to stem the worst pandemic in a century.\",\"published_in\":\"Biorxiv\",\"year\":\"2020-08-08\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.biorxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.08.08.238469v1\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"spike protein; therapeutic; single-domain antibodies; nanobodies; ACE2\",\"subject\":\"spike protein; therapeutic; single-domain antibodies; nanobodies; ACE2\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.biorxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.08.08.238469v1.full.pdf\",\"relevance\":88,\"comments\":[{\"comment\":\"This pre-print describes synthetic nanobodies that could be converted into a dry powder and aerosolized, potentially making the therapeutic self-administered and usable prophylactically.

This paper aims at addressing briefly the protective roles of ACE-2 in the lungs and the brain based on previous literature review and studies on other viruses that also use ACE-2 as a target for cellular entry. We hypothesized that COVID-19 pathology may be a consequence of viral Mediated down-regulation of ACE-2. In addition, we provided insights on the potential correlation between COVID-19 severity and male gender or smoking.\",\"published_in\":\"AfricArXiv Preprints\",\"year\":\"2020-04-02\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/osf.io\\/preprints\\/africarxiv\\/e7bk4\\/\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"ACE-2, COVID-19, Pathology, SARS-CoV-2, Smoking\",\"subject\":\"ACE-2, COVID-19, Pathology, SARS-CoV-2, Smoking\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/osf.io\\/preprints\\/africarxiv\\/e7bk4\\/\",\"relevance\":98,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Preprint\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Cell infection, Covid19 infection, Endothelial cell\",\"x\":\"0.108903490998273\",\"y\":\"-0.0480280938861603\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Host biology and clinical findings\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.scienceopen.com\\/document\\/read?vid=472c4fe4-ecf7-4588-9c2e-d17d19638e1a\",\"title\":\"Identification of Falsified Chloroquine Tablets in Africa at the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic\",\"authors\":\"Gnegel, Gesa; Hauk, Cathrin; Neci, Richard; Mutombo, Georges; Nyaah, Fidelis; Wistuba, Dorothee; H\\u00e4fele-Abah, Christine; Heide, Lutz\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Reports that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be effective against COVID-19 have received worldwide attention, increasing the risk of the introduction of falsified versions of these medicines.

To investigate the introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for contact tracing informed by genetic data.\",\"published_in\":\"MedRxiv\",\"year\":\"2020-08-25\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.08.23.20178236v1\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"genetic analysis, virus mutations, genetic epidemiology\",\"subject\":\"genetic analysis, virus mutations, genetic epidemiology\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medrxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.08.23.20178236v1.full.pdf\",\"relevance\":102,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Preprint\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Chain reaction, Clinical presentations, Coronavirus 2019-ncov\",\"x\":\"0.21884878826728\",\"y\":\"0.226357961480126\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Epidemiology\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.jpeds.com\\/article\\/S0022-3476(20)31023-4\\/fulltext\",\"title\":\"Pediatric SARS-CoV-2: Clinical Presentation, Infectivity, and Immune Responses\",\"authors\":\"Yonker, Lael M; Neilan, Anne M; Bartsch, Yannic; Patel, Ankit B; Regan, James; Arya, Puneeta; Gootkind, Elizabeth; Park, Grace; Hardcastle, Margot; St. John, Anita; Appleman, Lori; Chiu, Michelle L; Fialkowski, Allison; De la Flor, Denis; Lima, Rosiane; Bordt, Evan A; Yockey, Laura J; D\\u2019Avino, Paolo; Fischinger, Stephanie; Shui, Jessica E; Lerou, Paul H; Bonventre, Joseph V; Yu, Xu G; Ryan, Edward T; Bassett, Ingrid V; Irimia, Daniel; Edlow, Andrea G; Alter, Galit; Li, Jonathan Z; Fasano, Alessio.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"As schools plan for re-opening, understanding the potential role children play in the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the factors that drive severe illness in children is critical.

By focusing our analysis on patients with moderate disease who had not received immunomodulatory medications, our results revealed that male patients had higher plasma levels of innate immune cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18 along with more robust induction of non-classical monocytes.

Bradykinin is a potent part of the vasopressor system that induces hypotension and vasodilation and is degraded by ACE and enhanced by the angiotensin1-9 produced by ACE2. Here, we perform a new analysis on gene expression data from cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients that were used to sequence the virus. Comparison with BALF from controls identifies a critical imbalance in RAS represented by decreased expression of ACE in combination with increases in ACE2, renin, angiotensin, key RAS receptors, kinogen and many kallikrein enzymes that activate it, and both bradykinin receptors. This very atypical pattern of the RAS is predicted to elevate bradykinin levels in multiple tissues and systems that will likely cause increases in vascular dilation, vascular permeability and hypotension.

The clinical characteristics, underlying stroke mechanism, and outcomes in this particular subset of patients are especially salient as therapeutic anticoagulation becomes increasingly common in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic complications of COVID-19.                                                                                                                                          Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with hemorrhagic stroke (both non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage and spontaneous non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage) who were hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, within a major healthcare system in New York, during the coronavirus pandemic. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke on admission and who developed hemorrhage during hospitalization were both included. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with hemorrhagic stroke and COVID-19 to those without COVID-19 admitted to our hospital system between March 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020 (contemporary controls), and March 1, 2019, and May 15, 2019 (historical controls). Demographic variables and clinical characteristics between the individual groups were compared using Fischer\\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and nonparametric test for continuous variables. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method.              Results: During the study period in 2020, out of 4071 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19, we identified 19 (0.5%) with hemorrhagic stroke. Of all COVID-19 with hemorrhagic stroke, only three had isolated non-aneurysmal SAH with no associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Among hemorrhagic stroke in patients with COVID-19, coagulopathy was the most common etiology (73.7%); empiric anticoagulation was started in 89.5% of these patients versus 4.2% in contemporary controls (p \\u2264 .001) and 10.0% in historical controls (p \\u2264 .001). Compared to contemporary and historical controls, patients with COVID-19 had higher initial NIHSS scores, INR, PTT, and fibrinogen levels. Patients with COVID-19 also had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (84.6% vs. 4.6%, p \\u2264 0.001). Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with strictly subarachnoid hemorrhage yielded similar results.                                                                                                                           Conclusion: We observed an overall low rate of imaging-confirmed hemorrhagic stroke among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Most hemorrhages in patients with COVID-19 infection occurred in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation and were associated with increased mortality. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.\",\"published_in\":\"Neurocrit Care\",\"year\":\"2020-08-24\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1007%2Fs12028-020-01077-0\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"coagulation, coagulopathy, clotting, blood clot\",\"subject\":\"coagulation, coagulopathy, clotting, blood clot\",\"oa_state\":3,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/content\\/pdf\\/10.1007\\/s12028-020-01077-0.pdf\",\"relevance\":108,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Clinical characteristics, Frequent neurologic, Immune responses\",\"x\":\"-0.0713263509376738\",\"y\":\"0.21019060246941\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Host biology and clinical findings\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.biorxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.06.25.169946v2\",\"title\":\"Neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 in human and mouse brain\",\"authors\":\"Song, Eric; Zhang, Ce; Israelow, Benjamin; Lu-Culligan, Alice; Vieites Prado, Alba; Skriabine, Sophie; Lu,  Peiwen; Weizman, Orr-El; Liu, Feimei; Dai, Yile; Szigeti-Buck, Klara; Yasumoto, Yuki; Wang, Guilin; Castaldi, Christopher; Heltke, Jaime; Ng, Evelyn; Wheeler, John; Madel Alfajaro, Mia; Levavasseur, Etienne; Fontes, Benjamin; Ravindra, Neal G; Van Dijk, David; Mane, Shrikant; Gunel, Murat; Ring, Aaron; Kazmi, Syed A.

Yet, there is no consensus whether the virus can infect the brain, or what the consequences of CNS infection are. Here, we used three independent approaches to probe the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brain. First, using human brain organoids, we observed clear evidence of infection with accompanying metabolic changes in the infected and neighboring neurons. However, no evidence for the type I interferon responses was detected. We demonstrate that neuronal infection can be prevented either by blocking ACE2 with antibodies or by administering cerebrospinal fluid from a COVID-19 patient. Second, using mice overexpressing human ACE2, we demonstrate in vivo that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, but not respiratory infection, is associated with mortality. Finally, in brain autopsy from patients who died of COVID-19, we detect SARS-CoV-2 in the cortical neurons, and note pathologic features associated with infection with minimal immune cell infiltrates. These results provide evidence for the neuroinvasive capacity of SARS-CoV2, and an unexpected consequence of direct infection of neurons by SARS-CoV-2.\",\"published_in\":\"Biorxiv\",\"year\":\"2020-06-25\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.biorxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.06.25.169946v2\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"mouse brain; human mouse; neuroinvasion sars\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.biorxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.06.25.169946v2.full.pdf\",\"relevance\":110,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Preprint\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Cell infection, Covid19 infection, Endothelial cell\",\"x\":\"0.0414479177315142\",\"y\":\"-0.131789488315877\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Host biology and clinical findings\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/refigure.org\\/collections\\/item\\/721a30a0-e607-11ea-8848-1b45dc6f3e6a\\/\",\"title\":\"COVID-19 Infection and Severity in Men and Women\",\"authors\":\"Castillo, Stephany \",\"paper_abstract\":\"The risk of COVID-19 infection and severity have been found to differ in men and women. \\nThis is a collection of figures from different research papers that have been compiled using Refigure to show the differences in COVID-19 infection rate and severity between men and women. \\n\\nWhile women are infected in higher numbers than men (Fig 1, Gudbjartsson et al), men often face higher severity of the virus (Fig 2, Jin et al), which leads to longer hospital stays and deaths (Fig 5, Montopoli et al).\\n\\nCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that was found in bats before it was transmitted to humans.

The host cell then replicates the virus RNA, and assembles a new virus particle that is released from the cell and into the rest of the body, where it will continue to infect other cells (Fig. 3, Salvati et al).\\n\\nWomen have more progesterone, which increases ACE2 expression, which would put them at a higher risk of infection, while men have higher ACE2 expression in the lungs which would lead to more severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 (Fig. 3, Salvati et al).

Compared to PCR and serology tests, SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays are underdeveloped, despite their potential to identify active infection and monitor disease progression.                                  Methods: We used Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays to quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. We studied plasma from 64 COVID-19 positive patients, 17 COVID-19 negative patients, and 34 pre-pandemic patients. Combined with Simoa anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, we quantified changes in 31 SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers in 272 longitudinal plasma samples obtained for 39 COVID-19 patients. Data were analyzed by hierarchical clustering and were compared to longitudinal RT-PCR test results and clinical outcomes.

We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.\\nMethods: We did a phase 1\\/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18\\u201355 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5\\u2008\\u00d7\\u20081010 viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT50]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA50, MNA80, and MNA90]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-\\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606.\\nFindings: Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p<0\\u00b705). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493\\u20131802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96\\u2013317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360\\u2013792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA80 and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT50. After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA80 at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (R2=0\\u00b767 by Marburg VN; p<0\\u00b7001).\\nInterpretation: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses.

Healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups (5\\u2008\\u00d7\\u20081010, 1\\u2008\\u00d7\\u20081011, and 1\\u00b75\\u2008\\u00d7\\u20081011 viral particles) to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. T-cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assays. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04313127.\\nFindings: Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 36\\u00b73 years) were recruited and received the low dose (n=36), middle dose (n=36), or high dose (n=36) of the vaccine. All enrolled participants were included in the analysis. At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 (83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was noted within 28 days post-vaccination. ELISA antibodies and neutralising antibodies increased significantly at day 14, and peaked 28 days post-vaccination. Specific T-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination.\\nInterpretation:The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 post-vaccination. Our findings suggest that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine warrants further investigation.\\n\",\"published_in\":\"The Lancet\",\"year\":\"2020-05-22\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thelancet.com\\/journals\\/lancet\\/article\\/PIIS0140-6736(20)31208-3\\/fulltext#%20\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"Vaccine\",\"subject\":\"Vaccine\",\"oa_state\":3,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thelancet.com\\/action\\/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2931208-3\",\"relevance\":118,\"comments\":[{\"comment\":\"Coming up: The CoVis curation team is reviewing and comparing the findings from all COVID19 vaccine reports\",\"author\":\"\"}],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Vaccine against SARSCov2, Safety and immunogenicity, Preliminary report\",\"x\":\"-0.304129567396889\",\"y\":\"-0.0187263861193522\",\"area_uri\":0,\"area\":\"Vaccines\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.thelancet.com\\/journals\\/lancet\\/article\\/PIIS0140-6736(20)31866-3\\/fulltext\",\"title\":\"Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1\\/2 studies from Russia\",\"authors\":\"Logunov, Denis Y; Dolzhikova, Inna V; Zubkova, Olga V; Tukhvatullin, Amir I; Shcheblyakov, Dmitry V; Dzharullaeva, Alina S; Grousova, Daria M; Erokhova, Alina S; Kovyrshina, Anna V; Botikov, Andrei G; Izhaeva, Fatima M; Popova, Olga; Ozharovskaya, Tatiana A; Esmagambetov, Ilias B; Favorskaya, Irina A; Zrelkin, Denis I; Voronina, Daria V; Shcherbinin, Dmitry N; Semikhin, Alexander S; Simakova, Yana V; Tokarskaya, Elizaveta A; Lubenets, Nadezhda L; Egorova, Daria A; Shmarov, Maksim M; Nikitenko, Natalia A; Morozova, Lola F; Smolyarchuk, Elena A; Kryukov, Evgeny V; Babira, Vladimir F; Borisevich, Sergei V; Naroditsky, Boris S; Gintsburg, Alexander L.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: We developed a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of two components, a recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector and a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector, both carrying the gene for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and rAd5-S).

The reasons for the differences in clinical manifestations are unknown but suggest that age-dependent factors may modulate the antiviral immune response. We compared cytokine, humoral, and cellular immune responses in pediatric (children and youth, age <24 years) (n = 65) and adult (n = 60) patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at a metropolitan hospital system in New York City. The pediatric patients had a shorter length of stay, decreased requirement for mechanical ventilation, and lower mortality compared to adults. The serum concentrations of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and interferon-\\u03b3 (IFN-\\u03b3), but not tumor necrosis factor\\u2013\\u03b1 (TNF-\\u03b1) or IL-6, were inversely related to age. Adults mounted a more robust T cell response to the viral spike protein compared to pediatric patients as evidenced by increased expression of CD25+ on CD4+ T cells and the frequency of IFN-\\u03b3+ CD4+ T cells. Moreover, serum neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis were higher in adults compared to pediatric patients with COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody titer correlated positively with age and negatively with IL-17A and IFN-\\u03b3 serum concentrations. There were no differences in anti-spike protein antibody titers to other human coronaviruses. Together, these findings demonstrate that the poor outcome in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 compared to children may not be attributable to a failure to generate adaptive immune responses.\",\"published_in\":\"Science Translational Medicine\",\"year\":\"2020-10-07\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/stm.sciencemag.org\\/content\\/early\\/2020\\/09\\/21\\/scitranslmed.abd5487.full\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"Vaccine\",\"subject\":\"Vaccine\",\"oa_state\":3,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/stm.sciencemag.org\\/content\\/12\\/564\\/eabd5487.full.pdf\",\"relevance\":120,\"comments\":[{\"comment\":\"Coming up: The CoVis curation team is reviewing and comparing the findings from all COVID19 vaccine reports\",\"author\":\"\"}],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Clinical characteristics, Frequent neurologic, Immune responses\",\"x\":\"-0.0856014811490757\",\"y\":\"-0.0485316178781503\",\"area_uri\":0,\"area\":\"Vaccines\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/science.sciencemag.org\\/content\\/early\\/2020\\/09\\/28\\/science.abd4570.full\",\"title\":\"Inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19\",\"authors\":\"Zhang, Qian; Bastard, Paul; Liu, Zhiyong; Pen, J\\u00e9r\\u00e9mie Le; Moncada-Velez, Marcela; Chen, Jie; Ogishi, Masato; Sabli, Ira K.

This is attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on the host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances. The COVID-19 pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after Spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted immune-potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this virus. This review is aimed at providing an overview of the efforts dedicated to an effective vaccine for this novel coronavirus which has crippled the world in terms of economy, human health and life.\",\"published_in\":\"Virus Research\",\"year\":\"2020-08-13\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC7423510\\/\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"a comprehensive; comprehensive status; status report\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC7423510\\/pdf\\/main.pdf\",\"relevance\":126,\"comments\":[{\"comment\":\"2 reviews (including this one) were included in CoVis in November to provide comprehensive look at vaccine efforts\",\"author\":\"\"}],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Journal Article\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Covid19 vaccine, Clinical endpoints, Comprehensive status\",\"x\":\"-0.225732756498633\",\"y\":\"0.0316440652901951\",\"area_uri\":0,\"area\":\"Vaccines\"},{\"id\":\"https:\\/\\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\\/doi\\/full\\/10.1002\\/acn3.51210\",\"title\":\"Frequent neurologic manifestations and encephalopathy\\u2010associated morbidity in Covid\\u201019 patients\",\"authors\":\"Liottaa, Eric M; Batraa, Ayush; Clark, Jeffrey R; Shlobin, Nathan A; Hoffman, Steven C; Orban, Zachary S; Koralnik, Igor J.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Objective:                                                                                                                                   Covid\\u201019 can involve multiple organs including the nervous system.

Animal models demonstrating end-organ protection in C3-deficient mice and evidence of complement activation in humans have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 triggers complement-mediated endothelial damage, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (subunit 1 and 2), but not the N protein, directly activates the alternative pathway of complement (APC). Complement-dependent killing using the modified Ham test is blocked by either C5 or factor D inhibition. C3 fragments and C5b-9 are deposited on TF1PIGAnull target cells, and complement factor Bb is increased in the supernatant from spike protein\\u2013treated cells. C5 inhibition prevents the accumulation of C5b-9 on cells, but not C3c; however, factor D inhibition prevents both C3c and C5b-9 accumulation. Addition of factor H mitigates the complement attack. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins convert nonactivator surfaces to activator surfaces by preventing the inactivation of the cell-surface APC convertase. APC activation may explain many of the clinical manifestations (microangiopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal injury, and thrombophilia) of COVID-19 that are also observed in other complement-driven diseases such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

One of the \\u0394H69\\/V70+ N501Y lineages, B.1.1.7, is comprised of over 1400 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the UK and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 (\\u0394H69\\/V70 and \\u0394144\\/145) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). Some of these mutations have possibly arisen as a result of the virus evolving from immune selection pressure in infected individuals and possibly only one chronic infection in the case of lineage B.1.1.7. We find the \\u0394H69\\/V70 enhances viral infectivity, indicating its effect on virus fitness is independent to the N501Y RBM change. Enhanced surveillance for the \\u0394H69\\/V70 deletion with and without RBD mutations should be considered as a priority. Such \\u201cpermissive\\u201d mutations have the potential to enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to generate vaccine escape variants that would have otherwise significantly reduced viral fitness.\",\"published_in\":\"BioRxiv\",\"year\":\"2020-12-21\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.biorxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.12.14.422555v3\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"deletion \\u03b4h; emergence transmission; recurrent emergence\",\"oa_state\":1,\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.biorxiv.org\\/content\\/10.1101\\/2020.12.14.422555v3.full.pdf\",\"relevance\":153,\"comments\":[],\"tags\":\"\",\"resulttype\":\"Preprint\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Cell infection, Covid19 infection, Endothelial cell\",\"x\":\"0.0585049497851782\",\"y\":\"-0.364818198549376\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Epidemiology\"}]",
