The size distribution was found to be typically bimodal with mode diameters and widths relatively stable throughout the year and the observation period. New particle formation was observed on 14.5% of all days without a seasonal preference. Particles typically grew only into the Aitken mode and did not reach cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) sizes on the time scale of several days. Growth of preexisting particles in the Aitken mode, on average, contributed very few CCN. We concluded that the dominant fraction of CCN at Jungfraujoch originated in the boundary layer. A number of approaches were used to distinguish free tropospheric (FT) conditions and episodes with planetary boundary layer (PBL) influence. In the absence of PBL injections, the concentration of particles larger than 90\\u2009nm (N90, roughly corresponding to the CCN concentration) reached a value ~40\\u2009cm\\u22123 while PBL influence caused N90 concentrations of several hundred or even 1000\\u2009cm\\u22123. Comparing three criteria for free tropospheric conditions, we found FT prevalence for 39% of the time with over 60% during winter and below 20% during summer. It is noteworthy that a simple criterion based on standard trace gas measurements appeared to outperform alternative approaches.\",\"project_id\":\"654109\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"Martin Steinbacher; Urs Baltensperger; Martine Collaud Coen; Stephan Henne; Nicolas Bukowiecki; Z.

Here, we present the results of a 12-month campaign of NPF observations at the high-altitude site Jungfraujoch (JFJ, 3'580 m a.s.l.). Our results show that NPF significantly adds to the total aerosol concentration at the JFJ and only occurs via previous precursor entrainment from the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Freshly nucleated particles do not directly grow to CCN size (90 nm) within observable time scales (max. 48h). The contribution of NPF to the CCN concentration is low within this time frame compared to other sources, such as PBL entrainment of larger particles. A multi-step growth mechanism is proposed which allows previously formed Aitken mode particles to add to the CCN concentration. A parameterization is derived to explain formation rates at the JFJ, showing that precursor concentration, PBL influence, and global radiation are the key factors controlling new particle formation at the site.\",\"project_id\":\"200020_152907\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"Ugo Molteni; Martin Gysel; Martin Steinbacher; Urs Baltensperger; Jasmin Tr\\u00f6stl; Josef Dommen; Nicolas Bukowiecki; Erik Herrmann; Christopher R.

The toxicity of such metals will depend on the their chemical state, size distribution, and mixing state. Using online soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SP-AMS), we quantified the mass of five metals (V, Ni, Fe, Na, and Ba) in HFO-PM soot particles produced by a marine diesel research engine. The in-soot metal concentrations were compared to in-PM2.5 measurements by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). We found that <3% of total PM2.5 metals was associated with soot particles, which may still be sufficient to influence in-cylinder soot burnout rates. Since these metals were most likely present as oxides, whereas studies on lower-temperature boilers report a predominance of sulfates, this result implies that the toxicity of HFO PM depends on its combustion conditions. Finally, we observed a 4-to-25-fold enhancement in the ratio V:Ni in soot particles versus PM2.5, indicating an enrichment of V in soot due to its lower nucleation\\/condensation temperature. As this enrichment mechanism is not dependent on soot formation, V is expected to be generally enriched within smaller HFO-PM particles from marine engines, enhancing its toxicity.\",\"project_id\":\"200021L_140590\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"Corbin, J.

We show here that neither BC nor soluble brC is the major light-absorbing carbon (LAC) species in HFO-combustion PM. Instead, \\u201ctar brC\\u201d dominates. This tar brC, previously identified only in open-biomass-burning emissions, shares key defining properties with BC: it is insoluble, refractory, and substantially absorbs visible and near-infrared light. Relative to BC, tar brC has a higher Angstrom absorption exponent (AAE) (2.5\\u20136, depending on the considered wavelengths), a moderately-high mass absorption efficiency (up to 50% of that of BC), and a lower ratio of sp2- to sp3-bonded carbon. Based on our results, we present a refined classification of atmospheric LAC into two sub-types of BC and two sub-types of brC. We apply this refined classification to demonstrate that common analytical techniques for BC must be interpreted with care when applied to tar-containing aerosols. The global significance of our results is indicated by field observations which suggest that tar brC already contributes to Arctic snow darkening, an effect which may be magnified over upcoming decades as Arctic shipping continues to intensify. Ship emissions are dominated by a different type of particle than once thought. Ships typically use heavy fuel oil for combustion, releasing small light-absorbing particles such as black and brown carbon (brC). However, the properties and composition of such ship-related carbonaceous emissions is not well-known, complicating the quantification of their climatic impacts. Using various analytical techniques, Joel Corbin from the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland and National Research Council Canada, and colleagues, demonstrate that light-absorbing particulates from heavy fuel oil are dominated by tar brC, an insoluble particulate with strong absorbance in the near infrared, previously associated only with biomass burning. This newly recognized source of tar brC motivates the identification and quantification of tar particulates in other environments affected by ship emissions, and necessitates a refined classification of light-absorbing particulates to avoid misinterpreting their source.\",\"project_id\":\"615922\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"Corbin, J.

One of the poorly understood processes is formation of mixed phase clouds (MPCs) via heterogeneous ice nucleation. Field measurements of the atmospheric ice phase in MPCs are challenging due to the presence of much more numerous liquid droplets. The Ice Selective Inlet (ISI) presented in this paper is a novel inlet designed to selectively sample pristine ice crystals in mixed phase clouds and extract the ice residual particles contained within the crystals for physical and chemical characterization. Using a modular setup composed of a cyclone impactor droplet evaporation unit and pumped counterflow virtual impactor (PCVI) the ISI segregates particles based on their inertia and phase exclusively extracting small ice particles between 5 and 20 \\u00b5m in diameter. The setup also includes optical particle spectrometers for analysis of the number size distribution and shape of the sampled hydrometeors. The novelty of the ISI is a droplet evaporation unit which separates liquid droplets and ice crystals in the airborne state thus avoiding physical impaction of the hydrometeors and limiting potential artefacts. The design and validation of the droplet evaporation unit is based on modelling studies of droplet evaporation rates and computational fluid dynamics simulations of gas and particle flows through the unit. Prior to deployment in the field an inter comparison of the optical particle size spectrometers and a characterization of the transmission efficiency of the PCVI was conducted in the laboratory. The ISI was subsequently deployed during the Cloud and Aerosol Characterization Experiment (CLACE) 2013 and 2014 \\u2013 two extensive international field campaigns encompassing comprehensive measurements of cloud microphysics as well as bulk aerosol ice residual and ice nuclei properties. The campaigns provided an important opportunity for a proof of concept of the inlet design. In this work we present the setup of the ISI including the modelling and laboratory characterization of its components as well as field measurements demonstrating the ISI performance and validating the working principle of the inlet. Finally measurements of biological aerosol during a Saharan dust event (SDE) are presented showing a first indication of enrichment of bio material in sub 2 \\u00b5m ice residuals.\",\"project_id\":\"200021L_135356\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"P.

A\\u00a0simple statistical model to predict the number of aerosols which activate to form cloud droplets in warm clouds has been established, based on regression analysis of data from four summertime Cloud and Aerosol Characterisation Experiments (CLACE) at the high-altitude site Jungfraujoch (JFJ). It is shown that 79\\u202f% of the observed variance in droplet numbers can be represented by a\\u00a0model accounting only for the number of potential cloud condensation nuclei (defined as number of particles larger than 80\\u202fnm in diameter), while the mean errors in the model representation may be reduced by the addition of further explanatory variables, such as the mixing ratios of O3, CO, and the height of the measurements above cloud base. The statistical model has a similar ability to represent the observed droplet numbers in each of the individual years, as well as for the two predominant local wind directions at the JFJ (northwest and southeast). Given the central European location of the JFJ, with air masses in summer being representative of the free troposphere with regular boundary layer in-mixing via convection, we expect that this statistical model is generally applicable to warm clouds under conditions where droplet formation is aerosol limited (i.e. at relatively high updraught velocities and\\/or relatively low aerosol number concentrations). A comparison between the statistical model and an established microphysical parametrization shows good agreement between the two and supports the conclusion that cloud droplet formation at the JFJ is predominantly controlled by the number concentration of aerosol particles. <\\/jats:p>\",\"project_id\":\"603445\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"C.

Vertical profiles of aerosol particle optical properties were explored in a case study near the San Pietro Capofiume\\u00a0(SPC) ground station during the PEGASOS Po Valley campaign in the summer of 2012. A Zeppelin NT airship was employed to investigate the effect of the dynamics of the planetary boundary layer at altitudes between \\u223c\\u2009\\u202f50 and 800\\u202fm above ground. Determined properties included the aerosol particle size distribution, the hygroscopic growth factor, the effective index of refraction and the light absorption coefficient. The first three parameters were used to retrieve the light scattering coefficient. Simultaneously, direct measurements of both the scattering and absorption coefficient were carried out at the SPC ground station. Additionally, a single wavelength polarization diversity elastic lidar system provided estimates of aerosol extinction coefficients using the Klett method to accomplish the inversion of the signal, for a vertically resolved comparison between in situ and remote-sensing results. Note, however, that the comparison was for the most part done in the altitude range where the overlap function is incomplete and accordingly uncertainties are larger. First, the airborne results at low altitudes were validated with the ground measurements. Agreement within approximately \\u00b125\\u00a0and \\u00b120\\u202f% was found for the dry scattering and absorption coefficient, respectively. The single scattering albedo, ranged between\\u00a00.83 and\\u00a00.95, indicating the importance of the absorbing particles in the Po Valley region.

Among the variety of particle types present in the atmosphere, black carbon (BC), emitted by combustion processes, is uniquely associated with harmful effects to the human body and substantial radiative forcing of the Earth. Pure BC is known to be non-hygroscopic, but its ability to acquire a coating of hygroscopic organic and inorganic material leads to increased hygroscopicity as well as diameter, facilitating droplet activation. This affects BC radiative forcing through aerosol-cloud interactions (aci) and BC life cycle. To gain insights into these processes, we performed a field campaign in winter 2015\\/16 in a residential area of Zurich which aimed at distinguishing different particle mixing states regarding hygroscopic properties in the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)-activated fraction spectrum of urban aerosol and establishing relations between the mixing state of BC and its activation to form droplets in fog. This was achieved by operating a CCN counter (CCNC), a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), a single particle soot photometer (SP2) and an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) behind a combination of a total- and an interstitial-aerosol inlet. Our results indicate that, depending on the time of the day, we sampled both heavily aged internally mixed BC from background air advected to the site and freshly emitted externally mixed BC from local or regional traffic sources. During rush hours in the morning of weekdays, we found clear evidence that the enhanced traffic emissions caused peaks in the number fraction of externally mixed BC particles which do not act as CCN within the CCNC. The mixing state of BC particles was also found to play a key role in their ability to form fog droplets. The very low effective peak supersaturations (SSpeak) occurring in fog (between approximately 0.03 and 0.06\\u2009% during this campaign) restrict droplet activation to a minor fraction of the aerosol burden (around 0.5 to 1\\u2009% of total particle number concentration between 20 and 593\\u2009nm) leading to very selective criteria on diameter and chemical composition. We show that bare BC cores are unable to activate to fog droplets at such low SSpeak, while BC particles surrounded by thick coating have a very similar activation behavior as BC-free particles. The threshold coating thickness required for activation was shown to decrease with increasing BC core size. Using simplified \\u03ba-K\\u00f6hler theory combined with the ZSR mixing rule assuming spherical core-shell particle geometry constrained with single particle measurements of respective volumes, we found good agreement between the predicted and the directly observed size and mixing state resolved droplet activation behaviour of BC-containing particles in fog. This successful closure demonstrates the predictability of their droplet activation in fog with a simplified theoretical model only requiring size and mixing state information, which can also be applied in a consistent manner in model simulations. <\\/jats:p>\",\"project_id\":\"615922\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"G.

Aerosol particles contribute to the climate forcing through their optical properties. Measuring these optical aerosol particle properties is still challenging, especially considering the hygroscopic growth of aerosol particles, which alters their optical properties. Lidar and in-situ techniques can derive a variety of aerosol optical properties, like aerosol particle light extinction, backscattering, and absorption. But these techniques are subject to some limitations and uncertainties. Within this study, we compared airborne in-situ based and, on Mie-theory based, modeled optical properties at dry state. At ambient state, modeled optical properties were compared with lidar-based estimates. Also, we examined the dependence of the aerosol particle light extinction-to-backscatter ratio, also lidar ratio, to relative humidity. The used model was fed with measured physicochemical aerosol properties and ambient atmospheric conditions. The model considered aerosol particles in an internal core-shell mixing state with constant volume fractions of the aerosol components over the entire observed aerosol particle size-range. The underlying set of measurements was conducted near the measurement site Melpitz, Germany, during two campaigns in summer, 2015, and winter, 2017, and represent Central European background aerosol conditions. Two airborne payloads deployed on a helicopter and a balloon provided measurements of microphysical and optical aerosol particle properties and were complemented by the polarization Raman lidar system PollyXT as well as by a holistic set of microphysical, chemical and optical aerosol measurements derived at ground level. Comparisons of calculated optical aerosol properties with ground-based in-situ measured aerosol optical properties at dry state showed an agreement of the model within 13\\u2009% (3\\u2009%) in terms of scattering at 450\\u2009nm wavelength during the winter (summer) campaign. The model also represented the aerosol particle light absorption at 637\\u2009nm within 8\\u2009% (18\\u2009%) during the winter (summer) campaign and agreed within 13\\u2009% with the airborne in-situ aerosol particle light extinction measurements during summer. During winter, in a comparatively clean case with equivalent black carbon mass-concentrations of around 0.2\\u2009\\u00b5g\\u2009m\\u22123 the modeled airborne measurement-based aerosol particle light absorption, was up to 32\\u201337\\u2009% larger than the measured values during a relatively clean period. However, during a high polluted case, with an equivalent black carbon mass concentration of around 4\\u2009\\u00b5g\\u2009m\\u22123, the modeled aerosol particle light absorption coefficient was, depending on the wavelength, 13\\u201332\\u2009% lower than the measured values. Spread and magnitude of the disagreement highlighted the importance of the aerosol mixing state used within the model, the requirement of the inclusion of brown carbon, and a wavelength-dependent complex refractive index of black and brown carbon when such kind of model is used to validate aerosol particle light absorption coefficient estimates of, e.g., lidar systems. Besides dry state comparisons, ambient modeled aerosol particle light extinction, as well as aerosol particle light backscattering, were compared with lidar estimates of these measures. During summer, on average, for four of the twelve conducted measurement flights, the model calculated lower aerosol particle light extinction (up to 29\\u2009% lower) as well as backscattering (up to 32\\u2009% lower) than derived with the lidar. In winter, the modeled aerosol particle light extinction coefficient was 17\\u2009%\\u201341\\u2009% lower, the aerosol particle light backscattering coefficient 14\\u2009%\\u201342\\u2009% lower than the lidar estimates. For both, the winter and summer cases, the Mie-model estimated reasonable extinction-to-backscatter (LR) ratios. Measurement-based Mie-modeling showed evidence of the dependence of the lidar ratio on relative humidity (RH). With this result, we presented a fit for lidar wavelengths of 355, 532, and 1064\\u2009nm with an underlying equation of fLR (RH,\\u03b3(\\u03bb))\\u2009=\\u2009fLR (RH\\u2009=\\u20090,\\u03bb)\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009(1\\u2009\\u2212\\u2009RH)(\\u2212\\u03b3(\\u03bb)) and estimates of \\u03b3(355\\u2009nm)\\u2009=\\u20090.29 (\\u00b10.01), \\u03b3(532\\u2009nm)\\u2009=\\u20090.48 (\\u00b10.01), and \\u03b3(1064\\u2009nm)\\u2009=\\u20090.31 (\\u00b10.01). However, further measurements are required to entangle the behavior of the lidar ratio with respect to different aerosol types, to set up a climatology, and to assess the influence of the aerosol mixing state. This comprehensive study combining airborne and ground-based in-situ and remote sensing measurements, which simulated multiple aerosol optical coefficients in the ambient and dry state, is with its complexity unique of its kind. <\\/jats:p>\",\"project_id\":\"615922\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"Sebastian D\\u00fcsing; Albert Ansmann; Holger Baars; Joel C.

Besides total mass loadings, diurnal variations and relative species contributions during the different meteorological seasons, geographical origin and sources of organic aerosol (OA) are discussed. Backward transport simulations shows that the highest (especially sulphate) concentrations of NR-PM1 were measured in air masses advected to the station from regions south of the JFJ while lowest concentrations were seen from western regions. OA source apportionment for each season was performed using the Source Finder (SoFi) interface for the multilinear engine (ME-2).

Vertical profiles of aerosol optical properties were explored in a case study near the San Pietro Capofiume (SPC) ground station during the PEGASOS Po Valley campaign in the summer of 2012. A Zeppelin NT airship was employed to investigate the effect of the dynamics of the planetary boundary layer at altitudes between ~ 50\\u2013800 m above ground. Determined properties included the aerosol size distribution, the hygroscopic growth factor, the effective index of refraction and the light absorption coefficient. The first three parameters were used to retrieve the light scattering coefficient. Simultaneously, direct measurements of both the scattering and absorption coefficient were carried out at the SPC ground station. Additionally, a LIDAR system provided aerosol extinction coefficients for a vertically resolved comparison between in-situ and remote sensing results. First, the airborne results at low altitudes were validated with the ground measurements. Agreement within approximately \\u00b125 and \\u00b120% was found for the dry scattering and absorption coefficient, respectively. The single scattering albedo, ranged between 0.83 to 0.95, indicating the importance of the absorbing particles in the Po Valley region. A clear layering of the atmosphere was observed during the beginning of the flight (until ~ 10 local time) before the mixed layer (ML) was fully developed. Highest extinction coefficients were found at low altitudes, in the new ML, while values in the residual layer, which could be probed at the beginning of the flight at elevated altitudes, were lower. At the end of the flight (after ~ 12 local time) the ML was fully developed, resulting in constant extinction coefficients at all altitudes measured on the Zeppelin NT. LIDAR results captured these dynamic features well and good agreement was found for the extinction coefficients compared to the in-situ results, using fixed LIDAR ratios (LR) between 30 and 70 sr for the altitudes probed with the Zeppelin.

Airborne measurements of the aerosol hygroscopic and optical properties as well as chemical composition were performed in the Netherlands and northern Italy on board of a Zeppelin NT airship during the PEGASOS field campaigns in 2012. The vertical changes in aerosol properties during the development of the mixing layer were studied. Hygroscopic growth factors (GF) at 95% relative humidity were determined using the white-light humidified optical particles spectrometer (WHOPS) for dry diameters of 300 and 500 nm particles. These measurements were supplemented by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and an aethalometer providing information on the aerosol chemical composition. Several vertical profiles between 100 and 700 m a.g. were flown just after sunrise close to the San Pietro Capofiume ground station in the Po Valley, Italy. During the early morning hours the lowest layer (newly developing mixing layer) contained a high nitrate fraction (20%) which was coupled with enhanced hygroscopic growth. In the layer above (residual layer) small nitrate fractions of ~ 2% were measured as well as low GFs. After full mixing of the layers, typically around noon and with increased temperature, the nitrate fraction decreased to 2% at all altitudes and led to similar hygroscopicity values as found in the residual layer. These distinct vertical and temporal changes underline the importance of airborne campaigns to study aerosol properties during the development of the mixed layer. The aerosol was externally mixed with 22 and 67% of the 500 nm particles in the range GF &lt; 1.1 and GF &gt; 1.5, respectively. Contributors to the non-hygroscopic mode in the observed size range are most likely mineral dust and biological material. Mean hygroscopicity parameters (\\u03ba) were 0.34, 0.19 and 0.18 for particles in the newly forming mixing layer, residual layer and fully mixed layer, respectively. These results agree well with those from chemical analysis which found values of \\u03ba = 0.27, 0.21 and 0.19 for the three layers. The highest \\u03ba values in the new mixed layer and lower values in the fully developed mixed layer were additionally confirmed by ground measurements. The aerosol sampled in the Netherlands did not show any altitude dependent characteristics because only the fully mixed layer or the entrainment zone between mixed and the residual layer were probed. The airborne hygroscopicity measurements agreed well with ground based composition measurements. However, the fraction of the hygroscopic particles (GF &gt; 1.5) was enhanced compared to the results from Italy amounting to 82%, while 12% showed low hygroscopicity (GF &lt; 1.1). The mean \\u03ba value measured by the WHOPS was 0.28 and therefore considerably higher than the value measured in the fully mixed layer in Italy.

The mass concentration of black carbon (BC) particles in the atmosphere has traditionally been quantified with two methods: as elemental carbon (EC) concentrations measured by thermal-optical analysis and as equivalent black carbon (eBC) concentrations when BC mass is derived from particle light absorption coefficient measurements. Over the last decade, ambient measurements of refractory black carbon (rBC) mass concentrations based on laser-induced incandescence (LII) have become more common, mostly due to the development of the Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) instrument. In this work, EC and rBC mass concentration measurements from field campaigns across several background European sites (Paris, Bologna, Cabauw and Melpitz) have been collated and examined to identify the similarities and differences between BC mass concentrations measured by the two techniques. All EC concentration measurements in PM2.5 were performed with the EUSAAR-2 thermal-optical protocol. All rBC concentration measurements were performed with SP2s calibrated with the same calibration material as recommended in the literature. The median ratio between observed rBC and EC mass concentrations was 0.92, when considering all data points from all five campaigns, and the corresponding geometric standard deviation (GSD) was 1.5. The minimal and maximal observed values of median rBC to EC mass concentration ratios on single campaign level were 0.53 and 1.29, respectively. This shows that substantial systematic bias between these two quantities occurred during some campaigns, which also contributes to the large overall GSD. On single campaign level, the relative spread of individual rBC to EC mass concentration ratios was typically between a factor of 1.2 and 1.3 (1 GSD), which indicates fairly good precision of both methods. Despite considerable variability of BC properties and sources across the whole data set, it was not possible to clearly assign reasons for discrepancies to one or the other method, both known to have their own specific limitations and uncertainties. However, differences in the particle size range covered by these two methods were identified as one likely reason for discrepancies. In particular, rBC to EC mass concentration ratios were found to be systematically less than unity, despite applying a correction for small BC cores that remain undetected by the SP2. This was observed when the rBC mass size distribution was shifted towards smaller modal diameter, which occurred during traffic emission dominated episodes. Overall, the high correlation between rBC and EC mass concentrations indicates that both methods essentially quantify the same property of atmospheric aerosols, whereas systematic differences in measured absolute values by up to a factor of 2 can occur. This finding for the level of agreement between two current state-of-the-art techniques has important implications for studies based on BC mass concentration measurements, for example for the interpretation of uncertainties of inferred BC mass absorption coefficient values, which are required for modelling the radiative forcing of BC.

Aerosol particles experience hygroscopic growth at enhanced relative humidity (RH) which leads to changes in their optical properties. We developed the white-light humidified optical particle spectrometer (WHOPS), a new instrument to investigate the particles' hygroscopic growth. Here we present a detailed technical description and characterization of the WHOPS in laboratory and field experiments. The WHOPS consists of a differential mobility analyzer, a humidifier\\/bypass and a WELAS (white-light aerosol spectrometer) connected in series to provide fast measurements of particle hygroscopicity at sub-saturated RH and optical properties on airborne platforms. The WELAS employs a white-light source to minimize ambiguities in the optical particle sizing. In contrast to other hygroscopicity instruments, the WHOPS retrieves information of relatively large particles (i.e. diameter D &gt; 280 nm), therefore investigating the more optically relevant size ranges. The effective index of refraction of the dry particles is retrieved from the optical diameter measured for size-selected aerosol samples with a well-defined dry mobility diameter. The data analysis approach for the optical sizing and retrieval of the index of refraction was extensively tested in laboratory experiments with polystyrene latex size standards and ammonium sulfate particles of different diameters. The hygroscopic growth factor (GF) distribution and aerosol mixing state is inferred from the optical size distribution measured for the size-selected and humidified aerosol sample. Laboratory experiments with pure ammonium sulfate particles revealed good agreement with K\\u00f6hler theory (mean bias of ~ 3% and maximal deviation of 9% for GFs at RH = 95%). First airborne measurements in the Netherlands observed GFs (mean value of the GF distribution) at RH = 95% between 1.74 and 2.67 with a median of 1.94 for particles with a dry diameter of 500 nm. This corresponds to hygroscopicity parameters (\\u03ba) between 0.21 and 0.93 with a median of 0.33. The GF distributions indicate externally mixed particles covering the whole range of GFs between ~ 1.0\\u20133.0. On average ~ 74% of the particles were \\\"more hygroscopic\\\" with GFs &gt; 1.5, ~ 15% were non- or slightly hygroscopic with GF &lt; 1.1 and the remaining ~ 11% were \\\"less hygroscopic\\\" with 1.1 &lt; GF &lt; 1.5. The more hygroscopic mode sometimes peaked at GF &gt; 2, indicating influence of sea salt particles, consistent with previous ground-based particle hygroscopicity measurements in this area.

The mass absorption cross section\\u00a0(MAC) determined for black carbon (BC, 13.7&thinsp;m<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\"><sup>2<\\/sup><\\/span>&thinsp;g<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\"><sup>\\u22121<\\/sup><\\/span> at 370&thinsp;nm, with geometric standard deviation GSD&thinsp;<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\">=1.1<\\/span>) was consistent with that recommended by Bond et al.\\u00a0(2006). The corresponding MAC of POA (5.5&thinsp;m<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\"><sup>2<\\/sup><\\/span>&thinsp;g<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\"><sup>\\u22121<\\/sup><\\/span>; GSD&thinsp;<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\">=1.2<\\/span>) was higher than that of SOA (2.4&thinsp;m<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\"><sup>2<\\/sup><\\/span>&thinsp;g<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\"><sup>\\u22121<\\/sup><\\/span>; GSD&thinsp;<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\">=1.3<\\/span>) at 370&thinsp;nm. However, SOA presents a substantial mass fraction, with a measured average SOA&thinsp;<span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\">\\u2215<\\/span>&thinsp;POA mass ratio after aging of <span class=\\\"inline-formula\\\">\\u223c5<\\/span> and therefore contributes significantly to the overall light absorption, highlighting the importance of wood-combustion SOA as a source of atmospheric brown carbon. The wavelength dependence of POA and SOA light absorption between 370 and 660&thinsp;nm is well described with absorption \\u00c5ngstr\\u00f6m exponents of 4.6 and 5.6, respectively. UV-visible absorbance measurements of water and methanol-extracted OA were also performed, showing that the majority of the light-absorbing OA is water insoluble even after aging.<\\/p>\",\"project_id\":\"730997\",\"accessright\":\"Open Access\",\"authors\":\"N.
