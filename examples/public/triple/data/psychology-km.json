The psychology of magic is a nascent field of research that examines the underlying mechanisms that conjurers use to achieve enchanting phenomena, including sensory illusions, misdirection of attention, and the appearance of mind-control and nuanced persuasion. Most studies to date have focused on either the psychological principles involved in watching and performing magic or \\u201cneuromagic\\u201d - the neural correlates of such phenomena. Whereas performers sometimes question the contributions that modern science may offer to the advancement of the magical arts, the history of magic reveals that scientific discovery often charts new territories for magicians. In this research topic we sketch out the symbiotic relationship between psychological science and the art of magic. On the one hand, magic can inform psychology, with particular benefits for the cognitive, social, developmental, and transcultural components of behavioural science. Magicians have a large and robust set of effects that most researchers rarely exploit. Incorporating these effects into existing experimental, even clinical, paradigms paves the road to innovative trajectories in the study of human behaviour. For example, magic provides an elegant way to study the behaviour of participants who may believe they had made choices that they actually did not make. Moreover, magic fosters a more ecological approach to experimentation whereby scientists can probe participants in more natural environments compared to the traditional lab-based settings. Examining how magicians consistently influence spectators, for example, can elucidate important aspects in the study of persuasion, trust, decision-making, and even processes spanning authorship and agency. Magic thus offers a largely underused armamentarium for the behavioural scientist and clinician. On the other hand, psychological science can advance the art of magic. The psychology of deception, a relatively understudied field, explores the intentional creation of false beliefs and how people often go wrong. Understanding how to methodically exploit the tenuous twilight zone of human vulnerabilities \\u2013 perceptual, logical, emotional, and temporal \\u2013 becomes all the more revealing when top-down influences, including expectation, symbolic thinking, and framing, join the fray. Over the years, science has permitted magicians to concoct increasingly effective routines and to elicit heightened feelings of wonder from audiences. Furthermore, on occasion science leads to the creation of novel effects, or the refinement of existing ones, based on systematic methods. For example, by simulating a specific card routine using a series of computer stimuli, researchers have decomposed the effect to assess its essential elements. Other magic effects depend on meaningful psychological knowledge, such as which type of information is difficult to retain or what changes capture attention. Behavioural scientists measure and study these factors. By combining analytical findings with performer intuitions, psychological science begets effective magic. Whereas science strives on parsimony and independent replication of results, magic thrives on reproducing the same effect with multiple methods to obscure parsimony and minimise detection.

This Research Topic explores the seemingly orthogonal approaches of scientists and magicians by highlighting the crosstalk as well as rapprochement between psychological science and the art of deception.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/directory.doabooks.org\\/handle\\/20.500.12854\\/57325\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"BF1-990; Q1-390\",\"subject\":\"magic magic; magic psychology; psychology magic\",\"concepts\":\"Agency (Philosophy); Agents; Agent (Philosophy); Person (Philosophy); Arts; Fine arts; Arts, Occidental; Arts, Fine; Arts, Western; Behavior, Human; Human beings--Behavior; Human action; Ethology; Human behavior; Action, Human; Concentration (Psychology); Flow (Psychology); Attention; History; Annals; Human emotions; Passions; Feelings; Emotions; Iconography; Art; Arts, Visual; Arts, Fine; Art, Occidental; Visual arts; Art, Visual; Western art (Western countries); Fine arts; Occidental art; Art, Western (Western countries); Industrial groupings; Industrial trusts; Commercial corners; Trusts, Industrial; Commercial trusts; Combinations in restraint of trade; Corners, Commercial; Industrial combinations; Economic concentration; Combinations, Industrial; Mass communication; Communication; Communication, Primitive; Psychology; Behavioral sciences; Mind; Mental philosophy; Science, Mental; Thinking; Thoughts; Thought and thinking; Mind\",\"concepts_en\":\"Agency (Philosophy); Agents; Agent (Philosophy); Person (Philosophy); Arts; Fine arts; Arts, Occidental; Arts, Fine; Arts, Western; Behavior, Human; Human beings--Behavior; Human action; Ethology; Human behavior; Action, Human; Concentration (Psychology); Flow (Psychology); Attention; History; Annals; Human emotions; Passions; Feelings; Emotions; Iconography; Art; Arts, Visual; Arts, Fine; Art, Occidental; Visual arts; Art, Visual; Western art (Western countries); Fine arts; Occidental art; Art, Western (Western countries); Industrial groupings; Industrial trusts; Commercial corners; Trusts, Industrial; Commercial trusts; Combinations in restraint of trade; Corners, Commercial; Industrial combinations; Economic concentration; Combinations, Industrial; Mass communication; Communication; Communication, Primitive; Psychology; Behavioral sciences; Mind; Mental philosophy; Science, Mental; Thinking; Thoughts; Thought and thinking; Mind\",\"oa_state\":2,\"link\":\"\",\"relevance\":13,\"cluster_labels\":\"Educational psychology, Integrative musical psychology\",\"x\":\"0.0591584406001372\",\"y\":\"-0.126306120911661\",\"area_uri\":8,\"area\":\"Educational psychology, Integrative musical psychology\"},{\"id\":\"20.500.12854\\/66060\",\"title\":\"Psychology\",\"title_en\":\"Psychology\",\"authors\":\"\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This book represents a selection of chapters that address several topics from the broad domains of psychology: alcoholism, clinical interventions, treatment of depression, personality psychology, qualitative research methods in psychology, and social psychology.

This is primarily related to the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between subjectivity and psychic reality. The introduction of psychic reality as the decisive factor in the emergence of pathology and relativization of real reality enabled psychoanalysis to shift the focus from the real, external, objective, and physical to the unconscious fantasies, by which the inner world got its rightful place in the construction of 'mental'. Although psychological reality is located in the unconscious as well, Freud did not intend to declare the whole experience as purely subjective, but he thought that experience reflects unconscious influences, more precisely, unconscious desires and fantasies. Since all forms of knowledge are subjective, therefore, subject to the influence of the unconscious, it seems that psychic reality and subjectivity reflect unconscious influences to varying degrees, i.e. they show varying degrees of objectivity. This is corroborated by conscious states such as guilt and anxiety, which are such only because they are the result of unconscious dynamics triggered by the transfer, switched to an objective situation. It is not debatable that the sensory data as perceptual knowledge of external objects have a greater degree of objectivity than pure fantasies which are largely subjective and are very little based on the objective. Stressing the importance of the psychological reality both for the structure and for the psychology that seeks to understand the same structure, we will stress the ubiquity of that reality based on the ability of an infant to form primitive object relations in reality and in fantasy from the very beginning of life. Already, at the very beginning of life, a child finds himself in a vicious circle where the real experiences inevitably influence the unconscious fantasy, and then the fantasy affects the reality. Such constructed psychic reality remains to exist during a lifetime in each subject. It is completely the same to say that the weight of the pathology determines the importance of the role of psychological reality or that any strengthening of psychic reality is reflected in the production of the pathological.\",\"paper_abstract_en\":\"There is still no precise answer what is generally considered a reality in psychology and what kind of reality is the object of psychological praxis. This is primarily related to the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between subjectivity and psychic reality. The introduction of psychic reality as the decisive factor in the emergence of pathology and relativization of real reality enabled psychoanalysis to shift the focus from the real, external, objective, and physical to the unconscious fantasies, by which the inner world got its rightful place in the construction of 'mental'.
