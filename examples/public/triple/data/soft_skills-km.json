To grasp the understanding of soft skills infusion into Russia\\u2019s university education, the authors conducted a study with a view to finding out the academic community\\u2019s perceptions of soft skills. The research entailed a theoretical and empirical stages, with the first one covering an analysis of literature on soft skills via comparative methods in order to come to a uniform definition and prevailing classification of soft skills (as a basis for questionnaires), and the surveying stage with 135 lecturers and 312 students involved. The findings implicate the participants\\u2019 perceptions of soft skills, most efficient academic disciplines and teaching\\/ learning techniques for fostering students\\u2019 soft skills and confirm the hypothesis that in Russia there are random soft skills inclusions in curricula and few practices to nurture the skills that justify the need for developing a new governmental policy to cover the gap.\",\"published_in\":\"Peoples\\u2019 Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University)\",\"year\":\"2018-12-01\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/74cff41f53594a43bebb1e940828514a\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"soft skills; soft skills; university; labour market; competiveness; transversal skills; Education; L; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"soft skills; soft skills; university; labour market; competiveness; transversal skills; Education; L; Psychology\",\"concepts\":\"Capitalism; Market economy; Civilisation; Barbarism; Civilization; Drama; Dramas; Dramatic works; Playscripts; Plays; Drama--Philosophy; Stage; Drama, Modern; Education; Pedagogy; Children--Education; Human resource development; Youth--Education; Education, Primitive; Education of children; Schooling; Instruction; Students--Education; Learning; Learning process; Literature; Western literature (Western countries); World literature; Belles-lettres; Mass communication; Communication, Primitive; Communication; Number concept; Theatre; Dramatics; Professional theater; Histrionics; Stage; Theater\",\"concepts_en\":\"Capitalism; Market economy; Civilisation; Barbarism; Civilization; Drama; Dramas; Dramatic works; Playscripts; Plays; Drama--Philosophy; Stage; Drama, Modern; Education; Pedagogy; Children--Education; Human resource development; Youth--Education; Education, Primitive; Education of children; Schooling; Instruction; Students--Education; Learning; Learning process; Literature; Western literature (Western countries); World literature; Belles-lettres; Mass communication; Communication, Primitive; Communication; Number concept; Theatre; Dramatics; Professional theater; Histrionics; Stage; Theater\",\"oa_state\":2,\"link\":\"\",\"relevance\":7,\"cluster_labels\":\"Higher education, Graduate, Competences in STEM\",\"x\":\"0.0143141464514403\",\"y\":\"0.0275898118147428\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Higher education, Graduate, Competences in STEM\"},{\"id\":\"oai:doaj.org\\/article:79ccb68c1c32493baad9fbccb8162f88\",\"title\":\"Integrating soft skills in higher education and the EFL classroom: Knowledge beyond language learning\",\"title_en\":\"Integrating soft skills in higher education and the EFL classroom: Knowledge beyond language learning\",\"authors\":\"Tevdovska Elena Spirovska\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of soft skills in the context of higher education and in the context of the foreign language learning classroom.

Results can be applied for developing policies aimed at eliminating the skill gap in prospective technological areas.\",\"published_in\":\"SAGE Publishing\",\"year\":\"2020-09-01\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/83d1b69c6d31416586d95615c10b3878\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"History of scholarship and learning.

The results of the study show that: First, Ushul Fiqh is a science that has latent potential to develop soft skills of students. Second, Ushul Fiqh which is considered as the Queen of Islamic science has a central role in realizing Islam as a religion of grace and humanity. From the epistemological aspect, the humanistic approach of Usul Fiqh will not only give birth to Islamic laws that \\\"take sides\\\" with humans, more than that, capable of forming humanists. Third, the development of soft skills through Ushul Fiqh learning was felt to be effective with the learning strategies of Value Clarification Learning, Active Learning, and Contextual Teaching and Leaning. In addition, the selection of examples of verses from the Qur'an that support the actualization of these values and the courage to give meaning to each of the subjects of Ushul fiqh. become one of the keys to achieving new behaviours for individuals. \\u00a0\",\"published_in\":\"Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) Mataram\",\"year\":\"2019-12-01\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b4d03f46726e44b886ce6061168a3a0c\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"Ushul Fiqh; Soft Skills; Pembelajaran; Model; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"Ushul Fiqh; Soft Skills; Pembelajaran; Model; Education; L\",\"concepts\":\"Learning; Learning process; Religion, Primitive; Religion; Value; Standard of value; Values; Axiology; Worth; Volition; Will; Conation\",\"concepts_en\":\"Learning; Learning process; Religion, Primitive; Religion; Value; Standard of value; Values; Axiology; Worth; Volition; Will; Conation\",\"oa_state\":2,\"link\":\"\",\"relevance\":104,\"cluster_labels\":\"Untuk meningkatkan, Model pembelajaran, Perangkat pembelajaran berbasis\",\"x\":\"0.367704934277866\",\"y\":\"-0.110858807798214\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Untuk meningkatkan, Model pembelajaran, Perangkat pembelajaran berbasis\"},{\"id\":\"oai:doaj.org\\/article:b5a56c1efd564effa55055f929282203\",\"title\":\"FAKTOR-FAKTOR YANG MEMPENGARUHI PENDIDIKAN KARAKTER HOLISTIK SISWA SMKN DI KOTA MALANG\",\"title_en\":\"FAKTOR-FAKTOR YANG MEMPENGARUHI PENDIDIKAN KARAKTER HOLISTIK SISWA SMKN DI KOTA MALANG\",\"authors\":\"Dianna Ratnawati\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Facing the challenge of MEA, we require to filter for protecting the foreign cultures that are not the same with the culture of our nation, one of the solutions is a holistic character education.

The Ministry of Higher Education has taken some steps to ensure that soft skills be addressed in the curriculum because they are among the essential skills needed by graduates in order to be employable in this global era. The issue of unemployment among graduates is associated with the notion that graduates have not adequately acquired employability skills and soft skills during their studies at university. In Malaysia, many employers have often complained that most Malaysian graduates lack the necessary soft skills vital for work. This has aroused concern among many parties which has led to the development of the Framework on Incorporating Soft Skills in Teaching and Learning in Malaysian Higher Education Institutions. It is one of the efforts undertaken to enhance the employability of university graduates through the inculcation of soft skills in higher education.
