This is primarily related to the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between subjectivity and psychic reality. The introduction of psychic reality as the decisive factor in the emergence of pathology and relativization of real reality enabled psychoanalysis to shift the focus from the real, external, objective, and physical to the unconscious fantasies, by which the inner world got its rightful place in the construction of 'mental'. Although psychological reality is located in the unconscious as well, Freud did not intend to declare the whole experience as purely subjective, but he thought that experience reflects unconscious influences, more precisely, unconscious desires and fantasies. Since all forms of knowledge are subjective, therefore, subject to the influence of the unconscious, it seems that psychic reality and subjectivity reflect unconscious influences to varying degrees, i.e. they show varying degrees of objectivity. This is corroborated by conscious states such as guilt and anxiety, which are such only because they are the result of unconscious dynamics triggered by the transfer, switched to an objective situation. It is not debatable that the sensory data as perceptual knowledge of external objects have a greater degree of objectivity than pure fantasies which are largely subjective and are very little based on the objective. Stressing the importance of the psychological reality both for the structure and for the psychology that seeks to understand the same structure, we will stress the ubiquity of that reality based on the ability of an infant to form primitive object relations in reality and in fantasy from the very beginning of life. Already, at the very beginning of life, a child finds himself in a vicious circle where the real experiences inevitably influence the unconscious fantasy, and then the fantasy affects the reality.

The article shows how in the 1920s Losev developed a new, sociological, vision, the belief that every being (physical, physiological, psychological and naturalistically-causally-sociological, etc.) \\u201cis, in comparison with social existence, a pure abstraction\\u201d, and this does not lead to the rejection of \\u201cmaterialistic idealism\\u201d and \\u201cabsolute mythology\\u201d. This sociological stand promotes the description of \\u201crelative mythologies\\u201d (collective psychology, social \\u201cmyths\\u201d). In the 1930s\\u20141940s, knowledge gained in the walls of the Institute of Psychology as well as Losev\\u2019s habit of self-observation and reflection about his own experiences contributed to the writing of psychological musical-philosophical prose, where Losev conceptualizes problems also addressed in his \\u201coctateuch\\u201d of the late 1920s.\",\"published_in\":\"Moscow State University of Psychology and Education\",\"year\":\"2018-11-01\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/8c79934ee2424ac0b8849a4c5887d2d2\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"A.F.

RESEARCH DESIGN, APPROACH AND METHOD: A cross-sectional survey design was used and the SATS36 was administered to a sample of convenience consisting of 235 students enrolled in Industrial and Organisational Psychology at a large tertiary institution in South Africa. MAIN FINDINGS: Results revealed that even though students perceive statistics to be technical, complicated and difficult to master, they are interested in the subject and believe statistics to be of value. The degree to which students perceived themselves to be competent in mathematics was related to the degree to which they felt confident in their own ability to master statistics. Males displayed slightly more positive feelings toward statistics than females. Older students perceived statistics to be less difficult than younger students and also displayed slightly more positive feelings concerning statistics. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: It seems that in preparing students for statistics, their perception regarding their mathematical competence could be managed as well. CONTRIBUTION: This study provides the first preliminary evidence for the reliability and validity of the SATS-36 for a sample of South African students.\",\"paper_abstract_en\":\"ORIENTATION: The attitude of students toward statistics may influence their enrolment, achievement and motivation in the subject of research and Industrial Psychology.

In addition to positive spiritual attitudes and emotions, Islamic spirituality emphasizes the positive religious manners such as prayer, observance of privacy of the non-intimate, and attention to responsibilities. These rituals and moral considerations have a decisive role in spiritual growth. For downloading the full-text of this article please click here. Please cite this article as: Farhoush M.

Nowadays, the traditional course of public psychology in college only focuses on the prevention and correction of psychological problems among college students, but educators ignore the importance of teaching students to understand psychological problems through relevant courses, making it impossible to achieve the expected effect of mental health education for students.

Nowadays, the traditional course of public psychology in college only focuses on the prevention and correction of psychological problems among college students, but educators ignore the importance of teaching students to understand psychological problems through relevant courses, making it impossible to achieve the expected effect of mental health education for students. Colleges should apply the notion of positive mental health education in the course of public psychology designed for college students.

Methods \\u2013 Researchers analyzed the bibliographies of doctoral dissertations from three academic departments at UCB: education (2009-2010), psychology (2009-2010), and social welfare (2009-2011). The sampling methodology used a systematic sample with a random start. To achieve a 95% (+\\/-4%) confidence interval, the sample included a total of 3,372 citations from 107 dissertations. Researchers consulted with a statistician to determine the statistical significance of the results. The test for the age of citation used a signed ranks test, which is typical for ordinal data or skewed interval data. The test for ownership was a chi-square test, which is typical for nominal data or dichotomous data. Results \\u2013 Researchers determined that a very high percentage of the cited journals were owned or licensed by the Library. The ownership rate for cited journals was 97% for both education and social welfare, and 99% for psychology. There was a statistically significant difference between the three disciplines, with psychology better supported than either education (p=.02) or social welfare (p=.01). However, since ownership rates for journals in all three disciplines were extremely high, this was not a meaningful difference. For books, the researchers found a significantly smaller percentage of books owned in social welfare compared to either education (p=.00) or psychology (p=.00). We found no significant difference between the percentages of books owned in psychology versus education (p=.27). Psychology students cited the highest percentage of journals while education students cited the highest percentage of books. Psychology students cited almost no free web resources, but education and social welfare students did cite free web resources (primarily government documents, working papers, or non-governmental organization reports). All three disciplines cited older material than anticipated.

Results \\u2013 Researchers determined that a very high percentage of the cited journals were owned or licensed by the Library. The ownership rate for cited journals was 97% for both education and social welfare, and 99% for psychology. There was a statistically significant difference between the three disciplines, with psychology better supported than either education (p=.02) or social welfare (p=.01). However, since ownership rates for journals in all three disciplines were extremely high, this was not a meaningful difference. For books, the researchers found a significantly smaller percentage of books owned in social welfare compared to either education (p=.00) or psychology (p=.00). We found no significant difference between the percentages of books owned in psychology versus education (p=.27). Psychology students cited the highest percentage of journals while education students cited the highest percentage of books. Psychology students cited almost no free web resources, but education and social welfare students did cite free web resources (primarily government documents, working papers, or non-governmental organization reports). All three disciplines cited older material than anticipated. Conclusions \\u2013 The citation analysis, while time-consuming, provided new and important information about the use of the Library\\u2019s collections and the level of support the collections afford doctoral students in the three related disciplines of education, psychology and social welfare. This data has informed collections-related decisions including format purchases and fund allocations.\",\"published_in\":\"University of Alberta\",\"year\":\"2014-06-01\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6d4bc7ddcd8b4f0ab6e05cce3ad7dfac\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"academic librarianship; collection development; doctoral students; user behavior; citation analysis; education; Bibliography.

Jung, owing to which he achieved the results. He was able to deeply and thoroughly comprehend the studied psychological phenomenon: the unconscious and its components. This led him to conclusions far beyond the boundaries of psychology, in the sphere of philosophy and cultural studies. Using the principle of determinism, Jung discovered and analyzed psychological causal relationships. He showed that the interaction of culture and nature in man provides him with a movement towards gaining his integrity. At the same time, Jung identified and considered options for the interaction of nature and culture in man. Through the dialectics of subject and object, Jung defined his position in understanding of unconscious and attitude to the concept of Freud. Jung explained the process of interaction between consciousness and the unconscious using energetic approach which was popular in philosophy in the beginning of 20 century. This particular approach allows the scientist to conclude that every psychic phenomenon is a manifestation of human vitality and energy. Energy itself is neither destructive nor creative. Quality gives it value, giving direction to human life, as energy takes its course. Jung formulated the theme of human life and destiny, and examined it through the prism of the influence of the unconscious. Possession of the dialectical style of thinking allowed him to form his research methodology. He shows that, along with socialization, individualization is important for the individual, ensuring individuality and integrity.\",\"paper_abstract_en\":\"The article considers the role of philosophical concepts and philosophical ideas in the psychological works of C.

Through documentary research, the present study sought to investigate the contributions, modalities, and frequency with which this subject has been present in the titles of scientific productions of the most representative Psychology congresses in Brazil between the years of 2010 and 2016. In all, 25,768 scientific papers presented in the scientific programming of the 64 events available on online platforms were analyzed. The results show that only 0.59% (n = 154) of the Works found were related to the S\\/R theme. The subjects related to Social Psychology (n = 32) and Critical Reviews (n = 28) were the most frequent, followed by Developmental Psychology (n = 16), Theory\\/Theoretical Lines (n=16) and Health\\/Hospital Psychology (n = 15). The contributions of the Working Group on Psychology and Religion were also presented.

Attention is drawn to the fact that until now there are no scientifically grounded requirements for experts in the field of practical psychology, their training programs, a system of evaluation criteria, the content and form of an expert opinion, etc. It is concluded that the development of the methodology of practical psychology and expertise in it will allow an objective assessment of the activities of both the Service of Practical Psychology as a whole and the work of its individual specialists, ensure their training, further training and retraining, and determine the conformity of their work to the requirements of standards professional activity.\",\"published_in\":\"Moscow State University of Psychology and Education\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/69860be9606c42098b12d14269764216\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"methodology of practical psychology; \\\"Institute of Expertise\\\"; an expert in the field of practical psychology; the requirements for the examination procedure in practical psychology; standards of professional activity (professional standards); Education; L\",\"subject\":\"methodology of practical psychology; \\\"Institute of Expertise\\\"; an expert in the field of practical psychology; the requirements for the examination procedure in practical psychology; standards of professional activity (professional standards); Education; L\",\"concepts\":\"Attention; Flow (Psychology); Concentration (Psychology); Compliance; Compliant behavior; Education; Pedagogy; Children--Education; Human resource development; Youth--Education; Education, Primitive; Education of children; Schooling; Instruction; Students--Education; Experience; Grammar, Comparative and general--Context; Situation (Linguistics); Context (Linguistics); Individuality; Individuation; Individuals (Philosophy); Individuation (Philosophy); Particulars (Philosophy); Mind; Mental philosophy; Psychology; Science, Mental; Behavioral sciences; Volition; Will; Conation\",\"concepts_en\":\"Attention; Flow (Psychology); Concentration (Psychology); Compliance; Compliant behavior; Education; Pedagogy; Children--Education; Human resource development; Youth--Education; Education, Primitive; Education of children; Schooling; Instruction; Students--Education; Experience; Grammar, Comparative and general--Context; Situation (Linguistics); Context (Linguistics); Individuality; Individuation; Individuals (Philosophy); Individuation (Philosophy); Particulars (Philosophy); Mind; Mental philosophy; Psychology; Science, Mental; Behavioral sciences; Volition; Will; Conation\",\"oa_state\":2,\"link\":\"\",\"relevance\":614},{\"id\":\"10670\\/1.1dsq61\",\"title\":\"Psicolog\\u00eda social, \\u00bfuna disciplina cognitiva?\",\"title_en\":\"Psicolog\\u00eda social, \\u00bfuna disciplina cognitiva?\",\"authors\":\"M\\u00f3nica Mar\\u00eda Ocampo Cardona\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper reviews the notion of subject and society in cognitive science and social psychology to analyze the approaches and \\/ or distancing of the different aspects.

But did this influence spread as far as to give place to Freud\\u2019s revolutionary discovery of the psychoanalytical unconscious? We know that Sigmund Freud attended enthusiastically Brentano\\u2019s lectures between 1874 and 1876. Yet, since Brentano\\u2019s name is never mentioned in Freud\\u2019s later, properly psychoanalytical writings, there is a very convincing argument for stating that Brentano had no lasting influence on Freud. Furthermore, Freud\\u2019s theory of the unconscious doesn\\u2019t seem to continue, but rather to oppose Brentano\\u2019s psychological views. Yet, as it was shown lately by a number of philosophers there are reasons to believe that Brentano had a profound influence on Freud. An attentive analysis of Freud\\u2019s vocabulary as well as his arguments against \\u201cphilosophical\\u201d objections supports this point rather convincingly. However, Freud was not a philosopher and Brentano\\u2019s historical influence does not suffice to transform the Freudian unconscious in a philosophical concept. It is the purpose of this paper to sketch a way to make a philosophical use of Freud\\u2019s unconscious by reconstructing the dialogue between Brentano and Freud on a conceptual level. First, I will explain the differences between Brentano and Freud\\u2019s psychology. While Brentano and even the most original of his students thought the mind is entirely conscious, and they only called \\u201cunconscious\\u201d certain intermittences of this consciousness, Freud\\u2019s metapsychology rests on the supposition that the mind is primarily unconscious and it is consciousness that appears locally as a quality of certain mental events. In the second part of my paper I will show that this opposition is not as radical as it seems. Freud\\u2019s metapsychological supposition of an unconscious mind is not merely stated but proven by clinical facts. And these facts allow Freud to substitute a dynamic approach of the mental to a descriptive psychology of Brentanian inspiration: a mental state is only conscious because it becomes thus by passing from an unconscious to a conscious state. It is this change in the point of view that allows Freud to see mental events as processes rather than mere states. Thus, the results of Brentano\\u2019s descriptive psychology are not denied but rather completed by Freud\\u2019s dynamic theory of the unconscious. The purpose of this paper is thus to clarify not only Freud\\u2019s historical relation to Brentano, but also the relation of his metapsychology to Brentano\\u2019s descriptive psychology and to all psychology that takes Freud\\u2019s discovery of the unconscious seriously. Despite the explicit critique of the unconscious that we find in the Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint, I think that Freud never truly opposed Brentano. He rather took Brentano\\u2019s descriptive psychology a step further: he introduced a dynamic component to the analysis of the psyche that could throw light on the blind spots in Brentano\\u2019s psychology.\",\"paper_abstract_en\":\"Brentano\\u2019s views on psychology influenced the way philosophy was made at the beginning of the 20th century. But did this influence spread as far as to give place to Freud\\u2019s revolutionary discovery of the psychoanalytical unconscious? We know that Sigmund Freud attended enthusiastically Brentano\\u2019s lectures between 1874 and 1876. Yet, since Brentano\\u2019s name is never mentioned in Freud\\u2019s later, properly psychoanalytical writings, there is a very convincing argument for stating that Brentano had no lasting influence on Freud. Furthermore, Freud\\u2019s theory of the unconscious doesn\\u2019t seem to continue, but rather to oppose Brentano\\u2019s psychological views. Yet, as it was shown lately by a number of philosophers there are reasons to believe that Brentano had a profound influence on Freud. An attentive analysis of Freud\\u2019s vocabulary as well as his arguments against \\u201cphilosophical\\u201d objections supports this point rather convincingly. However, Freud was not a philosopher and Brentano\\u2019s historical influence does not suffice to transform the Freudian unconscious in a philosophical concept. It is the purpose of this paper to sketch a way to make a philosophical use of Freud\\u2019s unconscious by reconstructing the dialogue between Brentano and Freud on a conceptual level. First, I will explain the differences between Brentano and Freud\\u2019s psychology. While Brentano and even the most original of his students thought the mind is entirely conscious, and they only called \\u201cunconscious\\u201d certain intermittences of this consciousness, Freud\\u2019s metapsychology rests on the supposition that the mind is primarily unconscious and it is consciousness that appears locally as a quality of certain mental events. In the second part of my paper I will show that this opposition is not as radical as it seems. Freud\\u2019s metapsychological supposition of an unconscious mind is not merely stated but proven by clinical facts. And these facts allow Freud to substitute a dynamic approach of the mental to a descriptive psychology of Brentanian inspiration: a mental state is only conscious because it becomes thus by passing from an unconscious to a conscious state. It is this change in the point of view that allows Freud to see mental events as processes rather than mere states. Thus, the results of Brentano\\u2019s descriptive psychology are not denied but rather completed by Freud\\u2019s dynamic theory of the unconscious. The purpose of this paper is thus to clarify not only Freud\\u2019s historical relation to Brentano, but also the relation of his metapsychology to Brentano\\u2019s descriptive psychology and to all psychology that takes Freud\\u2019s discovery of the unconscious seriously. Despite the explicit critique of the unconscious that we find in the Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint, I think that Freud never truly opposed Brentano.

In linking these two vitalities, questions of relationship come to the fore in co-producing and constituting educational environments\",\"published_in\":\"Pontificia Universidad Cat\\u00f3lica de Valpara\\u00edso, Escuela de Psicolog\\u00eda\",\"year\":\"2016-01-01\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/scielo.conicyt.cl\\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0718-69242016000100004\",\"readers\":0,\"subject_orig\":\"education; story; affect; psychoanalysis; actor network theory\",\"subject\":\"education; story; affect; psychoanalysis; actor network theory\",\"concepts\":\"Agency (Philosophy); Agents; Agent (Philosophy); Person (Philosophy); Human emotions; Passions; Feelings; Emotions; Illiteracy; Literacy; Learning; Learning process; Ontology; Being; Psychology; Behavioral sciences; Mind; Mental philosophy; Science, Mental\",\"concepts_en\":\"Agency (Philosophy); Agents; Agent (Philosophy); Person (Philosophy); Human emotions; Passions; Feelings; Emotions; Illiteracy; Literacy; Learning; Learning process; Ontology; Being; Psychology; Behavioral sciences; Mind; Mental philosophy; Science, Mental\",\"oa_state\":2,\"link\":\"\",\"relevance\":816},{\"id\":\"oai:doaj.org\\/article:d27ef80dcaea496696e9b6f7c75538f9\",\"title\":\"Special Psychology and Pedagogy in the Modern School.\",\"title_en\":\"Special Psychology and Pedagogy in the Modern School.\",\"authors\":\"Lubovsky D.
