[Note - also available on YouTube at: http:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=gDwMEqhuab0] [The University of British Columbia opened on 22 September 1915 in facilities previously occupied by McGill University College of British Columbia in the Fairview area of Vancouver, on the site of what is now Vancouver General Hospital. Although a site commission had, several years earlier, selected Point Grey as the location for the new university, the outbreak of World War I in 1914 halted development of the site following the initial clearing of the land and some preliminary construction. Overcrowded lecture halls and inadequate laboratory facilities characterized the University's early years at Fairview. Additional space had to be found as the number of students grew. Professors held agricultural classes in a private residence, French classes in the basement of a church unused by its congregation during the week, and chemistry classes in the famous chemistry tent erected on the site. Students and faculty alike viewed the \\\"shacks\\\" at Fairview as a temporary inconvenience and looked forward to what they felt would be an imminent move to the new campus. Unfortunately, the inadequate Fairview facilities would serve as home to the University for its first full decade of existence. As the number of students attending UBC expanded, the frustration with government inaction on the construction of a new university campus also grew so much so that the students decided to take action. Planning for the student campaign began in earnest in the spring of 1922 under the leadership of returned war veteran and AMS president-elect Ab Richards.As a first step in what would become a massive and well-organized \\\"Build the University Campaign\\\", students were asked to take petitions back to their hometowns in the summer and each collect at least 25 signatures petitioning the government to resume construction of the Point Grey campus. Having collected some 17,000 signatures during the summer break, students upon their return to Vancouver in the fall embarked on a promotional campaign and massive canvas of the city to collect additional names. At the conclusion of the organized petition blitz, the students had collected approximately 56,000 signatures. The students utilized \\\"Varsity Week\\\" (October 22nd-28th) to raise public awareness about the plight of the young institution. Varsity Week activities culminated in the \\\"Pilgrimage\\\" (the term \\\"Great Trek\\\" would be coined some 25 years later) on Saturday, October 28, 1922. Nearly 1,200 students with banners and placards, floats, and a marching band made their way through downtown Vancouver and boarded electric streetcar at Granville and Davie which transported them to 10th Ave. and Sasamat in Point Grey. From there they marched on what was little more than a wagon road, to the UBC campus site and gathered beside the eight-year-old concrete and steel framework of the Science building and then climbed into the unfinished structure. That early student \\\"sit-in\\\" and subsequent Trek participants' formation of the human \\\"UBC\\\" helped lay symbolic claim to the unfinished Point Grey campus. The pilgrimage ended with the dedication of the cairn that still stands on campus (lower right). Commissioned by the students before the \\\"Great Trek\\\" it was fittingly the first structure to be completed on the new campus. Ab Richards expressed the hope that \\\"very soon around our cairn of rocks buildings will rise and a university will bring honour and glory to our Alma Mater and renown to our Province and Dominion.\\\" In the week following the pilgrimage, the students presented a 56,000-name petition to members of the B.C. Legislature in Victoria. The impressive petition, persuasive presentation and obvious public support convinced the government to resume work on the Point Grey campus, and on September 22, 1925 students crowded into a crowded auditorium for the first inaugural general assembly on the new campus. Student organization of the Great Trek and the entire publicity campaign represents a remarkable, but not isolated, chapter in UBC's history. Subsequent student initiatives led to the construction of several campus buildings including the Gymnasium (1929), Brock Hall (1940), Armoury (1941), War Memorial Gymnasium (1951) and the Student Union Building (1968). Although perhaps not on the scale of the Great Trek, these initiatives too, helped define the University.] ; Library, UBC ; Unreviewed ; Faculty\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2008\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"the great; great trek\",\"authors\":\"Hives, Christopher\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2429\\/31778\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"21d2b7ec3eb6da58b79d726d737e41ddba548be039694e3379098ef9ea5b2bd2\",\"relevance\":91,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Great Trek, University of British Columbia - history\",\"x\":\"0.212363004988261\",\"y\":\"2.73288870213276\",\"labels\":\"21d2b7ec3eb6da58b79d726d737e41ddba548be039694e3379098ef9ea5b2bd2\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Great Trek, University of British Columbia - history\"},{\"id\":\"21edfd89d535b3ae315993ce21f81ef24669e9acdc87405147fa7d7da67dc06a\",\"relation\":\"Sustainable Futures Speaker Series;; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10211.3\\/128344\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10211.3\\/128344\",\"title\":\"A Portfolio Approach to Sustainable Transportation\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Lecture delivered at Humboldt State University on October 9, 2014 by Joan Ogden. Part of the Sustainable futures speaker series sponsored by the Schatz Energy Research Center and the Environment and Community Program. ; Dr. Joan Ogden is Professor of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California, Davis and Director of the Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways Program at the campus???s Institute of Transportation Studies. Her primary research interest is technical and economic assessment of new energy technologies, especially in the areas of alternative fuels, fuel cells, renewable energy and energy conservation. Her recent work centers on the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier, hydrogen infrastructure strategies, and applications of fuel cell technology in transportation and stationary power production. She has served on California state committees on hydrogen and greenhouse gas issues, the USDOE Hydrogen Technical Advisory Committee, the IPCC panel on Renewable Energy, and on National Academies committees assessing hydrogen fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles. She holds a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Illinois, and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University of Maryland. Making a transition to a sustainable transportation system requires fast-moving success on three fronts: improved energy efficiency, reduced travel demand, and adoption of low carbon fuels that can be produced from widely available primary sources. There are technical options for moving closer to each of these goals, including adoption of alternative fuels such as electricity, biofuels, hydrogen. By combining these approaches, recent studies suggest it would be technically feasible to significantly reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and diversify away from dependence on petroleum over the next few decades. But actual progress towards these goals has been slower than the technical potential suggests, because of an array of complex transition issues. In this talk, Ogden will examine the options for meeting sustainability and energy security goals in the transport sector, and discuss barriers to their implementation.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-10-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"a portfolio; approach sustainable; portfolio approach\",\"authors\":\"Ogden, Joan\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10211.3\\/128344\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"21edfd89d535b3ae315993ce21f81ef24669e9acdc87405147fa7d7da67dc06a\",\"relevance\":96,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Indoor cannabis production, Portfolio approach, Alternative liquid fuels\",\"x\":\"1.53258767421503\",\"y\":\"3.09076550921016\",\"labels\":\"21edfd89d535b3ae315993ce21f81ef24669e9acdc87405147fa7d7da67dc06a\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Indoor cannabis production, Portfolio approach, Alternative liquid fuels\"},{\"id\":\"23e1bd253fb00cdde6c6ee519eafb2575999f97a4134a64f4d7db72ca217854c\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.0864\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.0864\",\"title\":\"Exchange of mail at rural P.O., U.S.P.O. \\/\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\\"The opening scene shows a yard in front of what seems to be a two-story house.

The genetic basis of commercially used Arabica coffee cultivars is extremely narrow, and it is uncertain how much genetic diversity is present in ex situ collections. Conserving the wild Arabica coffee gene pool and its evolutionary potential present in the montane forests of SW Ethiopia is thus critically important for maintaining coffee yield and yield stability worldwide. Globally, coffee agroforestry helps to conserve forest cover and forest biodiversity that cannot persist in open agricultural landscapes, but the conservation of the wild Arabica coffee gene pool requires other priorities than those that are usually set for conserving forest biodiversity in mixed tropical landscapes. We show how forest loss and degradation, coffee management, in particular production intensification, and the introduction of cultivars, are threatening the genetic integrity of these wild populations. We propose an active land sparing approach based on strict land use zoning to conserve the genetic resources and the in situ evolutionary potential of Arabica coffee and discuss the major challenges including the development of access and benefit sharing mechanisms for ensuring long-term support to conservation. ; status: published\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"Agricultural intensification; Agroforest; Coffea arabica; Crop wild relative; Ethiopia; Genetic resources\",\"subject\":\"Agricultural intensification; Agroforest; Coffea arabica; Crop wild relative; Ethiopia; Genetic resources\",\"authors\":\"Aerts, Raf; Geeraert, Lore; Berecha, G; Hundera, K; Muys, Bart; De Kort, Hanne; Honnay, Olivier\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/561080\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"354c0425f6267a14ee7c9925376b2bca519cbb0cfb646439a4f2cd25e1b54b90\",\"relevance\":69,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\",\"Report\",\"Map\",\"Still image\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Golden age hip-hop, Analyses supporting, Carnivores healthy\",\"x\":\"2.21377867011454\",\"y\":\"1.73698627670217\",\"labels\":\"354c0425f6267a14ee7c9925376b2bca519cbb0cfb646439a4f2cd25e1b54b90\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Golden age hip-hop, Analyses supporting, Carnivores healthy\"},{\"id\":\"374f99f625bbc2ec61f8168713c7f1718944720ee175d3cc84da4981afeef3a2\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.1878\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.1878\",\"title\":\"Street mail car, U.S.P.O. \\/\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\\"The first scene appears to have been taken on a main thoroughfare of large city.

The model is designed to evaluate the economics of deficit irrigation (irrigation at less than the amount required to produce maximum yield). The spreadsheet first models the water production function for a crop, then uses that relationship along with crop price and production costs to calculate net income and the irrigation amount that maximizes net income. This spreadsheet is similar to another posted at Ag Data Commons: \\\"Economic Model of Deficit Irrigation\\\" (http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.15482\\/USDA.ADC\\/1504421). That model was designed primarily to evaluate deficit irrigation as a means to compare revenue with reduced water consumption to income gained by transferring the saved water. The model includes two common scenarios: 1) irrigation water supply is adequate but expensive, and 2) irrigation water supply is inadequate to fully irrigate the available land. In the first scenario, net income is maximized when the marginal costs of production, including water, is equal to the marginal revenue. In the second scenario, net income is maximized when the value of the water is maximized by selecting the portion of the land that should be irrigated. In the second scenario, the value and costs of the un-irrigated land are included. The first worksheet of the spreadsheet describes the relationships used in each worksheet and the input parameters required. Additional worksheets calculate the water production function, the irrigation water production function, and the net income for each of the two scenarios. The worksheets allow the user to input the various biophysical and economic parameters relevant to their conditions and allows evaluating various parameter combinations.

The program includes both the wine production facilities and the hospitality facilities for visitors. The driving concept of the project is to merge those two, often opposing, programmatic elements.

This emissions-free source of electricity is extremely beneficial to the war on carbon and global climate change. At the same time, we know wind power facilities can adversely effect the surrounding environment. Turbines can kill birds and bats through blade strike, and the presence of large turbines can visually pollute previously pristine vistas. While the population level effects of turbine-caused fatalities is unknown for both birds and bats, turbine-caused deaths should be reduced as far as economically feasible. Toward that end, mortality reduction measures are common at wind generation facilities. Mitigation of endangered species' deaths is a requirement for endangered species take permits under the federal Endangered Species Act. This talk is about three things. First, how we study bird and bat mortality at wind power generation facilities. The science behind finding carcasses under turbines and adjusting for ones we do not find is deceptively complex. Second, what we have learned about wind fatalities over the course of three decades. We can now quantify the mortality of some species, and we have learned strategies for reducing the mortality of some species, but quick omnibus solutions are frustratingly elusive. Lastly, where research in wind and wildlife interactions is going over the next decade. Advanced technologies, in the form of cameras, vibration sensors, hypersonic sound emitters, and beagles are exciting developments in the study of wind power and wildlife interactions. It is my hope that audience members come away with a better understanding of commercial wind power production, its effects on wildlife, and the science behind these studies.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-03-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"how we; are going; know where\",\"authors\":\"McDonald, Dr. Trent\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10211.3\\/215876\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"550c9539abb8cda32ac13be1c807b74d26c1f0fb73099d2d1035a47a1af5a5a0\",\"relevance\":103,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Golden age hip-hop, Analyses supporting, Carnivores healthy\",\"x\":\"1.77228881897924\",\"y\":\"3.00296763760887\",\"labels\":\"550c9539abb8cda32ac13be1c807b74d26c1f0fb73099d2d1035a47a1af5a5a0\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Golden age hip-hop, Analyses supporting, Carnivores healthy\"},{\"id\":\"592f6577ac5e9e7b048bf2f42a7b8e91195a1a6e62d88280827eaa9c6ef4e2ab\",\"relation\":\"2013 Algae Biotreatment Symposium; https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/playlist?list=PLBCBPVHKoeNcLOTOziWjO8JmWgTKUZKWL; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/o1mEraJ-xW4; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/1HAYUlNDvmQ; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/N0dyLMqsz-A; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/XP59L9K5oSE; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/nNutIvqP2to; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2142\\/106972\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2142\\/106972; https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/playlist?list=PLBCBPVHKoeNcLOTOziWjO8JmWgTKUZKWL; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/o1mEraJ-xW4; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/1HAYUlNDvmQ; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/N0dyLMqsz-A; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/XP59L9K5oSE; https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/nNutIvqP2to\",\"title\":\"Algae Biotreatment Symposium\",\"paper_abstract\":\"ISTC held a mini-symposium in October 2013 on the role of algae in future commercial applications for food, feed, bio-based materials, and bioenergy.

Household farm decision-making is often examined as an individual or a jointly made choice, both frequently described as empowering in quantitative studies as women participate in agricultural decisions. However, empowerment is contextual and often difficult to measure and, thus, a qualitative methodology (focus groups and interviews) can better illuminate how joint decision-making processes occur to investigate womens empowerment. This research asks: how is decision-making among Indigenous women influenced by their gender when producing quinoa in rural Ecuador? The findings include a feminization of agriculture among the participants, in which Indigenous women have become in charge of quinoa production, a traditionally male-dominated crop, due to Indigenous mens absence in the farm. Furthermore, the participants described decision-making as jointly made, but men had greater authority, which was influenced by their religious beliefs, and men often made final decisions even when they had little or no participation in the farm work. Overall, womens participation in quinoa production increased, but because the participants associated men as heads of household, womens decision-making power was still limited even as they have become principal farmers. This study contributes to the literature of decision-making and demonstrates the importance of contextual characteristics, such as the feminization of agriculture, that influence decision-making processes. Overall, Indigenous women farmers are limited by patriarchal norms in their decision-making opportunities and overall empowerment. ; Outreach and International Affairs (OIA)\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021-09-16\",\"subject_orig\":\"Women; Ecuador; Quinoa; Gender and decision making\",\"subject\":\"Women; Ecuador; Quinoa; Gender and decision making\",\"authors\":\"C\\u00e1rdenas, Elisa\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10919\\/105138\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5955511509dbef785a8f76946e362ad9f4a08d0a8cf829379905b7a98345e504\",\"relevance\":44,\"resulttype\":[\"Conference object\",\"Still image\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Discourse, Conversation, Undetermined language\",\"x\":\"2.79768636105537\",\"y\":\"-1.87287240847464\",\"labels\":\"5955511509dbef785a8f76946e362ad9f4a08d0a8cf829379905b7a98345e504\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Discourse, Conversation, Undetermined language\"},{\"id\":\"59b1285735c61dabb5897fb62dd3d0af21f57ec968bf1c1d635f75619cda7118\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.1863\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.1863\",\"title\":\"Shooting the Chutes, Luna Park, Coney Island \\/\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\\"The camera was positioned to view the Shoot-the-Chutes concession from the best location.

However, regional food shortages, diseases, war, and water shortages have tended to limit population increases, and the efficiency of food production in developed countries has improved greatly particularly over the last 50 years. Nevertheless, during the last half-century the global population has more than doubled from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 6 billion in October 2000. Forecasts of future global human populations have ranged from 7.7 billion to 13 billion by 2050. Enormous increases of energy, food and water supplies are absolutely essential to support such expanded populations. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas are finite resources, and the availability of oil and oil-based chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, will peak by 2010 and will be exhausted, or prohibitively expensive, by 2050. Known sources of renewable energy such as nuclear, solar, wind, and water power systems have the potential to supply only 20-30% of our current energy needs. Since 1980 the per capita production of food has been decreasing progressively due to: loss of land; soil erosion and exhaustion; deforestation; and urbanization. Fresh water supplies are decreasing globally and agriculture consumes more than 93% of the available water for irrigation. Additionally, gaseous emissions have been predicted to raise global temperatures by as much as 10\\u00a1C in the next 100 years, with the potential for drastic effects on agricultural production. Even if innovative renewable energy technologies are developed; the losses of productive soils retarded; biological alternatives to energy-based chemicals discovered; new sources of fresh water found; and climatic changes slowed; the world population cannot continue to increase at its current rates. We may already be close to peak human populations, which may have to stabilize in the long term at 2-3 billion, unless there are enormous technological developments in food production and environmental conservation. ; Introduction by Ed Ray, Executive Vice-President and Provost of The Ohio State University (00:00:00-00:04:15) -- Presentation (00:04:16-00:55:45) -- Questions (00:55:46-1:10:52)\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2001-10-17\",\"subject_orig\":\"People with disabilities -- Legal status; laws; etc. -- United States; People with disabilities -- Services for -- United States\",\"subject\":\"People with disabilities; Legal status; laws;; ; United States; People with disabilities; Services for; United States\",\"authors\":\"Colker, Ruth\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1811\\/31757\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"69ed4b1767e774bc91d9bcd17f5012645b35c03ba6bf8b32a92e123e8c44aaea\",\"relevance\":34,\"resulttype\":[\"Conference object\",\"Still image\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Populations energy food, 21st century, Food water\",\"x\":\"1.61830973208659\",\"y\":\"1.74572117827406\",\"labels\":\"69ed4b1767e774bc91d9bcd17f5012645b35c03ba6bf8b32a92e123e8c44aaea\",\"area_uri\":12,\"area\":\"Populations energy food, 21st century, Food water\"},{\"id\":\"6cd97c8ec39eea04c75dfd81354a5be7996886ac64ede4c5f1deaa2953515b54\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/lat1.lis.soas.ac.uk\\/ds\\/asv?openpath=MPI1164004%23\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/lat1.lis.soas.ac.uk\\/ds\\/asv?openpath=MPI1164004%23\",\"title\":\"JBG009\",\"paper_abstract\":\"second \\\"fire-recording\\\": JBG (Golpa speaker) describes\\/narrates how to make a fire by describing\\/using a photo series.

The processing of these recordings will reveal and document linguistic and cultural knowledge about a dying Australian indigenous group and make it accessible to the community as well as to researchers. This project is the first attempt to document and describe the Golpa language (and culture). ; JBG narrates how to make a fire by describing\\/using a photo series. ; Muthali is the last fluent speaker of Golpa. ; JKL has been in touch with the Golpa since 2008 via phone. They first met and worked together in 2009, then again in 2011 and 2012. She has spent a total of approx. 5 months in the field. JKL has carried out all field trips together with her little son (which resulted in wonderful social contacts with the locals and more natural work sessions). ; JKL obtained the photos that were the subject of this recording from LPC in 2011. ; JKL obtained the photos that were the subject of this recording from LPC in 2011.

The typical convent climate of modesty, isolation and self-abnegation had a fundamental impact on the production, preservation and accessibility of archives and historical data. Biographical information about individual members of orders and congregations in particular was difficult to acquire and to collect, seriously hindering sociologists and historians in developing scientifically based statistical, prosopographic or in-depth analyses of convent life. Consequently, the important phenomenon of the religious revival that manifested itself after the French Revolution in Belgium \\u2013 as elsewhere in Western Europe \\u2013 was rarely examined from a general, quantifying perspective. With approximately 50,000 female and over 10,000 male religious by the middle of the twentieth century, members of orders and congregations in Belgium represented a large social group and, considering their important impact on different societal domains (pastoral work, education, care, social provisions, \\u2026), an interesting topic for research. Moreover, the post-revolutionary convent world offers fascinating gender patterns to examine. Not only did religious women vastly outnumber religious men; analyzing male and female convent worlds may also unveil differences in social, professional and clerical position. As part of its mission to preserve convent heritage and to foster research on the world of religious institutes, KADOC-KULeuven has focused intensively on collecting archives and data on male and female religious, on a collective as well as on an individual level. In the last two decades, KADOC gradually built and implemented online instruments that allow researchers to (re-)use the many different contextual (meta)data-sets that the Center has gathered over the last decades. Some of them were newly created during research and heritage projects. Others are based on older (analogue) repertories, archives and corpora that were digitized, structured according to international standards, updated and brought online. KADOC\\u2019s main data-sets on religious institutes are stored and managed in the web-database ODIS (www.odis.be), created in 2000-2003. ODIS applies repeatable field groups and directional input, systematized by means of validated vocabularies and thesauri. Its relational field groups allow for the creation clear and univocal links between records. As a result, rich and consistent data-packages are created that create new possibilities for research. With regard to religious institutes, ODIS contains records with general information and sources about nearly 250 religious institutes, linked to records about their archives, their related organizations and institutes and their members. Records of individual female and male religious contain systematized information about their social and geographical descent, their age of entry and profession, their career within the convent, their apostolic commitments etc. This contribution focusses on the potential and limitations of the ODIS-data sets concerning religious institutes and their members, with special interest for issues of gender. The first research question is on the gender mechanisms of the revival. To what extent can the possible entanglement between male and female convent foundations, the role of male religious in female institutes, the gendered collaboration and interactions on the diverse apostolic fields and much more be examined through an analyses of the ODIS datasets? Second, we examine the potential for discerning parallels and differences between and among groups of female and male religious, for example with regard to their descent, entry, religious career and life expectancy. Third, we focus on the possibilities to quantify and qualify the international significance of Belgian male and female religious with regard to missionary activities.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"article; Film; ddc:940; Digital humanities -- Gender -- Gender history -- Geschlechtergeschichte -- Geschlecht -- Geschichte -- Tagung -- Conference -- Religion -- Mission --\",\"subject\":\"article; Film; Digital humanities; Gender; Gender history; Geschlechtergeschichte; Geschlecht; Geschichte; Tagung; Conference; Religion; Mission --\",\"authors\":\"Suenens, Kristien\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22032\\/dbt.49175\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"79045239d262788e65e77318ccf8fc68aea288a2e31c14b832a20e8335226cb5\",\"relevance\":92,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22032\\/dbt.49175\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Indoor cannabis production, Portfolio approach, Alternative liquid fuels\",\"x\":\"-0.275710285655414\",\"y\":\"3.40207604202871\",\"labels\":\"79045239d262788e65e77318ccf8fc68aea288a2e31c14b832a20e8335226cb5\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Indoor cannabis production, Portfolio approach, Alternative liquid fuels\"},{\"id\":\"7948a8b0fad12d55565a3b777b9e32b1858ff16ccd5623551618bde79a429da9\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.0090\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.0090\",\"title\":\"Lathrop School, calisthenics \\/\",\"paper_abstract\":\"A group of preadolescent boys and girls is standing in a row facing the camera position.

It analyses the democratization of local government through the creation of new electoral circumscriptions, which aim to facilitate public participation: the wards. The study focuses on ward 44, which brings together territories formerly divided by apartheid. The immersion in the daily lives of various families highlights the mechanisms of a community-based governmentality, where individual political legitimacy is intertwined with the shared experience of the city.The PhD comes with a DVD comprising sixteen video excerpts of life narratives, scenes of daily life and neighbourhood events. The pragmatic tactics that urban residents deploy on a daily basis thus reveal their full complexity. They not only adjust to on-going institutional reforms, they also condition the very implementation of these reforms.

I have to check this, which then would be identical with woman001. ; We established that he was about 15 years old when Sekou Tour\\u00e9 took power (his fourth young brother was born then), which puts his age at around 73. He is the Imam that preaches at Difiare. He got his title of Fode at Boffa. He has been Imam 17 years at Difiare, before that he had been Imam at Bitonko for about 3 years. He leads (with p051) the Koranic School at Bitonko with currently about 10 students. Even though they run the school together, the students are divided between them. The 10 are the students attributed to his household. p051 was his student. He took over from his father 2 or three years before Sekou Tour\\u00e9 died. He played soccer, but was never paid for it. He is not part of a S\\u00e9r\\u00e9 but of the Islamic League. He is not initiated. He does not remember the last initiation, the religious center was apparantly at Dobali. He claims that nothing was done at Bitonko. He does not move around much, but if he goes he goes to Bok\\u00e9, Kamsar, Kanfarand\\u00e9 for personal affiairs. He lived 3 years at Difiare. ; He says that he was born during the second year after the opening of the military camp in 1972 (as given by p031) close to Bitonko. He goes to Kamsar maybe five times during a year to stay for a week or a month. He also goes to Conakry, or Guinea-Bissau to sell some of his produce. ; He is p002 of the Nalu project deposit at ELAR (deposit: 0249). See description and notes there. ; He says he is 40 years old. This is a good estimate given that he says that he did not have any children but was already married dwhen Lansana Cont\\u00e9 took power. Although I would add 10 years, because of that. He is part of the S\\u00e8r\\u00e8 \\\"Group Kalala\\\". For mutual support or help the village, if financial need arrives. He has been a member for 3 years. He is not initiated. According to him e does not move around very much. He sometimes goes to Bok\\u00e9 or Kolaboui, because some of his children go to school there. ; He said that he is 35 years old, but then we established that it was long before Lansana Cont\\u00e9 took power that he was born. He already had 2 children at that time. He also said that he was born durng the reign of Sekou Tour\\u00e9 By estimating that he was about 22 years old at that time, we arrive at an age of 54. He studied to be a mason and builder with a local mason at Dobali. He says that he has been doing this for 8 years. He is not a member of a S\\u00e8r\\u00e8. He is not initiated. He does not move around very often and goes to Kamsar maybe once a year, he says. He says he moves around in the immediate region around Dobali. ; He is part of the S\\u00e8r\\u00e8, that is he just founded a S\\u00e8r\\u00e8 with about 25 or 30 people, that does not have a name yet. The S\\u00e8r\\u00e8 is for mutual support. He is the leader of the S\\u00e8r\\u00e8. He also part of another association that does not have a name, it is also for mutual support. Nowadays he mostly stays at Kakrunt, and moves around to go to Kamsar, Bok\\u00e9, or Conakry. He can leave about 3-4 times to visit relatives in those places. ; We established that he was about had his first child around the time when Sekou Tour\\u00e9 took power, which makes me think he is around 65. He gave his age as 70 years. He stays mainly in Bitonko, but he can go for a short time to Kamsar, if necessary. He said that a family father can only leave for two reasons: sickness or the necessitsy to manage some personal affairs. For the latter one takes about 2-3 days, in the former case that can be of longer duration. ; As a note on the nickname in \\\"Nom de terrain\\\": Women are often identified by locality or family in my interviews. When asked interviewees did not provide nicknames as readily as men. The age is also unsure. As orientation she indicated that she was already married when Sekou Tour\\u00e9 took power. Let's say she was 20 in 1958, that would give an age around 76. She used to farm the most common crops of this area: grounduts, rice, millet, fonio. She says that in case of the groundnuts, it was her who cultivated them and then her husband went to sell them at the market. She says that she gets a little bit of money for her mid-wife services (this includes female excision). She is not part of a S\\u00e8r\\u00e8 at the moment. That is for younger people, but she used to be part of a S\\u00e9r\\u00e9, called \\/makissa\\/ for a few years. She said that she is not initiated. In the interview she used an interesting phrase (in translation from p002) Baga d'ici to differentiate from the other Baga people. She is the mother of p029 and lives with her second husband. Both husbands were Baga from Bitonko (Cherif Camara (Kandoma, near Kolaboui, is where he studied), Soriba Camara.) She is currently limited to Bitonko, but when her husband lived she often went to Kandoma. ; p026 spent a substantial part of his life outside the village. He says he worked in Conkary, Nz\\u00e9r\\u00e9kor\\u00e9, Koundara. He worked for TP (Travaux publiques) at first from 55' to 60', then he worked as a French Mining Company for '61 to 63', then he was a teacher at Nz\\u00e8r\\u00e8kor\\u00e8 until '66 (2 years at Nz\\u00e9\\u00e9kor\\u00e9, and 2 years at Bintonko), then he says he worked in a storage facility (Magazin g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale) for the state at Koundara (Commerce d'\\u00e9tat) for 6 years. After that he came back to stay in Bok\\u00e9 around 1975 (he says he did not work, and relied on his children ever since then), he only came back to live in the village 2 years ago. He says that his children work the fields for him (groundnuts, rice). He says it is for subsistence. He says that he once travelled to Senegal with goods that he had bought in Koundara to sell there. He never fished. He never was involved in Palm Oil production. He is not part of a S\\u00e8r\\u00e8. He says he has not been initiated here. ; He said that he is 80 years old. However, we established that he was born around the time when Sekou Tour\\u00e9 took power, which puts his age at around 55. In the interview he made an interesting comment claiming that his father only knew Baga, which is then countered by his claim that his father had married a Susu wife. His mother was from Boffa. He stays mostly in Bitonko during the year. He sometimes goes to Boke, Kamsar, Conakry, Fria to visit relatives. He moves around alot in the region (Kamsar and Boke, is where he sells his goods (groundnuts). Each month he leaves Bitonko maybe 2-3 times to move around in the region. He also goes to Bissau to visit relatives (he visits the capital and\\/or villages\\/cities close to the border). He says that there are no Baga villages in Bissau, but some familymembers went to reside with the Nalu and Balanta. ; This is the woman carrying the calabash to at the beginning of the video 20140329_wedding.mpg. There was no time to collect data on her. This will have to be done later. ; His name is Karim Camara and he appears in two clips related to the wedding ceremony recorded. I could not get his data or explicit consent recorded, because he lived in a village further away. It is interesting that he could not speak Baga Mandori, yet he is related to the family, as I was told.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-03-28\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"the bride; documentation baga; atlantic niger\",\"authors\":\"\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/lat1.lis.soas.ac.uk\\/ds\\/asv?openpath=MPI1033962%23\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"bc8556c1c812fb6907cae896e915b4244bd57de1ebbecae7b26bb32aa5c1723d\",\"relevance\":90,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Discourse, Conversation, Undetermined language\",\"x\":\"2.88446979065863\",\"y\":\"0.908233836434864\",\"labels\":\"bc8556c1c812fb6907cae896e915b4244bd57de1ebbecae7b26bb32aa5c1723d\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Discourse, Conversation, Undetermined language\"},{\"id\":\"bf9cb7063d4182d7d7e87d1f7983f1e821946c8fe64bf31c79a399466e8f872e\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.2212\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.2212\",\"title\":\"Swimming pool, Palm Beach \\/\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\\"The film, photographed from a single-camera position, shows a swimming pool with a white building on the far side.

Supporting data.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The timing and quantity of fruit production are major determinants of the functioning of a forest community, but both components are rarely taken into account simultaneously. We aimed at determining fruiting variability in timing and quantity in a rainforest community at two temporal scales: seasonal and inter-annual. We also examined whether dispersal type may influence fruiting variation. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian approach for analyzing a ten-year dataset (2001-2011) of fruit phenology (45 tree and liana species) from the Amazonian forest of Nouragues (French Guiana), with a 29% of censuses lacking. Regarding annual seasonality, the fruiting peak of 49% of species was reached during the peak of the rainy season, which is the most typical pattern of central and eastern Amazon. Most species varied across years in both timing and quantity of fruiting, although seed production showed larger changes. We did not find significant differences in inter-annual variation on fruiting according to the dispersal mode of species. Parameters extracted from the Bayesian models were helpful to classify species according to their degree of variability (low, medium and high) and to distinguish masting events (40% of species). Seed rain at the community level was dominated by 25% of species, which overwhelmingly had abiotic dispersal modes (80%). Our analytical method proved helpful to explore inter-annual variability of the large majority of species in the community, although showed a poor fit for two continuous species. It also allowed overcoming the analytical challenge of lacking censuses, which is a common problem in tropical monitoring. The combination of long-term monitoring of phenology with sophisticated statistical analyses is therefore key for a better understanding of temporal changes in fruiting phenology. Future development of our models will allow forecasting of fruit variation under new climatic conditions, which has critical consequences for depending consumers.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"dataset inter; analyses supporting; annual variability\",\"authors\":\"Mendoza, Irene; Condit, Richard S.; Wright, S.

This question is addressed through a statistically-driven corpus analysis of hip-hop music released during the genre's Golden Age era. The first part of the paper presents a methodology for developing, transcribing, and analyzing a corpus of 100 hip-hop tracks released during the Golden Age. Eight categories of aurally salient musical and production parameters are analyzed: tempo, orchestration and texture, harmony, form, vocal and lyric profiles, global and local production effects, vocal doubling and backing, and loudness and compression. The second part of the paper organizes the analysis data into three trend categories: trends of change (parameters that change over time), trends of prevalence (parameters that remain generally constant across the corpus), and trends of similarity (parameters that are similar from song to song). These trends form a generalized model of the Golden Age hip-hop sound which considers both global (the whole corpus) and local (unique songs within the corpus) contexts. By operationalizing \\\"sound\\\" as the sum of musical and production parameters, aspects of popular music that are resistant to traditional music-analytical methods can be considered.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"corpus study; sound; Golden Age hip-hop; music production; empirical musicology\",\"subject\":\"corpus study; sound; Golden Age hip-hop; music production; empirical musicology\",\"authors\":\"Duinker, Ben; Martin, Denis\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1811\\/81126\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d93bc1f681147ca2a3e9d3cc0cc650e507a289880bce3ea26d0354665d4eaacb\",\"relevance\":118,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Still image\",\"Dataset\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Golden age hip-hop, Analyses supporting, Carnivores healthy\",\"x\":\"1.05205486854205\",\"y\":\"2.24238846163552\",\"labels\":\"d93bc1f681147ca2a3e9d3cc0cc650e507a289880bce3ea26d0354665d4eaacb\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Golden age hip-hop, Analyses supporting, Carnivores healthy\"},{\"id\":\"d9885434614f2ded0bf94d1b0eb5323463e7075bc2ff41a05e022b02a9eba36c\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/edmp.1294\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/edmp.1294\",\"title\":\"English lancers charging \\/\",\"paper_abstract\":\"From Edison films catalog: The stubborn resistance of the Boers is shown by the activity and persistency with which they fire the two large field pieces immediately in the foreground.

The map shows the borders of the new republic with Circassia (the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus) in the north, Turkey and the Republic of Armenia in the south, and Azerbaijan in the southeast. Also shown are towns and villages, ports, railroads, and the ferries linking the Black Sea port of Batoum (present-day Batumi) to Odessa (present-day Ukraine) and Novorossiysk (present-day Russian Federation). Colors and shading are used to show the different agricultural regions in the country, which include pasturage, forested regions, regions of viniculture and orchards, areas of grain production, and areas of specialized cultivation. The latter (listed in the table at the lower left and identified by region) include a great variety of crops, for example, tobacco, tea, mulberries (for silk production), nuts, decorative plants, and several others. Symbols indicate mines and quarries producing minerals of different types, including copper, lead, zinc, antimony, iron, gold, coal, naphtha, and other products. Relief is shown by spot elevations in meters. Two distance scales are provided, versts and kilometers. In 1921 the Red Army invaded Georgia, and it became a Soviet socialist republic, once again under Russian domination.

However, regional food shortages, diseases, war, and water shortages have tended to limit population increases, and the efficiency of food production in developed countries has improved greatly particularly over the last 50 years. Nevertheless, during the last half-century the global population has more than doubled from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 6 billion in October 2000. Forecasts of future global human populations have ranged from 7.7 billion to 13 billion by 2050. Enormous increases of energy, food and water supplies are absolutely essential to support such expanded populations. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas are finite resources, and the availability of oil and oil-based chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, will peak by 2010 and will be exhausted, or prohibitively expensive, by 2050. Known sources of renewable energy such as nuclear, solar, wind, and water power systems have the potential to supply only 20-30% of our current energy needs. Since 1980 the per capita production of food has been decreasing progressively due to: loss of land; soil erosion and exhaustion; deforestation; and urbanization. Fresh water supplies are decreasing globally and agriculture consumes more than 93% of the available water for irrigation. Additionally, gaseous emissions have been predicted to raise global temperatures by as much as 10\\u00a1C in the next 100 years, with the potential for drastic effects on agricultural production. Even if innovative renewable energy technologies are developed; the losses of productive soils retarded; biological alternatives to energy-based chemicals discovered; new sources of fresh water found; and climatic changes slowed; the world population cannot continue to increase at its current rates. We may already be close to peak human populations, which may have to stabilize in the long term at 2-3 billion, unless there are enormous technological developments in food production and environmental conservation. ; Introduction by Ed Ray, Executive Vice-President and Provost of The Ohio State University (00:00:00-00:03:50) -- Presentation (00:03:51-00:56:15) -- Questions (00:56:16-01:12:26)\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2001-04-26\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"the future; energy food; food water\",\"authors\":\"Edwards, C.

Carmelita remembers the day when Chodi fell while carrying a bunch of rattan stems, and both speakers laugh about it. They continue speaking and state that life is becoming harder nowadays given that the rice prices have increased significantly, while at the time they were even able to plant rice. Now they can\\u2019t plant anymore given that there are too many sparrows. Pelicito explains that nowadays, they rather use snares to in order catch animals, which they have to place far away in the mountains because the wild pags are scarce. At the time, they could not go very far, because if an Alta entered the domain of the Ilongot tribe he could get killed. Pelicito and Carmelita continue explaining that the quality of the soil has decreased in the last years, but in the past they wouldn\\u2019t not need to use any chemical product in order to get big sweet potatoes and other vegetables. Finally, the describe other things that have changed in the last years, which have an impact on their lives.

Gaskins became interested in getting involved with this event due to her recent participation in the conference Alien Bodies: Race, Space and Sex in the African Diaspora (http:\\/\\/alienbodies.wordpress.com) at Emory University and her interest in the idea of Afrofuturism, which, according to Sanford Biggers (http:\\/\\/www.sanfordbiggers.com), is \\u201ca way of re-contextualizing and assessing history and imagining the future of the African Diaspora via science, science fiction, technology, sound, architecture, the visual culinary arts and other more nimble and interpretive modes of research and understanding.\\u201d \\u201cDuring Pressor Alondra Nelson\\u2019s keynote, who is one of the leading Afrofuturism scholars, I noted that \\u2018appropriating technology\\u201d such as in hip-hop production is Afrofuturism, thus, science fiction,\\u201d Gaskins says. \\u201cMusic, art, and literature are expressions of agency that empower people who are often missing in mainstream science fiction to envision a different future for themselves. Abdul R. JanMohamed, an Emory professor and moderator at the conference, said that \\u2018Afrofuturism is about seeing the future as being a vehicle for creating a different present.\\u2019 So I contacted the organizers of the Young Guru event and said that I would love to talk about this \\u2018A-ha!\\u2019 moment I had.\\u201d The history of hip-hop and the art of audio engineering does have much to teach those of us who study digital media and how it influences creativity and culture. \\u201cHip-hop production is at the intersection of creativity, innovation, and culture,\\u201d Gaskins explains. \\u201cAlondra Nelson wrote in her book Technicolor: Race, Technology, and Everyday Life, that \\u2018by refunctioning old\\/obsolete technologies or inventing new uses for common ones, communities in many places have fashioned technologies to fit their needs and priorities. In the process, they have become innovators, create new asethetic forms, new avenues for political action, and new ways to articulate their identities.\\u2019 I think that if we study the aspects of hip-hop production we will find keys to engage groups that have low participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.\\u201d Young Guru, then, becomes an excellent person to ask these questions due to his experience in the field.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-03-05\",\"subject_orig\":\"Music; Hip hop; Technology; Digital media; Culture; Underrepresented minorities\",\"subject\":\"Music; Hip hop; Technology; Digital media; Culture; Underrepresented minorities\",\"authors\":\"Keaton, Gimel (Young Guru); Gaskins, Nettrice\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1853\\/46493\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f044a788db153f0030412bc7ad3c75788620045f168b6c5cc08861f6145bd30e\",\"relevance\":110,\"resulttype\":[\"Audio\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Indoor cannabis production, Portfolio approach, Alternative liquid fuels\",\"x\":\"2.77007779082669\",\"y\":\"1.5270053955658\",\"labels\":\"f044a788db153f0030412bc7ad3c75788620045f168b6c5cc08861f6145bd30e\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Indoor cannabis production, Portfolio approach, Alternative liquid fuels\"},{\"id\":\"f5087f0ba6be0be270963665d1a51d7c18b43342ff408bb248db53dff91f0e71\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.0860\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.loc.gov\\/loc.mbrsmi\\/awal.0860\",\"title\":\"Carriers leaving building, U.S.P.O.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Male letter carriers of the U.S. Post Office are the subject of this series on the Postal Department.

Coexistence practitioners can be more effective by expanding from a direct focus on carnivores and predation-prevention tools to livestock management context. Ranchers can apply many of the same approaches that work for rangeland health and livestock production to reduce conflicts with large carnivores. The central anti-predator behavior of wild grazing animals is to form large, dense herds that then move around the landscape to seek fresh forage, avoid fouled areas, and escape predators. They also have their young in short, synchronized birthing seasons (predator satiation). Grazing management involving high stocking density and frequent movement, such as rotational grazing and herding with low-stress livestock handling, can improve rangeland health and livestock production, by managing the distribution of grazing across time, space, and plant species. Short calving seasons can increase livestock production and reduce labor inputs, especially when timed to coincide with peak availability of forage quality. Livestock management approaches based on anti-predator behaviors of wild ungulates, including grazing management and synchronized calving, may directly and synergistically reduce predation risk\\u2014while simultaneously establishing a management context in which other predation-prevention practices and tools can be used more effectively. Pilot projects on summer cattle range in the U.S. Northern Rockies involving increased stocking density through intensification of existing grazing rotations with herding suggest methods that can be used to improve grazing distribution and prevent depredations.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2007-01-03T05:13:53Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"carnivores healthy; coexistence large; healthy land\",\"authors\":\"Barnes, Matt\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10217\\/86148\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"fca3ec641114991e86d60a6ad0c7c30ad1e7664c6a95b7c2d4b0f8aa12a7745a\",\"relevance\":43,\"resulttype\":[\"Text\",\"Still image\",\"Moving image\\/video\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Golden age hip-hop, Analyses supporting, Carnivores healthy\",\"x\":\"1.86212041855323\",\"y\":\"-0.468788372317601\",\"labels\":\"fca3ec641114991e86d60a6ad0c7c30ad1e7664c6a95b7c2d4b0f8aa12a7745a\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Golden age hip-hop, Analyses supporting, Carnivores healthy\"},{\"id\":\"fd2d6a39723400e1fb6846a4c2cd8600d31a06c93deb33f8b9d45ab4c641922e\",\"relation\":\"Rey, S; McAdam, B (2021): Open Data and supplementary information_JFB 14761.
