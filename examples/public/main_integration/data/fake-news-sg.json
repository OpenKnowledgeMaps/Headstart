Meanwhile, it also enables the wide dissemination of fake news, i.e., news with intentionally false information, which brings significant negative effects to the society. Thus, fake news detection is attracting increasing attention. However, fake news detection is a non-trivial task, which requires multi-source information such as news content, social context, and dynamic information. First, fake news is written to fool people, which makes it difficult to detect fake news simply based on news contents. In addition to news contents, we need to explore social contexts such as user engagements and social behaviors. For example, a credible user's comment that \\\"this is a fake news\\\" is a strong signal for detecting fake news. Second, dynamic information such as how fake news and true news propagate and how users' opinions toward news pieces are very important for extracting useful patterns for (early) fake news detection and intervention.

To fully understand the nature of each instance of fake news, it is important to observe it from various perspectives, such as the intention of the false news disseminator, the harmfulness of the news to our society, and the target of the news.

Temporal features in fake news detection have the advantage of robustness over existing features because it has minimal dependence on fake news propagators. Further, we propose a novel multi-modal attention-based method, which includes linguistic and user features alongside temporal features, for detecting fake news from SNS posts.

Researchers, policymakers and practitioners are eagerly searching for solutions to get us out of the \\u2018fake news crisis\\u2019. Here, one approach is to use automated tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, in conjunction with human inputs to identify fake news. The study in this article demonstrates how AI and machine learning, with its ability to analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, can help us tell apart fake and real news content. Specifically, this study examines if and how the emotional appeal, i.e., sentiment valence and strength of specific emotions, in fake news content differs from that in real news content. This is important to understand, as messages with a strong emotional appeal can influence how content is consumed, processed and shared by consumers. Design\\/methodology\\/approach: The study analyzes a data set of 150 real and fake news articles using an AI application, to test for differences in the emotional appeal in the titles and the text body between fake news and real news content. Findings: The results suggest that titles are a strong differentiator on emotions between fake and real news and that fake news titles are substantially more negative than real news titles. In addition, the results reveal that the text body of fake news is substantially higher in displaying specific negative emotions, such as disgust and anger, and lower in displaying positive emotions, such as joy. Originality\\/value: This is the first empirical study that examines the emotional appeal of fake and real news content with respect to the prevalence and strength of specific emotion dimensions, thus adding to the literature on fake news identification and marketing communications.

However, it also enables the wide propagation of fake news, i.e., news with intentionally false information. Detecting fake news is an important task, which not only ensures users to receive authentic information but also help maintain a trustworthy news ecosystem. The majority of existing detection algorithms focus on finding clues from news contents, which are generally not effective because fake news is often intentionally written to mislead users by mimicking true news. Therefore, we need to explore auxiliary information to improve detection. The social context during news dissemination process on social media forms the inherent tri-relationship, the relationship among publishers, news pieces, and users, which has potential to improve fake news detection.

Although some studies do not support these correlations, it appears that conservatives, right-wing people, the elderly and less educated people are more likely to believe and spread fake news.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Sciences, Vol 9, Iss 185, p 185 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"fake news; media consumption; social media; political ideology; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"fake news; media consumption; social media; political ideology; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Jo\\u00e3o Pedro Baptista; Anabela Gradim\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/socsci9100185\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"ce5fa1c1b54a8fc90f9e8160f874329ce718a7b2969d97b47caec6eabb2cb5ca\",\"relevance\":416,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/socsci9100185\"},{\"id\":\"6618f308e79adb8737922f94c2fef509cee7b4ab6e47bf97cf862197f160eb6d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1007\\/978-3-030-42699-6\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.2003.05096; https:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/abs\\/2003.05096\",\"title\":\"Exploring the Role of Visual Content in Fake News Detection ...\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The increasing popularity of social media promotes the proliferation of fake news, which has caused significant negative societal effects. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research area of great concern. With the development of multimedia technology, fake news attempts to utilize multimedia content with images or videos to attract and mislead consumers for rapid dissemination, which makes visual content an important part of fake news. Despite the importance of visual content, our understanding of the role of visual content in fake news detection is still limited. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of the visual content in fake news, including the basic concepts, effective visual features, representative detection methods and challenging issues of multimedia fake news detection. This chapter can help readers to understand the role of visual content in fake news detection, and effectively utilize visual content to assist in detecting multimedia fake news. ... : This is a preprint of a chapter published in Disinformation, Misinformation, and Fake News in Social Media: Emerging Research Challenges and Opportunities, edited by Kai, S., Suhang, W., Dongwon, L., Huan, L, 2020, Springer reproduced with permission of Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Current fake news detection methods rely heavily on text information by learning the extracted news content or writing style of internal knowledge. However, deliberate rumors can mask writing style, bypassing language models and invalidating simple text-based models. In fact, news articles and other related components (such as news creators and news topics) can be modeled as a heterogeneous information network (HIN for short). In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, namely Hierarchical Graph Attention Network(HGAT), which uses a novel hierarchical attention mechanism to perform node representation learning in HIN, and then detects fake news by classifying news article nodes. Experiments on two real-world fake news datasets show that HGAT can outperform text-based models and other network-based models.

Some fake news detection methods are already quite successful. Nevertheless, there are still many vulnerabilities in the detection algorithms. The reason for this is that fake news publishers can structure and formulate their texts in such a way that a detection algorithm does not expose this text as fake news. This paper shows that it is possible to automatically attack state-of-the-art models that have been trained to detect Fake News, making these vulnerable. For this purpose, corresponding models were first trained based on a dataset. Then, using Text-Attack, an attempt was made to manipulate the trained models in such a way that previously correctly identified fake news was classified as true news.

The study shows that propaganda is effective if society receives customized information that triggers the expected emotional response of the target audience. For these purposes, the article establishes the fundamental mechanisms for using fake news. The research presents the criteria for identifying fake news and develops its classification according to the degree of falsity.

In the flurry of discussion, the term has been applied so broadly as to threaten to render it meaningless. In an effort to rescue our ability to discuss\\u2014and combat\\u2014the underlying phenomenon that triggered the present use of the term, some philosophers have tried to characterize it more precisely. A common theme in this nascent philosophical discussion is that contemporary fake news is not a new kind of phenomenon, but just the latest iteration of a broader kind of phenomenon that has played out in different ways across the history of human information-dissemination technologies. While we agree with this, we argue that newer sorts of fake news reveal substantial flaws in earlier understandings of this notion. In particular, we argue that no deceptive intentions are necessary for fake news to arise; rather, fake news arises when stories which were not produced via standard journalistic practice are treated as though they had been. Importantly, this revisionary understanding of fake news allows us to accommodate and understand the way that fake news is plausibly generated and spread in a contemporary setting, as much by non-human actors as by ordinary human beings.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophy\",\"subject\":\"Philosophy\",\"authors\":\"Pepp, Jessica; Michaelson, Eliot; Sterken, Rachel\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/PEPWNA\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"2be81921dae3d7bae0ef944b06c28e74efd4effa5b15a93ffe5aaeadb9a73212\",\"relevance\":395,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"d1b3bced205cbcaaea96d51c22d4532a6123bc7e156b96d9cc691a85add72d22\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/JASSOF-2\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/JASSOF-2\",\"title\":\"Speaking of Fake News: Definitions and Dimensions\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper shows why defining \\u201efake news\\u201c is worthwhile and what a suitable definition of \\u201cfake news\\u201d might look like.

Machine learning helps to solve complex problems and to build AI systems nowadays and especially in those cases where we have tacit knowledge or the knowledge that is not known. We used machine learning algorithms and for identification of fake news; we applied three classifiers; Passive Aggressive, Na\\u00efve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. Simple classification is not completely correct in fake news detection because classification methods are not specialized for fake news. With the integration of machine learning and text-based processing, we can detect fake news and build classifiers that can classify the news data. Text classification mainly focuses on extracting various features of text and after that incorporating those features into classification.

Beyond an understanding of the empirical effects of fake news on democratic institutions that recent scholarship has shed light on, emergent research also points to the potential of fake news being weaponised as a discursive tool to achieve political ends. In that light, this study sets out to analyse the discourses of fake news as advanced by states. Results from a critical discourse analysis of articles relating to fake news ( n = 450) from four countries \\u2013 Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam \\u2013 reveal four key findings: first, fake news is being framed as an existential security issue that directly threatens foundational societal values. Second, fake news as an issue is constructed as a new and unprecedented contemporary problem, and compared on equal terms to other security threats such as terrorism, chemical attacks and cyberwarfare. Third, the threat of fake news is used to justify the passing of broad-reaching legislation and curbs on free speech that are construed as aligned with global democratic norms. Lastly, the term is used to facilitate unsubstantiated \\u2018lying press\\u2019 accusations against media outlets. Overall, this study suggests that fake news can be damaging to the quality of democracies not only as a result of its dissemination, but also through the discursive instrumentalisation of the term to curb civil liberties and justify crackdowns.\",\"published_in\":\"Journalism ; page 146488492098406 ; ISSN 1464-8849 1741-3001\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous); Communication\",\"subject\":\"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous); Communication\",\"authors\":\"Neo, Ric\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1464884920984060\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"44bdef4e7100dfbc2ad90d521cdb62453d15be2b05928424d203412a853cf55e\",\"relevance\":371,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1464884920984060\"},{\"id\":\"eb855e39dae7fd5be8c87030e819c134c0d7dc96977c6180616217d3563256b1\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ijarcs.info\\/index.php\\/Ijarcs\\/article\\/view\\/6358\\/5152; http:\\/\\/www.ijarcs.info\\/index.php\\/Ijarcs\\/article\\/view\\/6358; doi:10.26483\\/ijarcs.v10i1.6358\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ijarcs.info\\/index.php\\/Ijarcs\\/article\\/view\\/6358; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.26483\\/ijarcs.v10i1.6358\",\"title\":\"EFFECTS OF HUMAN AND HUMAN-MACHINE FAKE NEWS DETECTION APPROACHES ON USER DETECTION PERFORMANCE\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract: The detection of fake news is a relevant problem-solving mechanism.

Participants perform a small classification task where they were asked to determine if a news article was fake or not. The study used two levels of a within-subject design; where each participant used both the human-based approach and the human-machine approach.

Previous review papers were based on data mining and machine learning techniques, scarcely exploring the deep learning techniques for fake news detection. However, emerging deep learning-based approaches such as Attention, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers are absent from previous surveys.

Then, we proceed with the discussion on the dataset used in previous research and their NLP techniques.

However, the challenging problem of fake news detection has not benefited from the improvement of fact verification models, which is closely related to fake news detection. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to connect the dots between fact verification and fake news detection. Our approach first employs a text summarization model pre-trained on news corpora to summarize the long news article into a short claim. Then we use a fact verification model pre-trained on the FEVER dataset to detect whether the input news article is real or fake.

However, training an effective deep learning model usually requires a large amount of labeled news, while it is expensive and time-consuming to provide sufficient labeled news in actual applications. To improve the detection performance of fake news, we take advantage of the event correlations of news and propose an event correlation filtering method (ECFM) for fake news detection, mainly consisting of the news characterizer, the pseudo label annotator, the event credibility updater, and the news entropy selector.

The intentional misleading of fake news makes the automatic detection of fake news an important and challenging problem, which has not been well understood at present. Meanwhile, fake news can contain true evidence imitating the true news and present different degrees of falsity, which further aggravates the difficulty of detection. On the other hand, the fake news speaker himself provides rich social behavior information, which provides unprecedented opportunities for advanced fake news detection. In this study, we propose a new hybrid deep model based on behavior information (HMBI), which uses the social behavior information of the speaker to detect fake news more accurately. Specifically, we model news content and social behavior information simultaneously to detect the degrees of falsity of news. The experimental analysis on real-world data shows that the detection accuracy of HMBI is increased by 10.41% on average, which is the highest of the existing model.

The spread of this type of misinformation is a severe danger to social cohesiveness and well-being since it increases political polarisation and people&#x2019;s distrust of their leaders. Thus, fake news is a phenomenon that is having a significant impact on our social lives, particularly in politics. This paper proposes novel approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) for the fake news detection system to address this phenomenon. The main aim of this paper is to find the optimal model that obtains high accuracy performance. Therefore, we propose an optimized Convolutional Neural Network model to detect fake news (OPCNN-FAKE). We compare the performance of the OPCNN-FAKE with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and The six regular ML techniques: Decision Tree (DT), logistic Regression (LR), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) using four fake news benchmark datasets. Grid search and hyperopt optimization techniques have been used to optimize the parameters of ML and DL, respectively. In addition, N-gram and Term Frequency&#x2014;Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) have been used to extract features from the benchmark datasets for regular ML, while Glove word embedding has been used to represent features as a feature matrix for DL models. To evaluate the performance of the OPCNN-FAKE, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure were applied to validate the results. The results show that OPCNN-FAKE model has achieved the best performance for each dataset compared with other models. Furthermore, the OPCNN-FAKE has a higher performance of cross-validation results and testing results over the other models, which indicates that the OPCNN-FAKE for fake news detection is significantly better than the other models.\",\"published_in\":\"IEEE Access, Vol 9, Pp 129471-129489 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fake news; machine learning; deep learning; neural network; convolutional neural network; detection; Electrical engineering.

While there is empirical evidence that dissemination of fake news on social media and enactments of anti-fake news laws are on the rise globally, most of the empirical studies on fake news continue to focus on its political impacts and presence on social media. News television stations work under the premise of trust, credibility and speed now threatened by fake news hence the need to explore how they spot it . The specific research question was: How do news television stations in Kenya spot fake news?. The Gate keeping theory aided conceptualization of this study. The study adapted a relativist-constructivist\\/interpretivist philosophical paradigm hence qualitative approach and multiple case study method. The target population comprised of reporters and editors. A sample size of 16 participants from two television stations was selected using purposive sampling technique. Data was generated through in depth interviews and observations. Data was analysed thematically and presented in narrative form based on themes. The findings show that television stations spot fake news through counterchecking and verification, instinct, delays, online reverse search, calling the source, evaluating source\\u2019s credibility, chains of gate keepers, and editorial social media groups. Despite the numerous spotting practices fake news had permeated and aired on television resulting in court charges, fines, apologies and sacking of journalists. This study concludes that practices of spotting fake news by television stations in Kenya are incoherent, informal and weakly anchored on policy documents thus insufficient. Therefore, recommends that editorial boards establish standard and well documented practices for spotting fake news to arrest its growing threat to trust in news and journalism.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fake news; Journalism; Television broadcasting\",\"subject\":\"Fake news; Journalism; Television broadcasting\",\"authors\":\"Kabucua, John; Nyakundi, Nyamboga; Nguri, Matu\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.mu.ac.ke:8080\\/jspui\\/handle\\/123456789\\/6154\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"5f1ff0e1653d15889658b148f0586e6d4e974ee95dd90fef22114685f2b7d218\",\"relevance\":335,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"5897aacef85a36601daeb2732c7a54cee249d3edf189e5d2ba7ef44d93dfa422\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S2451958822000239; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2451-9588; 2451-9588; doi:10.1016\\/j.chbr.2022.100189; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/bd07b09d058b41fdb3428369ed3ca2b7\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.chbr.2022.100189; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/bd07b09d058b41fdb3428369ed3ca2b7\",\"title\":\"Assessment of the spread of fake news of Covid-19 amongst social media users in Kano State, Nigeria\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The issue of fake news and its impact has become prominent in recent times.

First, we critically discuss the most important definitions of the umbrella term fake news, in the so-called post-truth era, in order to emphasize different challenges in conceptualizing this elusive social phenomenon. Second, employing some valuable contribution from literature, we present and illustrate with vivid examples 10 categories of fake news. Each type of fake news is discussed in the context of organizational communication. Based on existent literature, we propose a 3D conceptual model of fake news, in an organizational context. Furthermore, we consider that PR managers can use either reactive PR strategies to counteract online fake news regarding an organization, or communication stratagems to temporarily transform the organization served into a potential source of fake news. The existing typology of reactive public relations strategies from the literature allow us to discuss the challenge of using them in counteracting online fake news. Each reactive PR strategy can be a potential solution to respond to different types of online fake news. Although these possibilities seem to be extensive, in some cases, PR managers can find them ineffective. In our view, this cluster of reactive PR strategies is not a panacea for managing fake news in the online environment and different strategic approaches may be need, such as communication stratagems. In this context, communication stratagems consist in using organization as a source or as a vector for strategic creation and dissemination of online fake news, for the benefit of the organization. We conclude that within online environment PR managers can employ a variety of reactive PR strategies to counteract fake news, or different communication stratagems to achieve organizational goals.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophy\",\"subject\":\"Philosophy\",\"authors\":\"Farte, Gheorghe-Ilie; Obada, Daniel-Rares\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/FARRPR\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"836e52d670ede5c278e2dd4254c6b00cab32330e0012e221b101b893a8d0e3bd\",\"relevance\":330,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"248752a6f33afa05e5411ea8c65796b3394a7a266328e0dd4f7634ac7cd5b1c4\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2078-2489\\/12\\/1\\/20; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2078-2489; doi:10.3390\\/info12010020; 2078-2489; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a585da8fe1ef472288856e0b993ab67d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/info12010020; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a585da8fe1ef472288856e0b993ab67d\",\"title\":\"Combating Fake News in \\u201cLow-Resource\\u201d Languages: Amharic Fake News Detection Accompanied by Resource Crafting\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The need to fight the progressive negative impact of fake news is escalating, which is evident in the strive to do research and develop tools that could do this job.

To understand consumers' reactions and actions towards fake news, and their trust in various news media, we conducted a survey in Singapore.

Verification of news was done mainly by using a search engine to check and cross-reference the news. Amongst the top three sources to obtain news, there was low trust reported in social media, high trust in local news channels, and highest trust in government communication platforms.

As a result, many researchers have been working on identifying fake news. Most of the fake news detection systems utilize the linguistic feature of the news. However, they have difficulty in sensing highly ambiguous fake news which can be detected only after identifying meaning and latest related information. In this paper, to resolve this problem, we shall present a new Korean fake news detection system using fact DB which is built and updated by human's direct judgement after collecting obvious facts. Our system receives a proposition, and search the semantically related articles from Fact DB in order to verify whether the given proposition is true or not by comparing the proposition with the related articles in fact DB. To achieve this, we utilize a deep learning model, Bidirectional Multi Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentence BiMPM , which has demonstrated a good performance for the sentence matching task.

In this work, we focus on propagation-based fake news detection, as recent studies have demonstrated that fake news and real news spread differently online. Specifically, considering the capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in dealing with non-Euclidean data, we use GNNs to differentiate between the propagation patterns of fake and real news on social media. In particular, we concentrate on two questions: (1) Without relying on any text information, e.g., tweet content, replies and user descriptions, how accurately can GNNs identify fake news? Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and avoiding the dependence on text-based features can make the model less susceptible to the manipulation of advanced fake news fabricators.

To mitigate its negative impact, we argue that it is critical to understand what user attributes potentially cause users to share fake news. The key to this causal-inference problem is to identify confounders -- variables that cause spurious associations between treatments (e.g., user attributes) and outcome (e.g., user susceptibility). In fake news dissemination, confounders can be characterized by fake news sharing behavior that inherently relates to user attributes and online activities. Learning such user behavior is typically subject to selection bias in users who are susceptible to share news on social media. Drawing on causal inference theories, we first propose a principled approach to alleviating selection bias in fake news dissemination.

Kashmir is one of the few places where Internet services are often disrupted by government to stop the spread of \\u201cmisinformation\\u201d during the escalation of violence. But it is never clear as what constitutes \\u201cmisinformation\\u201d for the government. The repercussions of fake news in a conflict place can be dangerous given the role it can play in mobilizing people and ideas. This paper looks into how social media is used to spread fake news in Kashmir and who are the players involved in it. It also explores how the absence of any fake news ...\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fake News, Rumors, Kashmir, Social Media\",\"subject\":\"Fake News, Rumors, Kashmir, Social Media\",\"authors\":\"Bhat, Ab Rouf; Afshana, Syeda\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2605482\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"3a782d02266387134c918adc223aa8fad3e9d0dbdae8b5fb64074d2124cac193\",\"relevance\":298,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\",\"Text\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2605482\"},{\"id\":\"e11f74a8b5a5c9735fdf55f102a832b58d24ddbc5b39481d86a58caec9bd1098\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/3459637.3482139\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.2201.00987; https:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/abs\\/2201.00987\",\"title\":\"MDFEND: Multi-domain Fake News Detection ...\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Fake news spread widely on social media in various domains, which lead to real-world threats in many aspects like politics, disasters, and finance. Most existing approaches focus on single-domain fake news detection (SFND), which leads to unsatisfying performance when these methods are applied to multi-domain fake news detection. As an emerging field, multi-domain fake news detection (MFND) is increasingly attracting attention. However, data distributions, such as word frequency and propagation patterns, vary from domain to domain, namely domain shift. Facing the challenge of serious domain shift, existing fake news detection techniques perform poorly for multi-domain scenarios. Therefore, it is demanding to design a specialized model for MFND. In this paper, we first design a benchmark of fake news dataset for MFND with domain label annotated, namely Weibo21, which consists of 4,488 fake news and 4,640 real news from 9 different domains.

On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media.

The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ineffective or not applicable.

The paper looks at a mix of emotion-driven content, sentimental resonance, topic modeling and linguistic features of news articles to predict the probability of fake news. Design\\/methodology\\/approach A data set of over 12,000 articles was chosen to develop a model for fake news detection. Machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques were used to handle big data with efficiency. Lexicon-based emotion analysis provided eight kinds of emotions used in the article text. The cluster of topics was extracted using topic modeling (five topics), while sentiment analysis provided the resonance between the title and the text. Linguistic features were added to the coding outcomes to develop a logistic regression predictive model for testing the significant variables. Other machine learning algorithms were also executed and compared. Findings The results revealed that positive emotions in a text lower the probability of news being fake. It was also found that sensational content like illegal activities and crime-related content were associated with fake news. The news title and the text exhibiting similar sentiments were found to be having lower chances of being fake. News titles with more words and content with fewer words were found to impact fake news detection significantly. Practical implications Several systems and social media platforms today are trying to implement fake news detection methods to filter the content. This research provides exciting parameters from a viral theory perspective that could help develop automated fake news detectors. Originality\\/value While several studies have explored fake news detection, this study uses a new perspective on viral theory. It also introduces new parameters like sentimental resonance that could help predict fake news. This study deals with an extensive data set and uses advanced natural language processing to automate the coding techniques in developing the prediction model.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Systems and Information Technology ; volume 24, issue 2, page 131-155 ; ISSN 1328-7265 1328-7265\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"General Computer Science; Information Systems\",\"subject\":\"General Computer Science; Information Systems\",\"authors\":\"Nanath, Krishnadas; Kaitheri, Supriya; Malik, Sonia; Mustafa, Shahid\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/jsit-11-2020-0257\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"a0fc29eb06a29c9ad1ddb7459161ec8f041446e1631fafbabd42a2f0d45bad71\",\"relevance\":292,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/jsit-11-2020-0257\"},{\"id\":\"67efcb8ffb76abb4723340aa040d531a714d9b3d708f6b74a64a2359754d94c3\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.1907.07759; https:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/abs\\/1907.07759\",\"title\":\"The Mass, Fake News, and Cognition Security ...\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The wide spread of fake news in social networks is posing threats to social stability, economic development and political democracy etc. Numerous studies have explored the effective detection approaches of online fake news, while few works study the intrinsic propagation and cognition mechanisms of fake news.

Partially to combat fake news, several fact-checking sites such as Snopes and PolitiFact have been founded. Nevertheless, these sites rely on time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks. Moreover, their available languages are not extensive. To address these difficulties, we propose a new fake news collection system based on rule-based (unsupervised) frameworks that can be extended easily for various languages.

While many information professions are focused on combatting fake news through media literacy education, policy development, and advancements in search and social media technology, the archival profession has a slightly different task: evaluating how fake news can be preserved. The proliferation of fake news marks a significant cultural shift in information, politics, and identity, and is a valuable retrospective on how we consume and share media and assess its collective impact on society. But archiving fake news is a complex endeavor, particularly when it comes to ensuring that the archive includes enough context to help future researchers interpret the information.

Upon analyzing current approaches for fake news generation and human-crafted articles, we found that there is a gap between them, which can explain the poor performance on detecting human-written fake news for detectors trained on automatically generated data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for generating articles closer to human-written ones. Specifically, we perform self-critical sequence training with natural language inference to ensure the validity of the generated articles. We then explicitly incorporate propaganda techniques into the generated articles to mimic how humans craft fake news.

Notably missing from the conversation, however, is a discussion of fake news and conspiracy theory media as a market. This paper will take as its starting point the account of noxious markets put forward by Debra Satz and will argue that there is a pro tanto moral reason to restrict the market for fake news. Specifically, we begin with Satz's argument that restricting a market may be required when (i) that market inhibits citizens from being able to stand in an equal relationship with one another, and (ii) this problem cannot be solved without such direct restrictions. Our own argument then proceeds in three parts: first, we argue that the market for fake news fits Satz's description of a noxious market; second, we argue against explanations of the proliferation of fake news that are couched in terms of \\u2018epistemic vice\\u2019 and likewise argue against prescribing critical thinking education as a solution to the problem; finally, we conclude that, in the absence of other solutions to mitigate the noxious effects of the fake news market, we have a pro tanto moral reason to impose restrictions on this market. At the end of the paper, we consider one proposal to regulate the fake news market, which involves making social media outlets potentially liable in civil court for damages caused by the fake news hosted on their websites.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of the American Philosophical Association ; page 1-22 ; ISSN 2053-4477 2053-4485\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophy\",\"subject\":\"Philosophy\",\"authors\":\"FRITTS, MEGAN; CABRERA, FRANK\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/apa.2021.11\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"3ade1bea12627ccfefa5e55d93e1231b4faefd9180ec3eccb26b7dc54b0052bd\",\"relevance\":247,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/apa.2021.11\"},{\"id\":\"917d95f6488f861cbbfc2c6bf294aa6bf819e4823bcf32695529d3b9bb00bafc\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2076-328X\\/12\\/2\\/51; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2076-328X; doi:10.3390\\/bs12020051; 2076-328X; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/40359acfcde54e75978de83877276aa3\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/bs12020051; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/40359acfcde54e75978de83877276aa3\",\"title\":\"Trust, Media Credibility, Social Ties, and the Intention to Share towards Information Verification in an Age of Fake News\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Social media is now the primary form of communication between internet users and has soared in popularity, which has directly impacted the spread of the phenomenon of fake news. Fake news is not only a widespread phenomenon; it is also problematic and dangerous for society. The aim of this study is to understand the phenomenon of fake news better. The study utilised a structural modelling equation in order to identify how Polish society perceives the problem of fake news and assess the extent to which it trusts content that is published on the internet. The key goal was to determine what factors have the most significant influence on the verification of information being viewed on the internet. By deploying the partial least squares method of validation, SmartPLS3 software was used to process the survey results. The strongest positive effect on information verification behaviour was found to be fake news awareness, which was followed by the intention to share information. The research did not consider any clear connections that may exist between the nature of fake news and its recipient; however, much of the fake news that appears on the internet is political in nature. The study can be used by news reporting companies and provides preliminary information for developers responsible for running social media sites as well as users who want to combat and limit the spread of fake news online. This study expands on the available literature related to fake news by identifying the effects on information verification behaviour of fake news awareness and the intention to share data.\",\"published_in\":\"Behavioral Sciences, Vol 12, Iss 51, p 51 (2022)\",\"year\":\"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"fake news; social media; internet; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"fake news; social media; internet; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Przemys\\u0142aw Majerczak; Artur Strzelecki\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/bs12020051\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"917d95f6488f861cbbfc2c6bf294aa6bf819e4823bcf32695529d3b9bb00bafc\",\"relevance\":245,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/bs12020051\"},{\"id\":\"774dd49904dbca139d374199385bf50f075264b0115933fdea15d00ecf170fe5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/psychologyandeducation.net\\/pae\\/index.php\\/pae\\/article\\/view\\/1046; http:\\/\\/psychologyandeducation.net\\/pae\\/index.php\\/pae\\/article\\/view\\/1046; https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.4494366\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.4494365; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/4494365\",\"title\":\"Detecting Fake News using Machine Learning: A Systematic Literature Review ...\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Internet is one of the important inventions and a large number of persons are its users.

So some of the users try to spread fake news through these platforms. This fake news can be propaganda against an individual, society, organization, or political party. A human being is unable to detect all this fake news. So there is a need for machine learning classifiers that can detect this fake news automatically.

It is therefore essential to develop a simple mathematical model to understand the online dissemination of fake news. In this study, we propose a point process model of the spread of fake news on Twitter. The proposed model describes the spread of a fake news item as a two-stage process: initially, fake news spreads as a piece of ordinary news; then, when most users start recognizing the falsity of the news item, that itself spreads as another news story. We validate this model using two datasets of fake news items spread on Twitter. We show that the proposed model is superior to the current state-of-the-art methods in accurately predicting the evolution of the spread of a fake news item. Moreover, a text analysis suggests that our model appropriately infers the correction time, i.e., the moment when Twitter users start realizing the falsity of the news item. ... : Published at PLOS ONE in 2021 ...\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social and Information Networks cs.SI; Computers and Society cs.CY; FOS Computer and information sciences\",\"subject\":\"Social and Information ; SI; Computers and ; CY; FOS Computer and information sciences\",\"authors\":\"Murayama, Taichi; Wakamiya, Shoko; Aramaki, Eiji; Kobayashi, Ryota\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.2007.14059\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"2ef6072b8e8f35244c564b66d2cbcfc71d3a81e35c6ef80c388b2d157fe7cb0d\",\"relevance\":236,\"resulttype\":[\"Text\",\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.2007.14059\"},{\"id\":\"c0ebe4626b1652a29fa6425b5d13028453c7e53eb13b68aa59983eae66f900f0\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/gkmc-06-2019-0064; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/GKMC-06-2019-0064\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/GKMC-06-2019-0064\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"Internal communication and information integrity\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose Internal communication and information integrity \\u2013 a professional services approach to the impact of \\u201cfake news\\u201d.

Data was analysed using frequencies, counts and percentages, tables and charts. Findings revealed that people rely more on radio, television, and social media for information on COVID-19. Fake news is spread by people mostly for political reasons and intention to cause panic. In Nigeria, fake news has led to disbelief of the existence of the virus thereby leading to violation of precautionary measures among the citizenry and lack of trust in the government. Concerted effort on the part of the government is required to give public enlightenment on the danger of fake news. Also, directorate of anti-fake news should be established to censor and reprimand sources of fake news.

Therefore, it is extremely important to detect fake news as early as possible. Recently, deep learning based approaches have shown improved performance in fake news detection. However, the training of such models requires a large amount of labeled data, but manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature of news, annotated samples may become outdated quickly and cannot represent the news articles on newly emerged events.

Fake news is not a new problem and its spread in social networks is well-studied. Often an underlying assumption in fake news discussion is that it is written to look like real news, fooling the reader who does not check for reliability of the sources or the arguments in its content. Through a unique study of three data sets and features that capture the style and the language of articles, we show that this assumption is not true. Fake news in most cases is more similar to satire than to real news, leading us to conclude that persuasion in fake news is achieved through heuristics rather than the strength of arguments. We show overall title structure and the use of proper nouns in titles are very significant in differentiating fake from real. This leads us to conclude that fake news is targeted for audiences who are not likely to read beyond titles and is aimed at ... : Published at The 2nd International Workshop on News and Public Opinion at ICWSM ...\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social and Information Networks cs.SI; Computation and Language cs.CL; FOS Computer and information sciences\",\"subject\":\"Social and Information ; SI; Computation and ; CL; FOS Computer and information sciences\",\"authors\":\"Horne, Benjamin D.; Adali, Sibel\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.1703.09398\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"fe507f85242c7edf60cc1fe6c3f0d3191c097659ab85c54bb4e275810ab284cf\",\"relevance\":214,\"resulttype\":[\"Report\",\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.1703.09398\"},{\"id\":\"7f44e760b9ba058638d449b3b537c1c509e8f7a8500598d286edc48d92a6db80\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S2667096821000446; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2667-0968; 2667-0968; doi:10.1016\\/j.jjimei.2021.100051; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e42684fa1752492b855e636c44a6d3d5\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.jjimei.2021.100051; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e42684fa1752492b855e636c44a6d3d5\",\"title\":\"Optimization and improvement of fake news detection using deep learning approaches for societal benefit\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Fake news is a topic that has been discussed for quite some time. Prior to the internet era, it was mostly distributed through yellow journalism, with a focus on sensational news such as crime, rumours, accidents, and amusing news. To rescue the life of people from these fake news propagation, detection of fake news at an early stage becomes the most crucial step. People unknowingly propagate fake news and become a part of fake news propagation. While the original fake news propagators are the one with their aim to target innocent people for spreading the fake news. To stop this series of events, fake news detection and its pattern of propagation becomes very essential to society and the government. Various techniques exist to detect fake news in social media, among which neural networks have shown effective results. For this research, a deep learning based approach has been used to differentiate false news from the original ones. A LSTM neural network has been used to build the proposed model. Besides the neural network, a gloVe word embedding has been used for vector representation of textual words. Also, for feature extraction or vectorization, tokenization technique has been used. N-grams concept is used to enhance the proposed model. The comparative analysis of multiple fake news detection techniques is analysed. The results of proposed model have been evaluated using accuracy metrics. The model outperformed by achieving 99.88% of accuracy.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Information Management Data Insights, Vol 1, Iss 2, Pp 100051- (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Information technology; T58.5-58.64\",\"subject\":\"Information technology;; 5-\",\"authors\":\"Tavishee Chauhan, M.E; Hemant Palivela, PhD\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.jjimei.2021.100051\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"7f44e760b9ba058638d449b3b537c1c509e8f7a8500598d286edc48d92a6db80\",\"relevance\":208,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.jjimei.2021.100051\"},{\"id\":\"2ce4369562210930e8a989e6b726f4ac784f9b0cccb0227fda8c1369f5f5de30\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/lht-03-2017-0062; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/LHT-03-2017-0062\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/LHT-03-2017-0062\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"Fake news: belief in post-truth\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that the current efforts to combat the epidemic of fake news \\u2013 compiling lists of fake news sites, flagging stories as having been disputed as \\u201cfake,\\u201d downloading plug-ins to detect fake news \\u2013 show a fundamental misunderstanding of the issue.

This raises the question of how general awareness of fake news affects information processing by citizens. We address this deficit by theorizing about the consequences of awareness of fake news for receptivity to misinformation. We hypothesize that individuals induced to be more aware of fake news will be less likely to update beliefs and attitudes in response to information from news media. We test this theoretical expectation in a pre-registered experiment in cooperation with a national news magazine in Denmark. Results suggest that contrary to the hypothesis, primed and unprimed respondents react similarly. In both groups, misinformation affects approval of a fictional politician in the predicted direction, and a subsequent correction fully cancels out the initial effect of misinformation. The results suggest that the risk of fake news fatigue is limited and media outlets can discuss the phenomenon of fake news in general as well as present concrete factual corrections with little risk of engendering additional media skepticism.\",\"published_in\":\"Politica; \\u00c5rg. 53 Nr. 2 (2021): Politisk kommunikation i en ny medietid; 189 ; Politica.

However, scientific research on this social issue is still rather lacking. This article offers a contribution to research starting from a strictly sociological approach. First of all, it is shown that the phenomenon of fake news is an old and new phenomenon at the same time, even if to understand this phenomenon we do not need a new concept of fake news but a new media theory. The issue of fake news is then detached from two very commonly held misunderstandings: that in order to defend oneself from this type of news it is necessary to distinguish the true from the false, and that the news can be manipulated. The core distinction should be, however, that between information and non-information rather than that between information and misinformation.

The main hypothesis is that fake news exploit this information to \\u201cstage dissent\\u201d in the mass media system.

Therefore, it is becoming essential to develop fake news detection technologies.

In this work, we propose a new technique based on cross-lingual evidence (CE) that can be used for fake news detection and improve existing approaches. The hypothesis of the usage of cross-lingual evidence as a feature for fake news detection is confirmed, firstly, by manual experiment based on a set of known true and fake news. Besides, we compared our fake news classification system based on the proposed feature with several strong baselines on two multi-domain datasets of general-topic news and one newly fake COVID-19 news dataset showing that combining cross-lingual evidence with strong baselines such ...\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"Condensed Matter Physics; FOS Physical sciences; Semantics; Information and Knowledge Engineering; Neural Network; Electromagnetism; Computational Linguistics\",\"subject\":\"Condensed Matter Physics; FOS Physical sciences; Semantics; Information and Knowledge Engineering; Neural Network; Electromagnetism; Computational Linguistics\",\"authors\":\"The Joint Conference of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing 2021; Dementieva, Daryna\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48448\\/q8t0-rm05\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"f84aae6eec4c2346bc43152e16cbca5f1152004556fdf4d1481847d865272ebe\",\"relevance\":188,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48448\\/q8t0-rm05\"},{\"id\":\"cf95e8241b7da026fa76519892ff977fbb84f06541f3c00c3f8058ef9be814d1\",\"relation\":\"10.1007\\/s13369-021-06223-0; Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering; Makale - Uluslararas\\u0131 Hakemli Dergi - Kurum \\u00d6\\u011fretim Eleman\\u0131; 2193-567X - 2191-4281; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s13369-021-06223-0; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12462\\/12319; 47; 2; 2359; 2379\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12462\\/12319; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s13369-021-06223-0\",\"title\":\"Detection of Turkish fake news in Twitter with machine learning algorithms\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Topal, Kamil (Balikesir Author) ; Social media has affected people's information sources. Since most of the news on social media is not verified by a central authority, it may contain fake news for various reasons such as advertising and propaganda. Considering an average of 500 million tweets were posted daily on Twitter alone in the year of 2020, it is possible to control each share only with smart systems. In this study, we use Natural Language Processing methods to detect fake news for Turkish-language posts on certain topics on Twitter. Furthermore, we examine the follow\\/follower relations of the users who shared fake-real news on the same subjects through social network analysis methods and visualization tools. Various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms have been tested with different parameters. The most successful F1 score of fake news detection was obtained with the support vector machines algorithm with 0.9. People who share fake\\/true news can help in the separation of subgroups in the social network created by people and their followers. The results show that fake news propagation networks may show different characteristics in their own subject based on the follow\\/follower network.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fake News Detection; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Social Network Analysis\",\"subject\":\"Fake News Detection; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Social Network Analysis\",\"authors\":\"Ta\\u015fk\\u0131n, S\\u00fcleyman G\\u00f6khan; K\\u00fc\\u00e7\\u00fcksille, Ecir U\\u011fur; Topal, Kamil\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12462\\/12319\",\"oa_state\":0,\"url\":\"cf95e8241b7da026fa76519892ff977fbb84f06541f3c00c3f8058ef9be814d1\",\"relevance\":186,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"322373938928cf0cb9adce4957a0473e51ea72596166138f771a45e3397c715a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.lib.sfu.ca\\/index.php\\/jicw\\/article\\/view\\/2374\\/1810; https:\\/\\/journals.lib.sfu.ca\\/index.php\\/jicw\\/article\\/view\\/2374; doi:10.21810\\/jicw.v3i2.2374\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.lib.sfu.ca\\/index.php\\/jicw\\/article\\/view\\/2374; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21810\\/jicw.v3i2.2374\",\"title\":\"Fake News on Twitter in 2016 U.S. Presidential Election: A Quantitative Approach\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The flow of misinformation and disinformation around the 2016 U.S. presidential election put the problem of \\u201cfake news\\u201d on the agenda all over the world.

With a semi-representative survey in Mexico (N = 1211), this study analyzes a mediational process to determine the impact of the use of traditional and social media on compliance with contagion prevention measures, through the perception of veracity of fake news about COVID-19. As anticipated, results indicate that believing fake news leads to less compliance of preventive measures. Likewise, the analysis indicates that, consistent with our hypothesis, using social media leads to more belief in fake news, but contrary to our expectations, consuming traditional media also leads to a greater belief in fake news. In particular, the study explored the mediating role of belief in fake news on the effect that using traditional and social media has on compliance with preventive measures. We found evidence for this indirect effect: use of traditional and social media is a predictor of believing fake news about COVID-19, which then results in lower compliance with measures. In contrast, the direct effect of using traditional and social media on compliance with measures has a positive direction. Thus, this work evinces that fake news can hinder the resolution of the health crisis, by discouraging compliance with preventive strategies.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"Consumo de medios; Media use; desinformaci\\u00f3n; disinformation; COVID-19; redes sociales; social media; fake news; M\\u00e9xico\",\"subject\":\"Consumo de medios; Media use; desinformaci\\u00f3n; disinformation; redes sociales; social media; fake news; M\\u00e9xico\",\"authors\":\"Galarza-Molina, Roc\\u00edo; Mu\\u00f1iz, Carlos\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dspace.ups.edu.ec\\/handle\\/123456789\\/20858\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"5e09526046070fd9c7bf03e20c475bac05059b37aed6f3965cfdc564651c2bdd\",\"relevance\":175,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"3bf033dac5ded18e782248173aa08e8202749e58eca2529f5194c1f362936181\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.2107.12312; https:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/abs\\/2107.12312\",\"title\":\"'No, auntie, that's false': Female baby boomers develop critical skills to confront fake news with guidance from relatives ...\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The spread of fake news has been increasing, which gives rise to a special interest in the development of identification and coping skills among news consumers so that they can filter out misleading information.

Thereupon, we model each post as a network of friendship interactions and represent a collection of posts as a multidimensional tensor. Taking into account the available labeled data, we propose a tensor factorization method which associates the class labels of data samples with their latent representations.

Techniques on Social Networking Sites\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The phenomenon of fake news has become a much contentious issue recently. The controversy regarding this issue has further been intensified by the openness of social media platforms. Via a systematic review, this paper offers a discussion on the spread and detection techniques of fake news on Social Networking Sites (SNSs). A total of 47 articles eventually fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were coded for the literature synthesis. The overall findings from the literature on fake news and social media have been extracted and synthesized to explore the creation, influence and popular techniques and dimensions used for fake news detection on SNSs. The results showed that various entities are involved in the creation and spread of fake news on SNSs, including malicious social and software agents. It was also found that early registered users, old people, female users, delusion-prone persons, dogmatic persons, and religious fundamentalists are more likely to believe in fake news than other groups of individuals. One of the major problems of the existing techniques is their deficiency in datasets. Therefore, future studies on fake news detection should focus on developing an all-inclusive model with comprehensive datasets. Social media users require fake news detection skills especially using linguistic approach. This study provides the public with valuable information about the spread and detection of fake news on SNSs. This is because SNSs are an important avenue for fake news providers.\",\"published_in\":\"Romanian Journal of Communications and Public Relations, Vol 22, Iss 1, Pp 111-125 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Communication.

The study found that despite the awareness of fake news among the respondents, there is limited alertness with regard to sensitivity of verifying information before sharing. The study also found that politics and crisis suffer more fake news than any other nature. The study found that fake news is still crucial because there are rounds of perceptions that influence its nature and thus its spread. We also found that the respondents have negative perception about the extent to which fake news can affect democracy and democratic system of governance.

Prior work on the psychology of misinformation has focused primarily on the extent to which reason and deliberation hinder versus help the formation of accurate beliefs. Several studies have suggested that people who engage in more reasoning are less likely to fall for fake news. However, the role of reliance on emotion in belief in fake news remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, we explored the relationship between experiencing specific emotions and believing fake news (Study 1; N = 409). We found that across a wide range of specific emotions, heightened emotionality at the outset of the study was predictive of greater belief in fake (but not real) news posts. Then, in Study 2, we measured and manipulated reliance on emotion versus reason across four experiments (total N = 3884). We found both correlational and causal evidence that reliance on emotion increases belief in fake news: self-reported use of emotion was positively associated with belief in fake (but not real) news, and inducing reliance on emotion resulted in greater belief in fake (but not real) news stories compared to a control or to inducing reliance on reason. These results shed light on the unique role that emotional processing may play in susceptibility to fake news.\",\"published_in\":\"Cognitive Research, Vol 5, Iss 1, Pp 1-20 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fake news; Misinformation; Dual-process theory; Emotion; Reason; Consciousness.

While existing studies of fake news focus on theoretical modeling of propagation or identification methods based on machine learning, it is important to understand the realistic propagation mechanisms between theoretical models and black-box methods. Here we track large databases of fake news and real news in both, Weibo in China and Twitter in Japan from different cultures, which include their traces of re-postings. We find in both online social networks that fake news spreads distinctively from real news even at early stages of propagation, e.g. five hours after the first re-postings.

First, we report and discuss the various definitions of fake news and rumours that have been considered in the literature. Second, we highlight how the collection of relevant data for performing fake news and rumours detection is problematic and we present the various approaches, which have been adopted to gather these data, as well as the publicly available datasets. Third, we describe the features that have been considered in fake news and rumour detection approaches.

This study discovered several frames through a qualitative approach. One of the prominent fake news frames was intentionally misleading information that attacks the opposing political party and its advocators. The disinformation tweets overall presented far-right wing ideologies and included multiple hashtags and a YouTube video to promote and distribute their agendas while calling for coalition of far-right wing supporters. However, the fake news tweets often failed to provide a reliable source to back up credibility of the content.\",\"published_in\":\"Open Information Science ; volume 3, issue 1, page 137-153 ; ISSN 2451-1781\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Library and Information Sciences\",\"subject\":\"Library and Information Sciences\",\"authors\":\"Chong, Miyoung\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1515\\/opis-2019-0010\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"7307c290ef07b56ea811ac3e461273dd74ac84dd053635a18e31ce43f1e9dd69\",\"relevance\":126,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1515\\/opis-2019-0010\"},{\"id\":\"df6918cecc9414f891152fc9cac71ac567dff3c3db4814bc190f42e7586a19eb\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/iafor.org\\/journal\\/iafor-journal-of-arts-and-humanities\\/volume-5-issue-2\\/article-2\\/; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2187-0616; doi.org\\/10.22492\\/ijah.5.2.02; 2187-0616; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5ab78818c96a4ed797bbf345ec74ed19\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5ab78818c96a4ed797bbf345ec74ed19\",\"title\":\"Overcoming the Challenge of Fake News\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The advent of the Internet and the Information Age was initially hailed as ushering in a new era of transparency and interconnectivity in binding the world closer together.

However, until now there has been no clear understanding of how to define fake news, much less how to model it. This paper addresses both of these issues. A definition of fake news is given, and two approaches for the modelling of fake news and its impact in elections and referendums are introduced. The first approach, based on the idea of a representative voter, is shown to be suitable for obtaining a qualitative understanding of phenomena associated with fake news at a macroscopic level. The second approach, based on the idea of an election microstructure, describes the collective behaviour of the electorate by modelling the preferences of individual voters. It is shown through a simulation study that the mere knowledge that fake news may be in circulation goes a long way towards mitigating the impact of fake news. ... : Version to appear as Chapter 18 in Financial Informatics: An Information-Based Approach to Asset Pricing.

To address lack of studies on how fake news during natural disaster is handled through working process of news and fact-check professionals in Indonesia, this study aims to examine how fake news during natural disaster were handled by news and fact-check professionals in Indonesia. Primarily built from multilevel analyses of Hierarchy of Influences Model (HOI), this study analyzed four dimensions that shaped news information. Key codes for this study are under individual factors (i.e. personal trait and professional value), routine (i.e. information gathering, information processing, information distribution and fact-checking), organizational factors (i.e. editorial policies and organizational culture) and social institution (government and third party fact-checking organization). Through a mixed-method approach, web-observation examines the information flow of selected Palu fake news cases to provide overview on development of each case, including responses from government, media, fact-check organizations and the public. Next, in-depth interview will examine how news professionals from both traditional news media and web-only news media along with how third party fact-checkers handled Palu fake news. Theoretically, this study expands HOI\\u2019s multilevel applications to investigate how news and fact-check professionals in Indonesia handled Palu fake news. Practically, the findings will shed light for news and fact-check professionals to assess and improve their practices in handling fake news.

However, the performance of such techniques generally drops if news records are coming from different domains (e.g., politics, entertainment), especially for domains that are unseen or rarely-seen during training. As motivation, we empirically show that news records from different domains have significantly different word usage and propagation patterns.

Therefore, social media users should not simply believe the information they received. This paper investigates the process of evaluating news on social media carried out by students in assessing the news they find on social media, and their ability to distinguish factual and false news. Purpose: It is to find out more about the process of students evaluating news on social media by assessing the news they found on social media, and how can they know which is the factual news and which is the fake news. Method: This research uses qualitative research methods with a descriptive approach. This research was conducted at Gadjah Mada University. The purposive sampling technique was chosen to be used in determining participants. Findings: Overall, participants were able to identify almost all news articles. Participants are able to identify almost all factual news articles correctly and most fake news articles correctly. Only a small portion of all news articles cannot be correctly identified by participants. Participants are better to identify factual news than fake news. Conclusion: Although participants already have experience in finding fake news on social media and have self-taught knowledge about how to distinguish fake news from reliable news, this is no guarantee that they can tell the news article they got fake news or factual news. The researcher wants to give advice to the academic library to provide training on the characteristics of reliable referral sources and to think critically in assessing information as part of student information literacy training.\",\"published_in\":\"Record and Library Journal, Vol 6, Iss 2, Pp 136-145 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"fake news; social media; evaluating; students; Bibliography.

We compare the results of the two methods on four corpora. We find a positive correlation between the vagueness and subjectivity measures obtained by VAGO, and the classification of text as biased by FAKE-CLF. The comparison yields mutual benefits: VAGO helps explain the results of FAKE-CLF. Conversely FAKE-CLF helps us corroborate and expand VAGO's database. The use of two complementary techniques (rule-based vs data-driven) proves a fruitful approach for the challenging problem of identifying fake news. ... : Paper to appear in the Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Information Fusion.

This study adopts a mixed-method approach to explore fake-news sharing behaviour. To begin with, qualitative data from 58 open-ended essays was analysed to identify six behavioural manifestations associated with sharing fake news. Thereafter, research model hypothesizing the association between these behaviours was proposed using the honeycomb framework and the third-person effect hypothesis. Age and gender were the control variables. Two data sets obtained from cross-sectional surveys with 471 and 374 social media users were utilized to test the proposed model. The study results suggest that instantaneous sharing of news for creating awareness had positive effect on sharing fake news due to lack of time and religiosity. However, authenticating news before sharing had no effect on sharing fake news due to lack of time and religiosity. The study results also suggest that social media users who engage in active corrective action are unlikely to share fake news due to lack of time. These results have significant theoretical and practical implications. ; Peer reviewed\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"518 Media and communications; 511 Economics; fake news; Fake-news sharing behaviour; Honeycomb framework; Mixed-methods research; Third-person effect; PERCEPTIONS; censorship; impact; REAL; Mixed-method research; Social media\",\"subject\":\" fake news; Fake-news sharing behaviour; Honeycomb framework; Mixed-methods research; Third-person effect; PERCEPTIONS; censorship; impact; REAL; Mixed-method research; Social media\",\"authors\":\"Talwar, Shalini; Dhir, Amandeep; Singh, Dilraj; Virk, Gurnam; Salo, Jari\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10138\\/320397\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"133c84c4146eadc77bd511be0c118c48de164516bd09d8c78702ef0b5a6d5068\",\"relevance\":68,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"151add018353501e9096dc21759eae66477690b371cf0ff8a752cb963de7bd82\",\"relation\":\"New Media & Society; Chris J Vargo, Lei Guo, Michelle A Amazeen. 2017. \\\"The agenda-setting power of fake news: A big data analysis of the online media landscape from 2014 to 2016.\\\" New Media & Society, Vol 20, Issue 5, pp. 2028 - 2049. https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1461444817712086; 1461-4448; 1461-7315; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2144\\/27152; doi:10.1177\\/1461444817712086\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2144\\/27152; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1461444817712086\",\"title\":\"The agenda-setting power of fake news: A big data analysis of the online media landscape from 2014 to 2016\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The definitive publisher-authenticated version: \\\"Chris J Vargo, Lei Guo, Michelle A Amazeen. 2017. \\\"The agenda-setting power of fake news: A big data analysis of the online media landscape from 2014 to 2016.\\\" New Media & Society, Vol 20, Issue 5, pp. 2028 - 2049\\\" is available online at: https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1461444817712086. ; This study examines the agenda-setting power of fake news and fact-checkers who fight them through a computational look at the online mediascape from 2014 to 2016. Although our study confirms that content from fake news websites is increasing, these sites do not exert excessive power. Instead, fake news has an intricately entwined relationship with online partisan media, both responding and setting its issue agenda. In 2016, partisan media appeared to be especially susceptible to the agendas of fake news, perhaps due to the election. Emerging news media are also responsive to the agendas of fake news, but to a lesser degree. Fake news coverage itself is diverging and becoming more autonomous topically. While fact-checkers are autonomous in their selection of issues to cover, they were not influential in determining the agenda of news media overall, and their influence appears to be declining, illustrating the difficulties fact-checkers face in disseminating their corrections.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017-06-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"Film; television and digital media; Communication and media studies; Communication & media studies; Big data; Computational social science; Fact-checking; Fake news; Intermedia agenda setting; Journalism; Misinformation; Network agenda setting; Partisanship\",\"subject\":\"Film; television and digital media; Communication and media studies; Communication & media studies; Big data; Computational social science; Fact-checking; Fake news; Intermedia agenda setting; Journalism; Misinformation; Network agenda setting; Partisanship\",\"authors\":\"Vargo, Chris J.; Guo, Lei; Amazeen, Michelle A.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2144\\/27152\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"151add018353501e9096dc21759eae66477690b371cf0ff8a752cb963de7bd82\",\"relevance\":67,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e5fbdbc561f8f729549636a2c8eda78470ea40a19ada25e7be8977c4298f2eb5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/worldofmedia.ru\\/volumes\\/2021\\/World%20of%20Media_2-2021-35-55.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2307-1605; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2686-8016; doi:10.30547\\/worldofmedia.2.2021.2; 2307-1605; 2686-8016; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/bf90116c8f494fc19c663637aaa84cb2\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.30547\\/worldofmedia.2.2021.2; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/bf90116c8f494fc19c663637aaa84cb2\",\"title\":\"The what, how and why of fake news: An overview\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article examines the nature of the origin, definitions and functional principles of so-called fake news \\u2013 reports that are deliberately false in nature which can create a stir in society around a non-existent informational case born of the same news source.

This article answers two research questions, namely (1) Is the dissemination of fake news supported by machines through the automatic construction of filter bubbles, and (2) Are echo chambers of fake news man-made, and if yes, what are the information behavior patterns of those individuals reacting to fake news? We discuss the role of filter bubbles by analyzing social media\\u2019s ranking and results\\u2019 presentation algorithms. To understand the roles of individuals in the process of making and cultivating echo chambers, we empirically study the effects of fake news on the information behavior of the audience, while working with a case study, applying quantitative and qualitative content analysis of online comments and replies (on a blog and on Reddit). Indeed, we found hints on filter bubbles; however, they are fed by the users\\u2019 information behavior and only amplify users\\u2019 behavioral patterns. Reading fake news and eventually drafting a comment or a reply may be the result of users\\u2019 selective exposure to information leading to a confirmation bias; i.e. users prefer news (including fake news) fitting their pre-existing opinions. However, it is not possible to explain all information behavior patterns following fake news with the theory of selective exposure, but with a variety of further individual cognitive structures, such as non-argumentative or off-topic behavior, denial, moral outrage, meta-comments, insults, satire, and creation of a new rumor.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Information Science Theory and Practice, Vol 7, Iss 2, Pp 40-53 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"fake news; truth; information behavior; social media; filter bubble; echo chamber; Bibliography.

Anti-fake news legislation focuses on the transmission of information by electronic means than print media. The analysis is carried out for each of the member states by including a clause-by-clause examination of the legislation and subsequent cases addressing legal issues associated with the laws. Several common factors should be addressed to provide a fairer and more transparent approach, including developing a clear-cut definition of fake news. Two key elements should be met in the definition of spreading of fake news: it should be the intentional spreading of misinformation or disinformation by design. The research suggests it would be better to develop anti-fake news legislation as either a standalone statute or a specific amendment to existing legislation than include fake news in omnibus legislation. Except in the most serious cases, creating, publishing, or distributing fake news illegality should be reduced from a criminal offence to an administrative offence, where the police issue a fine.

As such, fake news can distort reality and cause social problems, such as self-misdiagnosis of medical issues. Many academic researchers have been collecting data from social and medical media, which are sources of various information flows, and conducting studies to analyse and detect fake news. However, in the case of conventional studies, the features used for analysis are limited, and the consideration for newly added features of social media is lacking. Therefore, this study proposes a fake news analysis modelling method by identifying a variety of features and collecting various data from Twitter, a social media outlet with a good deal of power in terms of spreading information. The method proposed in this study can increase the accuracy of fake news analysis by acquiring more potential information from the Quote Retweet feature added to Twitter in 2015, compared to the more conventional and common Retweet only. Furthermore, fake news was analysed through neural network-based classification modelling by using the preprocessed data and the identified best features in the learning data. In the performance results, using the neural network-based classifier, the classification model that also used Quote Retweet, showed an improvement in performance over the conventional methods, and it was confirmed that the identified best features had a significant impact on increasing the classification accuracy of fake news.\",\"published_in\":\"Electronics, Vol 8, Iss 12, p 1377 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"fake news; rumor; quote retweet; social media; twitter; data analysis; Electronics; TK7800-8360\",\"subject\":\"fake news; rumor; quote retweet; social media; twitter; data analysis; Electronics; \",\"authors\":\"Yonghun Jang; Chang-Hyeon Park; Yeong-Seok Seo\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/electronics8121377\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"eda33ffd7385e8cb04c8bd8d7abd1e7cb0ceceb95b71b9c6df8b4581a15ad64d\",\"relevance\":56,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/electronics8121377\"},{\"id\":\"3b842e4a4c0676354ead552bcd7f7f76f7fac8d160319bff6aa249cd663861dd\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.uny.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jss\\/article\\/view\\/25233; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1858-2656; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2721-4036; 1858-2656; 2721-4036; doi:10.21831\\/jss.v15i2.25233; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6cd556aff391463585afd45dbeeadc23\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21831\\/jss.v15i2.25233; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6cd556aff391463585afd45dbeeadc23\",\"title\":\"Detecting and combating fake news on web 2.0 technology in the 2019 political season Indonesia\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The digital age has come with lots of misinformation on the internet (web 2.0).

When leveraging emotional signals, the existing methods focus on exploiting the emotions of news contents that conveyed by the publishers (i.e., publisher emotion). However, fake news often evokes high-arousal or activating emotions of people, so the emotions of news comments aroused in the crowd (i.e., social emotion) should not be ignored. Furthermore, it remains to be explored whether there exists a relationship between publisher emotion and social emotion (i.e., dual emotion), and how the dual emotion appears in fake news.

The dissemination of this type of news poses a serious threat to cohesion and social well-being, since it fosters political polarization and the distrust of people with respect to their leaders. The huge amount of news that is disseminated through social media makes manual verification unfeasible, which has promoted the design and implementation of automatic systems for fake news detection. The creators of fake news use various stylistic tricks to promote the success of their creations, with one of them being to excite the sentiments of the recipients. This has led to sentiment analysis, the part of text analytics in charge of determining the polarity and strength of sentiments expressed in a text, to be used in fake news detection approaches, either as a basis of the system or as a complementary element. In this article, we study the different uses of sentiment analysis in the detection of fake news, with a discussion of the most relevant elements and shortcomings, and the requirements that should be met in the near future, such as multilingualism, explainability, mitigation of biases, or treatment of multimedia elements.\",\"published_in\":\"Electronics, Vol 10, Iss 1348, p 1348 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"sentiment analysis; opinion mining; fake news; social media; Electronics; TK7800-8360\",\"subject\":\"sentiment analysis; opinion mining; fake news; social media; Electronics; \",\"authors\":\"Miguel A.

Gatekeeping theory of the media was used as theoretical framework for arguments and discourse in the work. Through purposive sampling, 18 in-depth interviews were conducted among journalists in Jos and new media scholars in the department of Mass Communication, University of Jos. Results of the study revealed that the views of journalists and media scholars on fake news were unanimous. However, while journalists were of the opinion that fake news affects journalism negatively, media scholars had mixed reactions that fake news affects journalism positively. It was also revealed that there are no standard measures by media professionals or other regulatory bodies to counter fake news which implies very little gatekeeping especially in most online news sources. The study thus recommended, among other, that offenders should be sanctioned and all registered and licensed media organizations should step up their gatekeeping roles while registration should be extended to bloggers and other independent media entrepreneurs.\",\"published_in\":\"Studies in Aesthetics & Art Criticism; Vol. 1 No. 2 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2022-06-08\",\"subject_orig\":\"fake news; online news; perception; journalism and gatekeeping\",\"subject\":\"fake news; online news; perception; journalism and gatekeeping\",\"authors\":\"Habib, Gift Sadiat; Akila, Mabas Amos\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/royalliteglobal.com\\/saac\\/article\\/view\\/827\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"38f49b9a2f1df3f52d4ea45ffe6f0ab9411202f2217b04734885287a73414970\",\"relevance\":35,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"b0e8bb50e784d6466f6470fdc6b88ac4e0143067d29d73c970fb19813cd22903\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu\\/article\\/research-note-the-scale-of-facebooks-problem-depends-upon-how-fake-news-is-classified\\/; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2766-1652; doi:10.37016\\/mr-2020-43; 2766-1652; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/26fe949eb41644bab852706553032a6d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.37016\\/mr-2020-43; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/26fe949eb41644bab852706553032a6d\",\"title\":\"Research note: The scale of Facebook\\u2019s problem depends upon how \\u2018fake news\\u2019 is classified\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Ushering in the contemporary \\u2018fake news\\u2019 crisis, Craig Silverman of Buzzfeed News reported that it outperformed mainstream news on Facebook in the three months prior to the 2016 US presidential elections.

Given the inherent human tendency to share information with their social connections at a mouse-click, fake news articles masquerading as real ones, tend to spread widely and virally. The presence of echo chambers (people sharing same beliefs) in social networks, only adds to this problem of wide-spread existence of fake news on social media.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DHGNN) for fake news quick detection.

Their model focuses on the relationship between the creator and the consumer of fake news and proposes a mechanism by which to determine how likely users may be to share fake news with others.

The implications reach into many well-established avenues of inquiry in education, Library and Information Science (LIS), sociology, and other disciplines, including communities of practice, information acquiring and sharing, social positioning, social capital theory, self-determination, rational choice (e.g., satisficing and information overload), critical thinking, and information literacy.

Fact checking might help combat fake news and a plethora of fact-checking platforms exist, yet few people actually use them. Moreover, whether fact checking is effective in preventing citizens from falling for fake news, particularly COVID-19 related, is unclear. Against this backdrop, we examine potential antecedents to fact checking that can be a target for interventions and establish that fact checking is actually effective for preventing the public from falling for harmful COVID-19 fake news. We use a representative U.S. sample collected in April of 2020 and find that awareness of fake news and patterns of active SM use (e.g., commenting on content instead of reading it) increases the fact checking of COVID-19 fake news, whereas SM homophily reduces fact checking and the effects of SM use as users are trapped in echo chambers. We also find that fact checking helps users identify accurate information on how to protect themselves against COVID-19 instead of false and often harmful claims propagated on SM.

The increased proliferation of fake news has been observed since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started, thus introducing controversy regarding its origin, conspiracies about 5G causing COVID-19 and COVID-19 home remedies or prevention methods. This information may be harmless, or could potentially pose a threat by misleading the population to depend on unjustified and unsubstantiated claims. Several studies worldwide are investing towards this topic, however, very little has been done in the South African context. Therefore, this study aims at analysing fake news about COVID-19 spread during the South African national lockdown on social media platforms and news outlets; together with the measures put in place by the government i.e. social relief funds and food parcels. This study took place between March 2020 and October 2020 whereby a Google form was used to collect data. The collected data was verified using fact-checking websites like Africa Check and techniques such as Google reverse image for image verification. Thereafter, the data was coded according to these categories, namely; misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, propaganda and scams, and annotated according to 11 annotation classes. The analysis showed that Twitter was the leading source of fake news at 59% followed by WhatsApp at 22%. In addition, most discussions were in reference to COVID-19 cures and treatments. Overtime, a correlation was observed between events (e.g., change in regulations) that occurred and the spread of fake news. To dispel and delegitimise the sources, a publicly accessible dashboard was created where all verified fake news were shared for easier access. This study has established an understanding of the nature of fake news and draws insights that offer practical guidance on how fake news may be combated in the future. ; 66-84 ; \\u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Understanding the gratifications and personality traits of individuals sharing fake news on social media platforms\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose \\u201cFake news\\u201d or misinformation sharing using social media sites into public discourse or politics has increased dramatically, over the last few years, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic causing concern. However, this phenomenon is inadequately researched. This study examines fake news sharing with the lens of stimulus-organism-response (SOR) theory, uses and gratification theory (UGT) and big five personality traits (BFPT) theory to understand the motivations for sharing fake news and the personality traits that do so. The stimuli in the model comprise gratifications (pass time, entertainment, socialization, information sharing and information seeking) and personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness and neuroticism). The feeling of authenticating or instantly sharing news is the organism leading to sharing fake news, which forms the response in the study. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The conceptual model was tested by the data collected from a sample of 221 social media users in India. The data were analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling to determine the effects of UGT and personality traits on fake news sharing. The moderating role of the platform WhatsApp or Facebook was studied. Findings The results suggest that pass time, information sharing and socialization gratifications lead to instant sharing news on social media platforms. Individuals who exhibit extraversion, neuroticism and openness share news on social media platforms instantly. In contrast, agreeableness and conscientiousness personality traits lead to authentication news before sharing on the social media platform. Originality\\/value This study contributes to social media literature by identifying the user gratifications and personality traits that lead to sharing fake news on social media platforms. Furthermore, the study also sheds light on the moderating influence of the choice of the social media platform for fake news sharing.\",\"published_in\":\"Aslib Journal of Information Management ; ISSN 2050-3806\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"Library and Information Sciences; Information Systems\",\"subject\":\"Library and Information Sciences; Information Systems\",\"authors\":\"Sampat, Brinda; Raj, Sahil\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/ajim-08-2021-0232\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"82ab12367b0e7409c216d50d5e82ff68f6196bf3b36c73069dd364c41b2136bb\",\"relevance\":13,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/ajim-08-2021-0232\"},{\"id\":\"db119ab2e0dafacab17120b5cbc53c92214ef1ec8365d0ffbd0c7084b9e843e8\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.2012.04233; https:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/abs\\/2012.04233\",\"title\":\"Early Detection of Fake News by Utilizing the Credibility of News, Publishers, and Users Based on Weakly Supervised Learning ...\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The dissemination of fake news significantly affects personal reputation and public trust. Recently, fake news detection has attracted tremendous attention, and previous studies mainly focused on finding clues from news content or diffusion path. However, the required features of previous models are often unavailable or insufficient in early detection scenarios, resulting in poor performance. Thus, early fake news detection remains a tough challenge. Intuitively, the news from trusted and authoritative sources or shared by many users with a good reputation is more reliable than other news. Using the credibility of publishers and users as prior weakly supervised information, we can quickly locate fake news in massive news and detect them in the early stages of dissemination. In this paper, we propose a novel Structure-aware Multi-head Attention Network (SMAN), which combines the news content, publishing, and reposting relations of publishers and users, to jointly optimize the fake news detection and ... : Accepted as a long paper at COLING 2020 ...\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Computation and Language cs.CL; Social and Information Networks cs.SI; FOS Computer and information sciences\",\"subject\":\"Computation and ; CL; Social and Information ; SI; FOS Computer and information sciences\",\"authors\":\"Yuan, Chunyuan; Ma, Qianwen; Zhou, Wei; Han, Jizhong; Hu, Songlin\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.2012.04233\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"db119ab2e0dafacab17120b5cbc53c92214ef1ec8365d0ffbd0c7084b9e843e8\",\"relevance\":12,\"resulttype\":[\"Report\",\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.2012.04233\"},{\"id\":\"2e140dd2c3f0193ef950ac7f132f600285132d136b867603e6ed72be79226bc9\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/3512936; https:\\/\\/dl.acm.org\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1145\\/3512936\",\"title\":\"Examining Source Effects on Perceptions of Fake News in Rural India\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper presents a between-subjects design experiment with 478 people in India to investigate how rural and urban social media users perceive credible and fake posts, and how different types of sources impact their perceptions of information credibility and sharing behaviors. Our findings reveal that: (1) rural social media users were less adept in differentiating between credible and fake posts than their urban counterparts, and (2) source effects on trust and sharing intent manifested differently for urban and rural users. For example, fake posts from family members garnered greater trust among urban users but were trusted the least by rural users. In case of sharing Facebook posts, urban users were more willing to share fake posts from family, whereas, rural users were more inclined to share fake posts from journalists. Drawing on these findings, we propose design interventions to counteract fake news in low-resource environments of the Global South.\",\"published_in\":\"Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction ; volume 6, issue CSCW1, page 1-29 ; ISSN 2573-0142\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"Computer Networks and Communications; Human-Computer Interaction; Social Sciences (miscellaneous)\",\"subject\":\"Computer Networks and Communications; Human-Computer Interaction; Social Sciences (miscellaneous)\",\"authors\":\"Shahid, Farhana; Mare, Shrirang; Vashistha, Aditya\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/3512936\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"2e140dd2c3f0193ef950ac7f132f600285132d136b867603e6ed72be79226bc9\",\"relevance\":11,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/3512936\"},{\"id\":\"d924f230dd4aeadfd277f735e5b84f5a2722e95e7ebf9993ffeb3da881f20ed7\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1515\\/opis-2019-0013; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2451-1781; 2451-1781; doi:10.1515\\/opis-2019-0013; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6807cb66e43f421eb5b9577767975172\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1515\\/opis-2019-0013; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6807cb66e43f421eb5b9577767975172\",\"title\":\"Information ACTism in \\u201cTrumping\\u201d the Contemporary Fake News Phenomenon in Rural Libraries\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Fabricated or fake news has become a phenomenon of unprecedented proportions in the 21st century.

Currently, there are many definitions of fake news, but the professional community cannot fully agree on a single one, what creates a big problem for their detection. Many large IT companies, such as Google and Facebook, are developing their own algorithms to protect the public from informational falsification. At the same time, the lack of a common approach to understanding the essence of fake news makes the solution of this issue ideologically impossible.

Science and medicine are deeply affected by this increasing phenomenon. Critical care represents a hot spot for fake news due to the high risk of conflictive communication, the rapid turnaround of clinical news and high prevalence of unpleasant information. Communication with patients\\u2019 relatives is one of the hardest aspects. The relationship between physicians and families is pivotal to improve relatives\\u2019 comfort, and reduce anxiety and pain. Fake news may undermine this relationship, posing an alternative truth between the critical care physician and relatives, which must be countered without worsening their suffering. The aim of this review is to provide intensivists an overview of concepts, characteristics and risk to better understand the fake news phenomenon and counter its potentially devastating effects.\",\"published_in\":\"Anaesthesiology Intensive Therapy, Vol 52, Iss 1, Pp 42-46 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"critical care; communication; emotional distress; fake news; Anesthesiology; RD78.3-87.3; Medical emergencies.

Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user comments. We develop a novel neural network based model, M ulti- V iew A ttention N etworks (MVAN) to detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods by 2.5&#x0025; in accuracy on average, and produce a reasonable explanation.\",\"published_in\":\"IEEE Access, Vol 9, Pp 106907-106917 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fake news detection; graph attention networks; attention; deep learning; social media; Electrical engineering.

In the last few years, social media has turned out to be a massive player in shaping public discourse in a democratic space (Marda & Milan, 2018). Though there have been pressures from policymakers on service\\/platform providers, nothing concrete has built up towards accountability of the user or platform proprietors. In India, there has been a consistent increase of social media users and instances of the misuse of this medium. This paper seeks to examine how the propagation of fake news has disrupted the public sphere and possible policies that can be implemented to curb the plague of fake news. The relationship between various events of violence reported in India media and the role of fake news in instigating chaos are discussed in this paper. It also tries to review policies initiatives taken by various countries, especially in Europe and possible measures which India could take to restrict the flow of fake news.\",\"published_in\":\"Media Watch ; 10 ; 3 ; 737-750\",\"year\":\"2021-08-12T12:57:09Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Publizistische Medien; Journalismus,Verlagswesen; News media; journalism; publishing; Facebook; fake news; India; media law; policy; social media; WhatsApp; Medieninhalte; Aussagenforschung; Media Contents; Content Analysis; 10800\",\"subject\":\"Publizistische Medien; Journalismus, Verlagswesen; News media; journalism; publishing; Facebook; fake news; India; media law; policy; social media; WhatsApp; Medieninhalte; Aussagenforschung; Media Contents; Content Analysis;\",\"authors\":\"Balili, Aasita; Desai, Prathik\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ssoar.info\\/ssoar\\/handle\\/document\\/74358\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"59cac157500ceb1d151b6d0fea5bfebccd13cbb691080a57eb31222320ed7141\",\"relevance\":6,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2302d5107d169072c812e302f945b15f9f6a71354033ca1f2073ba84dd56d13a\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/3386253; https:\\/\\/dl.acm.org\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1145\\/3386253\",\"title\":\"FNED ; A Deep Network for Fake News Early Detection on Social Media\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The fast spreading of fake news stories on social media can cause inestimable social harm. Developing effective methods to detect them early is of paramount importance. A major challenge of fake news early detection is fully utilizing the limited data observed at the early stage of news propagation and then learning useful patterns from it for identifying fake news. In this article, we propose a novel deep neural network to detect fake news early. It has three novel components: (1) a status-sensitive crowd response feature extractor that extracts both text features and user features from combinations of users\\u2019 text response and their corresponding user profiles, (2) a position-aware attention mechanism that highlights important user responses at specific ranking positions, and (3) a multi-region mean-pooling mechanism to perform feature aggregation based on multiple window sizes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model can detect fake news with greater than 90% accuracy within 5 minutes after it starts to spread and before it is retweeted 50 times, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art baselines. Most importantly, our approach requires only 10% labeled fake news samples to achieve this effectiveness under PU-Learning settings.\",\"published_in\":\"ACM Transactions on Information Systems ; volume 38, issue 3, page 1-33 ; ISSN 1046-8188 1558-2868\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Computer Science Applications; General Business, Management and Accounting; Information Systems\",\"subject\":\"Computer Science Applications; General Business, Management and Accounting; Information Systems\",\"authors\":\"Liu, Yang; Wu, Yi-Fang Brook\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/3386253\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"2302d5107d169072c812e302f945b15f9f6a71354033ca1f2073ba84dd56d13a\",\"relevance\":5,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/3386253\"},{\"id\":\"93a1ccab33e48b7577eda38e2348d0ab22acab8f2688f1468291c4e0c72b3018\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/01655515221087683; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/01655515221087683; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/01655515221087683\",\"title\":\"SceneFND: Multimodal fake news detection by modelling scene context information\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Fake news is a threat for the society and can create a lot of confusion to people regarding what is true and what not. Fake news usually contain manipulated content, such as text or images that attract the interest of the readers with the aim to convince them on their truthfulness. In this article, we propose SceneFND (Scene Fake News Detection), a system that combines textual, contextual scene and visual representation to address the problem of multimodal fake news detection. The textual representation is based on word embeddings that are passed into a bidirectional long short-term memory network. Both the contextual scene and the visual representations are based on the images contained in the news post. The place, weather and season scenes are extracted from the image. Our statistical analysis on the scenes showed that there are statistically significant differences regarding their frequency in fake and real news. In addition, our experimental results on two real world datasets show that the integration of the contextual scenes is effective for fake news detection. In particular, SceneFND improved the performance of the textual baseline by 3.48% in PolitiFact and by 3.32% in GossipCop datasets. Finally, we show the suitability of the scene information for the task and present some examples to explain its effectiveness in capturing the relevance between images and text.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Information Science ; page 016555152210876 ; ISSN 0165-5515 1741-6485\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"Library and Information Sciences; Information Systems\",\"subject\":\"Library and Information Sciences; Information Systems\",\"authors\":\"Zhang, Guobiao; Giachanou, Anastasia; Rosso, Paolo\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/01655515221087683\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"93a1ccab33e48b7577eda38e2348d0ab22acab8f2688f1468291c4e0c72b3018\",\"relevance\":3,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/01655515221087683\"}]",
