In Lithuania, before the COVID-19 pandemic, distance education in preschool education, which is meant to prepare a child for school, was not applied, there were no specific guidelines, tested teaching platforms or pedagogic practices. The study deals with the results of focus groups research performed in June 2020, designated for discussing of experiences of the Lithuanian preschool education institutions in distance education gained during the quarantine (from 16\\/03\\/2020 to 29\\/05\\/2020). The performed analysis of experiences in the organisation of distant education in preschool education disclosed the essential challenges faced when applying this form of education in the education of six-year-old children. It has been established that the key challenges organizing distance education in preschool education are related to the lack of the IT solutions for distance education; the readiness of the participants of the education process for distance education and engagement in suchprocess of education, as well as the lack of support from national and regional institutions in the organisation of distance education. The results of research open possibilities for further researches, which are necessary for efficient and sustainable distance education integration into preschool education. In this context, explicit, deep research related to the analysis of appropriateness of distance education platforms in the early stage of age, search for didactic solutions of digital content for them and deep research into concrete implementation cases is necessary.\",\"published_in\":\"Digital Education Review; No 40 (2021); 141-153 ; Digital Education Review; No. 40 (2021): Number 40, December 2021; 141-153 ; Digital Education Review; N\\u00fam. 40 (2021): N\\u00famero 40, diciembre 2021; 141-153 ; 2013-9144\",\"year\":\"2021-12-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"Preschool education; organisation of education; distance education; COVID-19\",\"subject\":\"Preschool education; organisation of education; distance education; \",\"authors\":\"Railien\\u0117, Asta; Merfeldaite, Odeta; Prakapas, Romas\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/revistes.ub.edu\\/index.php\\/der\\/article\\/view\\/32971\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"1139076037b91cd4a577353b4e6f0250053b6c16d63f47728a271851554e5890\",\"relevance\":468,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2ac33f3c2c463cc8a18ee244aa3d79073a310097800cc1eefad4e578a22efb4c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/repl.gianfj.com\\/index.php\\/jldhe\\/article\\/view\\/489; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1759-667X; doi:10.47408\\/jldhe.v0i14.489; 1759-667X; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/27bfab4308a74f018de2586176faf170\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.47408\\/jldhe.v0i14.489; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/27bfab4308a74f018de2586176faf170\",\"title\":\"Making use of students' digital habits in higher education: What they already know and what they learn\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Varieties of digital practices have increasingly become part of people\\u2019s everyday lives and people, in general, use these communicative practices on a daily basis, mostly for social and entertaining purposes. As to higher education, researchers have pointed out that digital technology could be a useful tool in how to learn more effectively, if it is based on the abilities that students bring with them into higher education from their everyday life (for example, Buzzard et. al., 2011). In this case study, we explore the issue of students' digital practices in everyday life as well as in higher education, in a teacher training programme at a Swedish University. The aim is two-fold: on the one hand, to provide knowledge regarding students' everyday experiences of digital practices and the ways in which these are utilised in higher education; on the other hand, to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which higher education contributes to challenging and developing students' digital skills. Twenty-nine students from teacher training programmes participated in the study by answering a questionnaire. The results show that the students\\u2019 digital habits are not being used or acknowledged in higher education, except for when it comes to their Teacher Training Practice (TTP). Furthermore, the results also show that higher education contributes to students\\u2019 digital skills. This, we argue, could be of interest for teachers and researchers in teacher training programmes and for teachers in primary to tertiary education, in developing education activities with digital technology based on pupils\\u2019 and students\\u2019 digital habits. We can also see that the study can inspire other teachers in higher education, where the idea of using students\\u2019 digital habits perhaps is not yet taken into consideration.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Learning Development in Higher Education, Iss 14 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital technology; higher education; teacher training practice; digital habits; digital skills; digital environment; Theory and practice of education; LB5-3640\",\"subject\":\"digital technology; higher education; teacher training practice; digital habits; digital skills; digital environment; Theory and practice of education; \",\"authors\":\"Eva Hansson; Jeanette Sj\\u00f6berg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.47408\\/jldhe.v0i14.489\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"2ac33f3c2c463cc8a18ee244aa3d79073a310097800cc1eefad4e578a22efb4c\",\"relevance\":466,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.47408\\/jldhe.v0i14.489\"},{\"id\":\"ae1fa2b40f8ba29f93fc6752a745c62ca31ffcc9b9d895d409841e92b7e2a652\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.5095069; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/communities\\/paee-ale; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/5095070; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.5095070; oai:zenodo.org:5095070\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/5095070; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.5095070\",\"title\":\"Management of digital transformation of educational technology: key elements\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The aim of this paper is to provide insight into the key elements of management of digital transformation of educational technology and to suggest avenues for future study.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the mediating role of digital informal learning between higher education students' digital competence and their academic performance. The data were collected from 319 students from Shiraz University in Iran. Data were analysed using structural equation modeling via AMOS.

The main constraints to digital innovation in Portuguese higher education teaching are the limited infrastructure and resources, a conservative academic culture, a lack of funding opportunities, insufficient technological resources and technical support. ; publishersversion ; published\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital innovation; Higher education; Infrastructure; Faculty; Digital practices; SDG 9 - Industry; Innovation; and Infrastructure\",\"subject\":\"Digital innovation; Higher education; Infrastructure; Faculty; Digital practices; SDG 9 - Industry; Innovation; and Infrastructure\",\"authors\":\"Vicente, Paulo Nuno; Lucas, Margarida; Carlos, V\\u00e2nia\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10362\\/111515\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"98a2f932b163e0bea7e5b167ffb2b4bb9a05fcda26f61eff76621a9945990445\",\"relevance\":445,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"6e5c33950da59b9c3a4a201b96967167dc1c32fe44ccf620f1bda313cf247c99\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/pure.au.dk\\/portal\\/da\\/publications\\/patterns-of-inclusion(97148134-d8c5-4d9d-8fd9-394586d09bef).html; https:\\/\\/pure.au.dk\\/ws\\/files\\/120071921\\/Pedersen_et_al_2018_Patterns_of_Inclusion.pdf\",\"title\":\"Patterns of inclusion:fostering digital citizenship through hybrid education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Reconsidering the concept of digital citizenship and the essential component of education the authors propose that the concept of Hybrid Education may serve both as a guideline for the utilization of digital technologies in education and as a methodology for fostering new forms of participation, inclusion and engagement in society. Following T.H.

The paper presents a theory-based, value driven and practical orientated framework for innovation in education. The paper documents a process where participants situated around the globe worked in collaboration with a group of participants gathered at a workshop on the concept of hybridity in education and on identifying and describing educational patterns for Hybrid Education that are directly applicable in relation to the concept of digital citizenship. The process introduces a value-based and vision-driven design pattern approach to innovation in education by framing and aligning values and visions of the participants. This work resulted in approximately 85 unique pattern candidates that address various aspects of hybridity in education.

Educating them and bringing them into society is one of the most fundamental tasks of a nation. The disadvantageous position that individuals with a disability are exposed to shows the importance of the need for inclusive education for the quality of life. It is important to use the merits of digital transformation to provide services and education for all to support sustainability. This research aims to shine a light on the problems related to inclusive education faced in the special education schools and rehabilitation centers and put forward suggestions for digital transformation. As inclusive means inclusion, social interaction, access, and equality for education, the role of digital transformation is examined for the quality of inclusive education. Self-reflection is a qualitative form which was employed in the research involving school managers and teachers who were selected randomly from the Special Education Schools and Rehabilitation Centers that participated in the research. It is revealed that most of the studies focus on inclusive education, the digital divide, social inclusion, online learning, and the implication of inclusive education in digital transformation. Although studies expose inclusive education in digital transformation, most of these have 0.20 quality criteria, showing an intensified need to extend the existing body of knowledge. It is shown that the vast majority of inclusive education aligns with the institution\\u2019s inclusive education vision and purpose. Concerning financing, it is difficult to find sponsors among non-governmental organizations to support the institution\\u2019s inclusive education-related material, equipment, and security needs, and Ministry of National Education funding is essential. There is a need to improve the inclusive education competencies of administrators and teachers, and in-service training should be provided.

One of the relevant concepts, digital citizenship can be defined as applying and advocating behaviors necessary for legal, ethical, safe, and responsible use of info-communication technologies in online settings (ISTE, 2007). Day by day, individuals are becoming more and more digital citizens with the spread of the Internet and digital communication devices. However, this gives rise to discussions about problems related with ethics, privacy and security, health, communication, and etc. (Symantec, 2010; Deniz, 2010; Kadll, Kumba & Kanamad, 2010; Gunduz & Ozdinc, 2008; Kabakci & Can, 2009).

METHODS: We completed a systematic review of the literature by following the Cochrane methodology. We searched 7 major electronic databases for articles published from January 1990 to August 2017. No language restrictions were applied. We independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, and pairs of authors compared information. We contacted authors of studies for additional information if necessary. All pooled analyses were based on random effects models. We included individually or cluster randomized controlled trials that compared digital education with traditional learning, no intervention, or other forms of digital education. We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria. RESULTS: Twenty studies (1382 participants) were included. Participants included pediatricians, physicians, nurses, and midwives. Digital education technologies were assessed including high-fidelity mannequins (6 studies), computer-based education (12 studies), mobile learning (1 study), and virtual reality (1 study). Most studies reported that digital education was either as effective as or more effective than the control intervention for outcomes including skill, knowledge, attitude, and satisfaction. ...\",\"published_in\":\"Brusamento , S , Kyaw , B M , Whiting , P , Li , L & Tudor Car , L 2019 , ' Digital Health Professions Education in the Field of Pediatrics : Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by the Digital Health Education Collaboration ' , Journal of Medical Internet Research , vol. 21 , no. 9 , pp. e14231 . https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.2196\\/14231\",\"year\":\"2019-09-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital education; randomized controlled trials; pediatrics; systematic review; meta-analysis; traditional learning; high-fidelity mannequins\",\"subject\":\"digital education; randomized controlled trials; pediatrics; systematic review; meta-analysis; traditional learning; high-fidelity mannequins\",\"authors\":\"Brusamento, Serena; Kyaw, Bhone Myint; Whiting, Penny; Li, Li; Tudor Car, Lorainne\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1983\\/61668a6a-9176-43da-b9f6-afe345480dca\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"f7ec613ef7d7501d0ad8481e6b91845f845ea1c377d5d6ad7458df1a923654db\",\"relevance\":427,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e16a45b57b293961540d42007b71a9d382ef89cd810b5d276be8376fbfbf1785\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.medicaljournals.se\\/acta\\/content\\/html\\/10.2340\\/00015555-3068; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0001-5555; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1651-2057; 0001-5555; 1651-2057; doi:10.2340\\/00015555-3068; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/1dacee98a80d4f94ac9f09a6d6e01b31\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.2340\\/00015555-3068; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/1dacee98a80d4f94ac9f09a6d6e01b31\",\"title\":\"Digital Education for Health Professions in the Field of Dermatology: A Systematic Review by Digital Health Education Collaboration\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Digital health education is a new approach that is receiving increasing attention with advantages such as scalability and flexibility of education.

Digital technology introduces scopes that expedite blended, e-learning, and online in higher education; suggests a multiple of ways to communicate, learn, correspond, cooperate, and collaborate. Also, digital technology has been more and more widely used in higher education for the continuous development of the economy. This study replicates on the growing importance of digital technology on higher education in Bangladesh over the period 1988-2018. Besides, the study exploits the Johansen cointegration and vector error correction model (VECM) for investigating the positive relationship between digital technology and higher education. The Johansen's cointegration outcomes ascertain that digital technology, higher education, and gross domestic product are cointegrated in the long-run. Furthermore, the VECM outcomes suggest that digital technology can stimulate higher education in both the long run and short run, where learners, educators, and nations are consistently gainer of this country. The study also highlights that higher education consistently contributes to gross domestic product.

The study methodology deploys the differentiation of philosophical and scientific paradigms. Pre-digital education is associated with the classical paradigm. Accordingly, the parameters of pre-digital education include the notions of finite and true knowledge, a singular type of learning algorithms, a balanced learning process, and the deterministic influence of educational programs. The indicators of digital education are identified within the framework of the non-classical and post-non-classical paradigms. The non-classical form of digital education is characterized by the presence of alternative educational programs, the polysemantic object of study, infinite knowledge, and pragmatic orientation. This form of education accentuates the subjective and personal context, the opportunities for plural explanations, and the technologies for studying the singular, the local, and the fragmental. Digital education contributes to modeling infinite discourses and intersubjective practices. All educational innovations within digital education appear as a way of ontological and gnoseological construction. Digital education enhances the role of interdisciplinary education. The competencies of \\u201ccross-cutting\\u201d and extensive understanding of a complex subject appear. Students should be focused on the results of teaching in various disciplines. A consequence of the expanding learning opportunities is the necessary reduction of pedagogical goals and objectives.\",\"published_in\":\"SHS Web of Conferences, Vol 103, p 02003 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"pre-digital education; digital education; digital project; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"pre-digital education; digital education; digital project; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Denikin Anatoly V.; Denikina Zoya D.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1051\\/shsconf\\/202110302003\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"e79955f87a4d8f1f1bc009d4fbbe532f2d1080a1370becc05d06ef444e8ea16b\",\"relevance\":408,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1051\\/shsconf\\/202110302003\"},{\"id\":\"edd469a29ac08ef752b83a24512b2106036dd0362ad046528527039ed081130b\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ssbfnet.com\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/ijrbs\\/article\\/view\\/815\\/666; http:\\/\\/www.ssbfnet.com\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/ijrbs\\/article\\/view\\/815\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ssbfnet.com\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/ijrbs\\/article\\/view\\/815\",\"title\":\"Impact of digital technology in higher education: Perspective from Bangladesh\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In the current era, digital technology cannot be overlooked in higher education and other economic factors. Digital technology introduces scopes that expedite blended, e-learning, and online in higher education; suggests a multiple of ways to communicate, learn, correspond, cooperate, and collaborate. Also, digital technology has been more and more widely used in higher education for the continuous development of the economy. This study replicates on the growing importance of digital technology on higher education in Bangladesh over the period 1988-2018. Besides, the study exploits the Johansen cointegration and vector error correction model (VECM) for investigating the positive relationship between digital technology and higher education. The Johansen's cointegration outcomes ascertain that digital technology, higher education, and gross domestic product are cointegrated in the long-run. Furthermore, the VECM outcomes suggest that digital technology can stimulate higher education in both the long run and short run, where learners, educators, and nations are consistently gainer of this country. The study also highlights that higher education consistently contributes to gross domestic product.

However, in 2020 the transformation in South Africa was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This global health threat was inadvertently a catalyst for considerable change within the field of education. Considering that the nature of COVID-19 was infectious, the best mode of delivery for education to students during the pandemic was digital platforms. For the History Education department at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), this was a significant transition from the conventional contact methods. While digital platforms were used under normal conditions to complement contact lectures, the transition meant that all teaching was completely dependent on digital platforms. Navigating this change was both interesting and challenging for me as a teacher and supervisor of History Education. This paper is a self-study of my experiences of engaging with online History Education at postgraduate and undergraduate levels within Higher Education. History Education modules had to be re-engineered, and pedagogical considerations had to be explored to align with the use of digital software. The online transition was not seamless and was accompanied by challenges that ranged from technological inaccessibility and teacher training for online education to academic disparities. At the onset of the transition, technology proved to exacerbate existing geo-social and educational inequalities within the learning community at the UKZN\\u2019s History Education department. It undeniably took a considerable amount of time to acclimatise to the new digital platforms for online education. Eventually, there were visible successes. For instance, new online pedagogies proved effective in traversing History Education modules via online education. Training in the use of software and applications was also useful in achieving the learning objectives of History Education modules. Online resources, such as multimedia, were easier to incorporate into History Education lectures. This provided an integrative shift between theory and real-life experiences. Arguably, the COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst for embracing digital platforms, which we, as educationalists, may not have otherwise implemented were it not a necessity. ; https:\\/\\/upjournals.up.ac.za\\/index.php\\/yesterday_and_today\\/article\\/view\\/1906\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"History Education; COVID-19; Multimodal Model for Online Education; Digital platforms; Higher education; Remote learning\",\"subject\":\"History Education; Multimodal Model for Online Education; Digital platforms; Higher education; Remote learning\",\"authors\":\"Iyer, Leevina M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2263\\/80564\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"b273b353f7f966b9da37beee21db0b39522c6f75dc18e71848923e8953200d00\",\"relevance\":379,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"b42ae6b461e947d2237bb3222d2b3579dbb5d9c5f55dc6be18f1a73df9b1faf0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.idunn.no\\/dk\\/2015\\/02\\/guidelines_and_regulations_for_teaching_digital_competence_; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0809-6724; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1891-943X; 0809-6724; 1891-943X; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/141634970a3547bba0b28dd852322600\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/141634970a3547bba0b28dd852322600\",\"title\":\"Guidelines and Regulations for Teaching Digital Competence in Schools and Teacher Education: A Weak Link?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Teacher education has recently been criticised for not fulfilling its obligation to adequately prepare teachers to utilise digital tools in the classroom. In this paper, we raise the question of why Norwegian teacher education does not prepare student teachers to integrate digital tools into their teaching as required by the Norwegian curriculum. We question the formal premises governing the development of digital competence in teacher education and how they correspond with the requirements of the Norwegian national education curriculum. To gain insight into this question, we analysed how digital competence is presented in the official key documents that create the framework for teacher education, and compared them to the requirements of the Norwegian National Curriculum. Our findings indicate that there is a weak link between the curriculum and the premises for digital competence in teacher education.\",\"published_in\":\"Nordic Journal of Digital Literacy, Vol 10, Pp 69-83 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital competence; teacher education reform; national curriculum; Digitalcompetence; teachereducationreform; nationalcurriculum; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"Digital competence; teacher education reform; national curriculum; Digitalcompetence; teachereducationreform; nationalcurriculum; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"B\\u00e5rd Ketil Engen; Tonje Hilde Gi\\u00e6ver; Louise Mifsud\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/141634970a3547bba0b28dd852322600\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"b42ae6b461e947d2237bb3222d2b3579dbb5d9c5f55dc6be18f1a73df9b1faf0\",\"relevance\":377,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"f17513123bfb3097e7071ecba4cb29767cd129d34fbd3507f1054526997bee83\",\"relation\":\"Paedagogica Historica vol:50 issue:6 pages:861-870; https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/465817; 0030-9230; doi:10.1080\\/00309230.2014.955511; 1477-674X\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/465817; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/00309230.2014.955511\",\"title\":\"Towards a history of e-ducation? Exploring the possibilities of digital humanities for the history of education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"n the past few years, worries about decreasing jobs or even the possible disappearance of the history of education as a field of study have frequently surfaced. Hence, the question arises as to whether the history of education, as a field of study, has a future \\u2013 or is it, as many authors have remarked, in danger? This article starts from the idea that our field of study is definitely not alone in its struggle: many branches of the humanities have fallen victim to similar appeals of economic efficiency and relevance. In response to these developments, digital humanities in particular have been identified as a way out of the impasse. Therefore, this article explores the ways in which digital humanities or digital history can offer valuable contributions to the future of the history of education. This paper advocates that, although digital humanities or digital history cannot magically make our problems disappear, historians of education should further embrace the possibilities digital technology has to offer for the investigation of our educational past. I argue that digital technology not only has the potential to make our lives considerably easier; it can also help in addressing new research questions, give new meaning to existing concepts within the history of education and further enhance the interdisciplinary character of our discipline. ; status: published\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-09-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital history; technology; history of education\",\"subject\":\"digital history; technology; history of education\",\"authors\":\"Van Ruyskensvelde, Sarah\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/465817\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"f17513123bfb3097e7071ecba4cb29767cd129d34fbd3507f1054526997bee83\",\"relevance\":375,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"894373e32a425246f8b99bb9bf54b24cf96bdb170842a680c8ebf921fee5a083\",\"relation\":\"(Un)p\\u00e4dagogische Visionen f\\u00fcr das 21.

The new skill requirements have forced education policies and systems to adapt to these technological changes and the resulting societal needs. However, efforts to implement these adjustments face a number of practical and systemic obstacles. This article examines European Union policies addressing the matter of digital technologies in education, discusses the application of different technological tools in education and looks at the links with the fundamental right to education. It is argued that the right to education should be expanded to encompass technologically enhanced education while also recognizing that digital technologies bring both extraordinary opportunities and risks. It is further suggested that a number of basic principles and essential safeguards must be ensured in the process of adapting education to technological progress.

Humanity became dependent on the Internet with the increasing technological developments and especially the emergence of the pandemic. Everything from socializing to bank transactions, education, digital games, grocery shopping, and governmental processes are now actualized on digital platforms. The impact of new media on daily life and the ways of use have caused the concept of citizenship to change in a world that has become more global with the effect of the pandemic. Borders began to become blurry and concepts to become global. Subscribers spending a lot of time on digital platforms began to feel that they now belong to those platforms. Thus, digital citizenship has become an important subject. The first thing that comes to mind considering digital citizenship is the Model of Citizenship Model by Ribble and Bailey. This model of digital citizenship has a framework consisting of nine elements associated with each other. In this study, the digital citizenship elements starting with the digital access of digital technology users as digital trade, digital communication, digital literacy, digital ethics, digital law, digital rights and responsibilities, digital health, and digital security based on this model will be examined. Mastery of each element brings Internet subscribers one step closer to be named as digital citizens. These elements also serve as guidance for all subjects transferred to the digital medium such as education, economy, health, and law after the pandemic. The relationship between digital citizenship and the rapidly developing digital world during the Covid-19 pandemic will be revealed in this study. The researchers intend to examine the way digital citizenship is perceived in Turkey with semi- structured interviews.\",\"published_in\":\"The Turkish Online Journal of Design, Art and Communication, Vol 11, Iss 3, Pp 1019-1035 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital citizenship; digital communication; digital socializing; digital ethics; digital privacy; digital (online) education; Fine Arts; N; Arts in general; NX1-820; Communication.

Individuals who are digitally illiterate or who lack digital literacy face the situation of exclusion from the digital world. Therefore, in today&#039;s technology age, being digital literate is an important skill needed in people&#039;s workplace and social lives beyond educational institutions. The increased focus on the development of digital literacy should be a policy priority, especially for educational institutions. Because education, which includes the learning and teaching process, is an area where digital media are used.

In the future, several clusters of digital technology in the higher education will be deployed on the basis of data analytics, digital models, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and the blockchain. The study addresses the following objectives: 1) development of a structured \\u201cmap\\u201d of digital technology for higher education; 2) assessment of the extent of development and use of digital technologies in the higher education sphere at present (in developed countries and in a separate region of the Russian Federation \\u2013 Krasnoyarsk Krai); 3) assessment of the prospects for the development and adoption of digital technologies by 2035 (in developed countries and in Krasnoyarsk Krai). The following research methods were used: 1) a conceptual analysis of scientific publications, forecasts, foresight-studies and analytical reports; 2) expert interviews, 3) a questionnaire based survey (32 experts \\u2013 researchers, professors, representatives of government and consulting companies). The following core groups of digital technologies are designated: 1) digital solutions for defining the personal goals of education, educational navigation, building a project for an individual educational trajectory; 2) adaptive educational environment for the implementation of an individual educational trajectory; 3) digital solutions for learning activities support; monitoring the results of education; solutions for educational logistics; 4) digital solutions for assessment and certification (personal identification and competency assessment); 5) digital solutions for career support and lifelong education; 6) digital solutions for building and supporting university communities (including teachers, students, graduates, university partners); 7) digital solutions for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of competences at the population level. Each group includes 3\\u201312 technologies, so it is possible to build a detailed \\u201cmap\\u201d of digital technologies for higher education sphere. According to the experts, most of the major groups of digital technologies for education are currently (2018) in the stage of \\u201cworking prototypes and pilot products\\u201d and \\u201clocally used products\\u201d (in the developed countries of the world). The exceptions are \\u201cdigital solutions for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of competencies at the population level,\\u201d which are still at the \\u201cresearch and development\\u201d stage. By 2030, all technologies of major groups will reach the stage of \\u201cmass market products\\u201d and \\u201clocal market products\\u201d. The structure of assessments of the digital technology application in the present and prospects for adoption by 2030 for Krasnoyarsk Krai is generally similar to the structure of assessments for developed countries of the world, but the magnitudes of the estimates are much smaller. The result reflects the \\u201ccatching up\\u201d nature of the development of digital technology in the education sphere in the region.

The article is devoted to the development of digital education. The gap between generations and social groups exacerbates the contradictions between the education system and the demands of the information society, and the increase in the volume, accessibility, speed of acquisition and exchange of knowledge has changed the style of knowledge of modern man. The key competence was the ability to distinguish important from unimportant, reliable from unreliable. Students need to purposefully develop digital identity. All this gives rise to a set of problems facing the modern school. The purpose of the study described in the article is to identify promising ways to digitalize the school, build a model of digital school and identify a set of factors that are important for the transformation of the school for all in the school for everyone. Methodology. In the course of the study, based on the analysis of existing approaches to the development of digital technologies and digitalization of education, the ways of formation and development of a digital school are revealed. The structure of the core of digital education providing comparability of the knowledge, values, skills and competences mastered and shown in various types of activity of the person is defined. This is the value, activity and content basis for the formation of digital socio-cultural educational environment. This core is proposed to be considered as a basis for the development of concepts of subject areas, GEF and educational programs at all levels of education. Results. The interpretation of the term \\u00abdigital education\\u00bb is given, which is understood as educational activity, the key factors of which are digital data, processing, exchange and analysis of which allow the individual to achieve new results of education in a specific sociocultural situation. According to the model, the digital school provides not only training and education, but also effective integration of the individual into a high-tech rapidly changing complex environment. The educational ecosystem is an integrative socio-cultural environment, in the center of which is not a teacher of a traditional school, but a student, surrounded by peers and adults who help him realize his personal educational trajectory. Conclusion. The article outlines the prerequisites for a new era-the era of digital education, formulated the definition of the term \\u00abdigital education\\u00bb, justified the relevance of the development and the structure of the core of digital education, describes the model of digital school, presents the structure of the educational ecosystem and the effects of its implementation for different stakeholders.\",\"published_in\":\"RUDN Journal of Informatization in Education, Vol 16, Iss 4, Pp 295-307 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital education; the core of digital education; digital school; educational ecosystem; Information technology; T58.5-58.64\",\"subject\":\"digital education; the core of digital education; digital school; educational ecosystem; Information technology;; 5-\",\"authors\":\"Alexander M.

In contrast to traditional approaches to student agency in digital contexts that subsume technologies to educational intentions, media research has illustrated a more complex interplay between humans and technology. Drawing on this insight, the paper argues for a more critical disposition to digital student agency, wherein relational, cultural, and technological dynamics are central to agency. Specifically, the article proposes a framework for digital student agency that distinguishes five critical domains to student agency in digital contexts: (1) agentic possibility, (2) digital self-representation, (3) data uses, (4) digital sociality, and (5) digital temporality. The article concludes by outlining the implications of the framework for educational practice and academic research around student agency and student learning. Specifically, adopting the framework implies changes in how we investigate student agency in digital contexts and enables critical investigations of student-centred teaching practices.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontline Learning Research, Vol 9, Iss 3, Pp 52-68 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"student agency; networked publics; learning; educational technologies; digital education; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"student agency; networked publics; learning; educational technologies; digital education; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"Maria Hvid Stenalt\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14786\\/flr.v9i3.697\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"d6dec303926e3567b87c11b828a24e1646f47f2cf4df7303a2678b046764ae7d\",\"relevance\":347,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14786\\/flr.v9i3.697\"},{\"id\":\"f014453f8fdf7f9463758d7e3c7bcc7fe069adc14a51abd503be9e73e956e987\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.lib.uoguelph.ca\\/index.php\\/ajote\\/article\\/view\\/1936; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1916-7822; 1916-7822; doi:10.21083\\/ajote.v2i1.1936; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/54118e2ceefc4f0d901fade6bb868674\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21083\\/ajote.v2i1.1936; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/54118e2ceefc4f0d901fade6bb868674\",\"title\":\"TOWARDS UTILIZING NEW DIGITAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF PEACE EDUCATION IN NIGERIA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Recent events in Nigeria have shown that the country cannot move forward without considering peace education in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions.

The focus is then narrowed down to highlight creative machines and digital artmaking. By exploring the statements and artworks from computer scientists and digital artists, correlations to art education pedagogical approaches are then constructed. This will then lead into a recognition for a need to challenge and examine the ontological and epistemological assumptions present in art education.

In addition, the take up of social networking technologies and innovative methods of digital publishing have encouraged educators to produce, distribute and share content and commentary. Grey literature may make a substantial contribution to education even though issues such as credibility, access and a lack of standards can pose problems for producers and users. This paper begins by providing a context for the discussion of grey literature within the broader policy and education environment in Australia. An overview of grey literature as it appears in education in Australia introducing evidence of its usage, dissemination and application in Australian education then follows. Evidence about the access, dissemination and use of grey literature is drawn from an examination of the characteristics of a leading social networking and digital publishing service that was used by educators in schools, training institutes and teacher education faculties. This evidence is discussed in the context of influential national, state and institutional policies that address the use of digital technologies in education. As the take up of digital technologies in education increases, there is an expectation that the access to, dissemination of and use of digital publishing by and for educators will increase and have an impact on online professional learning and awareness of education research and practices.

Apps, games, computer programs, and social media, etc. can support and improve learning processes. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions of social life accelerated a shift towards the application of digital media in education as well as in distance learning. This paper answers questions about the current usage of digital media in non-formal education in Germany, especially in the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The results of a 2020 survey in Germany with 111 participants show that digital media are an integral part of non-formal education; in particular, audio and video recording and filesharing are used often. Notably, the usage of web calls and webinars has increased since the pandemic. Regarding the disadvantages of digitals formats, participants note the investment in time and effort as well as the expensive equipment needed for development. Despite being dissatisfied with existing offers, a lot of institutions have not developed their own digital education formats (yet). This indicates a possible need for further training and education of educators in non-formal ESD, enabling them to independently create digital formats. This would also contribute to the quality of digital formats, of which many were possibly developed without proper expertise.\",\"published_in\":\"Sustainability, Vol 14, Iss 2114, p 2114 (2022)\",\"year\":\"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital education; environmental education; global education; #ESDfor2030; Digital Sustainability Education (DSE); pandemic; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350\",\"subject\":\"digital education; environmental education; global education; #ESDfor Digital Sustainability Education (DSE); pandemic; Environmental effects of industries and plants; Renewable energy sources; Environmental sciences; \",\"authors\":\"Florian Kohler; Alina Kuthe; Fiona Rochholz; Alexander Siegmund\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su14042114\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"c7e2ac3729c9f80418531bc08ffb11316c1748d43ee8773f83fb8e2e191856a9\",\"relevance\":328,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su14042114\"},{\"id\":\"dd2be7c991f0ac2f5dd657f0170318ad490d0f6e7668290160339a920101c543\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/revistes.ub.edu\\/index.php\\/der\\/article\\/view\\/19052\\/pdf; Giles, J.

Tertiary students, internationally face both opportunities and challenges in learning and adapting to this paradigm shift in the delivery of education. It remains unclear how students in international contexts are responding to these changes in digital learning during and post-COVID-19. This paper aims to compare student perceptions of digital competence, confidence, and resilience in present times using data from surveys of tertiary students from Australia, Cambodia, China, India, and Malaysia. There are disparities not only in the teaching and learning pedagogies amongst these countries but also in the levels of technological advancement, infrastructure support, and pace of digital innovation in the delivery of courses. These differences have put in focus students both digital competencies and resilience as they pursue higher education on various digital learning platforms. Resilience includes the ability to bounce back or adapt from stress (Smith et al., 2008) Digital resilience is students tech-savviness and preparedness to adapt to different digital environments as they pursue higher education.

In youth leisure, computers are more than information devices: they convey stories, images, identities, and fantasies through providing imaginative opportunities for play, and as cultural and ideological forms. In this paper, I report on a project conducted with teacher education students at a university in Johannesburg, South Africa. The focus of the project is to examine how students construct their identities digitally through the multimodal narratives they create in the English classroom. To do this I report on two narratives, as well as a recurring theme, decolonisation. The latter theme is significant because it was during the time of this project that South African universities found themselves in the grip of decolonisation and free education protests. I use New Literacy Studies as a framework to theorise literacy practices, and the work of Hall and others to theorise identity. The paper presents further possible implications of digital identity construction for teaching and learning.Keywords: decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"published_in\":\"South African Journal of Education; Vol 38, No 2 (2018); 1-9 ; 2076-3433 ; 0256-0100\",\"year\":\"2018-06-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"subject\":\"decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"authors\":\"Kajee, Leila\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ajol.info\\/index.php\\/saje\\/article\\/view\\/173120\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"23f1739d2f39a41b3aebb4e7d3dbf751ba9741d5c2957bf88dd59684c8236bb4\",\"relevance\":323,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"3e4dcc501acfd56dc4f23fcd0ff664b484603f4d25fbadea9c8123cc18e6480b\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/oapub.org\\/edu\\/index.php\\/ejoe\\/article\\/view\\/2358\\/4996; http:\\/\\/oapub.org\\/edu\\/index.php\\/ejoe\\/article\\/view\\/2358; doi:10.46827\\/ejoe.v0i0.2358\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/oapub.org\\/edu\\/index.php\\/ejoe\\/article\\/view\\/2358; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.46827\\/ejoe.v0i0.2358\",\"title\":\"UNIVERSITY STUDENTS\\u2019 SKILLS IN USING THE INTERNET FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article focuses on digital skills competence of students in higher education.

The findings show that the students\\u2019 socioeconomic status influences the level of skills development. The relationship between SES and students\\u2019 skills shows the presence of the digital divide in higher education that increases learning inequalities.

In the context of the pandemic, the remote, distance, digital format of work has become top requested. Those events coincided with the general trend towards total digitalization of all spheres of life, including education. New concepts have emerged and taken hold - digital education and digital university. However, a mechanism for the development of a digital university has not yet been proposed. In the present study, an institutional approach was used to analyze the problems of the development of a digital university. The research scheme was used: institutions - motivation - control. The results of the empirical study (questionnaire and survey of university entries and its partners) made it possible to identify the existing contradictions between the participants in university activities and the external environment in terms of assessing aspects of the digital development of the university, to highlight the most effective institutions, conditions of positive motivation and control mechanisms for successful digital transformation of a university. The authors propose their own version of the concept for the development of a digital university, introducing as the core of it a new scientific concept - infrastructure logic. They lay a foundation for the principles of infrastructure logic, formation mechanisms and approaches to the use of indicators of digital development based on infrastructure logic, directions for improving the strategy of digital development of the university 4.0.

According to the pre-service teachers, in this study, digital storytelling project should be integrated in teacher education curriculum to equip new teachers with the skills they need to face the digital native and multicultural classrooms. The project helped the pre-service teachers to understand other peoples? culture and also enhanced their digital technology skills.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014\",\"subject_orig\":\"Classrooms; Multicultural education\",\"subject\":\"Classrooms; Multicultural education\",\"authors\":\"Chigona, Agnes\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11189\\/3465\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"1bc3a3358f7da6edb767ad1c91ac28f38573160ffca7c66594a7234db03258a9\",\"relevance\":308,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"7bfc7096443611ba6098c9924e3fc578d188dc9e763f34ed513bc76cd325cb48\",\"relation\":\"Early Childhood Education Journal\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10072\\/123797; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s10643-016-0792-z\",\"title\":\"A Conceptual Framework for Emergent Digital Literacy\",\"paper_abstract\":\"As we progress in the 21st century, children learn to become proficient readers and writers of both digital and non-digital texts. Knowledge, skills, and understandings of literacy emerge through sociocultural interactions with non-digital tools (e.g., paper-printed books) and digital tools (e.g., touch screen tablets). However, debate is ongoing over the role that digital experiences play in emergent literacy development. Researchers have voiced the need to conceptualise a common framework for literacy development that considers the emergence of digital literacy skills alongside conventional literacy skills and how these skills might interact during development. This is particularly important in light of the increasing use of digital texts used by young children, such as E-books and digital games. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that might guide research and practice by examining the relationships between emergent literacy skills, emergent digital literacy skills, and proficiency in reading and writing. ; Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Education and Professional Studies ; No Full Text\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education Systems not elsewhere classified\",\"subject\":\"Education Systems not elsewhere classified\",\"authors\":\"Neumann, Michelle; Finger, Glenn; Neumann, David\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10072\\/123797\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"7bfc7096443611ba6098c9924e3fc578d188dc9e763f34ed513bc76cd325cb48\",\"relevance\":306,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"57fd5eeacc1e0303c99ea1e38268568a79ac6c9dbfc8983de0e69b5310080564\",\"relation\":\"1436-4522; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11536\\/144777; EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY; WOS:000428889400014\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11536\\/144777\",\"title\":\"Guest Editorial: Digital Citizenship: Innovations in Education, Practice, and Pedagogy\",\"paper_abstract\":\"There are still disparities in technology-access despite economic pressures and widespread promises to overcome them.

Examples are given as an active position in the direction of ensuring digital transformations of educational and managerial processes in a particular educational institution; it contributes to the implementation of national tasks in the direction of ensuring the digital development of society. Emphasis is placed on how the role of methodological services is changing, on the need for systemic changes in the perception of the educational institution's perception of the process of ensuring the digital development of both teachers and students, and vocational education institutions in general. The study examines four vectors of digital development for vocational (technical) education institutions of Ukraine from the possible options, proposed by European colleagues who have already shown positive results at the level of the education system (vocational in particular) and a separate institution of vocational (technical) education. In particular, the possibility of measuring the level of digital development of the educational institution through the use of the SELFIE service, developed by the European Commission together with a group of educational experts and practitioners from European countries, was considered.

The study of the digital education role in the processes of transforming the country's economy and the formation of a single digital space, the goals and objectives of universities in the reform of higher education are determined, a model for assessing the digital competence of students is proposed. Research methods: analysis (separation of the general concept of \\u00abdigital competence\\u00bb into constituent elements), synthesis (merging of divided and investigated parts), induction (general review of digital technologies and digital competences), deduction (transition from the general perception of digital technologies and digital competences to the definition properties and characteristics of individual competencies and skills), abstraction (definition of peculiarities inherent in digital competencies), concretization (study of the features of individual digital computing ten this). Scientific novelty of the article is a model of digital literacy of students, developed on the basis of a pyramidal model taking into account the concept of digital competence. This model is based on a high level of understanding and generalization of digital student skills. The purpose of using the proposed model is to identify all spheres of knowledge, skills and abilities that should be considered for the formation and evaluation of digital competence. The proposed model is quite flexible and can be adapted to different target groups of students and digital users. The object of the research is the level of students' digital literacy, models, methods and techniques for measuring it. From the point of view of authors, special attention deserves a model, developed on the basis of a pyramidal model, taking into account the concept of digital competence. This model is based on a high level of understanding and generalization of students' digital skills. The purpose of using the proposed model is to identify all spheres of knowledge, skills and abilities that should be considered for the formation and evaluation of digital competence. The proposed model is flexible enough and can be adapted to different target groups of students and digital users. The main conclusions of the study can be considered: 1. Introduction of digital technologies in higher education to increase the level of digital literacy is an urgent requirement of time. 2. The purpose of introducing digital technologies into higher education is the training of highly skilled professionals for work in a post\\u2010industrial society. 3. Modern life requires the introduction of digital technologies in absolutely all spheres of human activity. 4.

Today, it has become the basis for the digital transformation of education, whose essence is transforming the methods of professional teaching by integrating digital technologies and moving to a data-based decision-making model. Among the participants of educational relations, there are diametrically opposite views on the possibility and feasibility of digitalization of education, especially at its initial stage. The purpose of this research is to present an authorial standpoint on the problem of digitalization of education with regard to both elementary general education in general, and digitalization of the Mathematics and Computer Science subject area, in particular, at the level of primary general education. The research methods include content analysis of scientific articles and methodological publications, the regulatory framework of school education, as well as generalization and systematization of international research in the field of the digital transformation of education. Authors considered external aspects of the digital transformation of primary education, determined by the general requirements for the information educational environment; highlighted activity areas related to the formation of students\\u2019 basic digital skills in the course of mastering all subject areas without exception; as well as revealed the problems of internal digitalization of the Mathematics and Computer Science subject area at the level of primary general education. The article substantiates the expediency of strengthening the logical and algorithmic components of the initial course of mathematics, the content line responsible for working with data, as well as several other issues related to theoretical computer science, and outlines prospects of the digital transformation of training of future primary school teachers to work in a modern digital educational environment.\",\"published_in\":\"SHS Web of Conferences, Vol 98, p 05023 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital transformation of education; primary education; mathematics and computer science subject area; elements of theoretical computer science; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"digital transformation of education; primary education; mathematics and computer science subject area; elements of theoretical computer science; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Bosova Lyudmila; Chekin Aleksandr; Borisova Yelena; Oleynikova Marina; Fedosov Aleksandr\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1051\\/shsconf\\/20219805023\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"b1a6e9824fbb3f4e10ee9ca31eab4e260d0deed791a301335538d7b1eda73f81\",\"relevance\":282,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1051\\/shsconf\\/20219805023\"},{\"id\":\"eb051623106762ce678ec1aef9415a375575f9bf526b1f6145e92f8555c4e3d5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.rta.lv\\/index.php\\/SIE\\/article\\/view\\/6277\\/5172; http:\\/\\/journals.rta.lv\\/index.php\\/SIE\\/article\\/view\\/6277; doi:10.17770\\/sie2021vol5.6277\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.rta.lv\\/index.php\\/SIE\\/article\\/view\\/6277; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17770\\/sie2021vol5.6277\",\"title\":\"COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF COVID-19 IMPACT ON STUDENTS\\u2019 VIEWS ON DIGITAL HIGHER EDUCATION\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Higher education sector has been significantly adapting to the new situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic.

With the digital transformation of education a significant change occurs not only in terms of what is considered to be a matter of education, but also in the very principles of interaction between the subjects of education. In order to do this, in the first section several examples of conceptual justifications of applying digital technologies in education are examined with the task of demonstrating how in such justifications the activity of education is reduced to the process of learning and what risks such instrumental interpretation engenders. Then, these issues are analyzed and contextualized utilizing the material of the philosophical discussion of the 20th century - the critique of the progressive education in the analytic philosophy of education. By outlining the relevance of the arguments of discussion on manner\\/matter to realities of digital education, the issue of the dominance of the logic of learning in current education is analyzed. In the last section several adjustments to the contemporary discourse on digitalization of education are proposed, aimed at finding a balance between individual and social dimensions of the problem of matter of education, given the current tendency of mass personalization in education. Particularly, the importance of the idea of education as a common good in the contemporary educational discourse is claimed.\",\"published_in\":\"RUDN Journal of Philosophy, Vol 25, Iss 4, Pp 626-639 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"philosophy; education; digital technologies; matter of education; formalization; mass personalization; adaptive learning; socialization; common good; subjects; Philosophy.

Nowadays, when a digital society is being built, digital transformation is becoming the basis for the world economic development. This leads to a rapid change in the professions being in demand in the employment market and, consequently, the professional requirements for the qualification framework, competences in particular. Thus, educational activities require updating the content and methods of teaching, finding innovative forms of learning, expanding the access to educational resources, implementing learning opportunities without restrictions on the bases of space and time, introducing new approaches to the organisation of educational services in general. The purpose of this study is to analyse and systematise the European experience in the field of the digital transformation of education, outlining some ways to use it for transforming the education in Ukraine. The main research methods used are as follows: a systematic analysis of regulatory, scientific, and methodological sources on the digital transformation of education in European countries, the study of the methodological tools to support teachers in the development of a digital society. For the digital transformation of education, it is necessary to take a number of important steps which include: the development of normative initiatives by the state to ensure the regulatory framework enabling the transformation of education; the modernisation of educational systems, the updating of the content of school and university education; training and retraining of teachers, taking into consideration the increasing proficiency level of their digital skills and competences. The paper presents in detail how these steps are implemented in the EU. Based on the analysed sources, we can come to these conclusions: in Europe, the conditions facilitating an increase in pedagogues\\u2019 proficiency in terms of digital competences have been created; the tools aimed at supporting their activities have been developed, which contributes to the digital transformation of education in general. Ukraine has also recognised the digital transformation as a priority policy for the development of the digital economy and the emergence of a digital society as a whole. To ensure a quality educational process, the modern education system of Ukraine needs changes. The digitalisation of all levels of education, and, in the future, their digital transformation appear to be important steps in this respect.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u041d\\u0430\\u0443\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0412\\u0456\\u0441\\u043d\\u0438\\u043a \\u041f\\u0456\\u0432\\u0434\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0443\\u043a\\u0440\\u0430\\u0457\\u043d\\u0441\\u044c\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u041d\\u0430\\u0446\\u0456\\u043e\\u043d\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u041f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0423\\u043d\\u0456\\u0432\\u0435\\u0440\\u0441\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u0442\\u0443 \\u0456\\u043c\\u0435\\u043d\\u0456 \\u041a. \\u0414. \\u0423\\u0448\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u044c\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e, Vol 132, Iss 3, Pp 71-78 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital transformation; digitalisation of education; digital transformation of education; digital society; Education (General); L7-991\",\"subject\":\"digital transformation; digitalisation of education; digital transformation of education; digital society; \",\"authors\":\"Strutynska Oksana\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24195\\/2617-6688-2020-3-9\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"69324f698af7c7e3b101b7e31873c10ab7b36204600731a5f930e9074d570c5e\",\"relevance\":265,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24195\\/2617-6688-2020-3-9\"},{\"id\":\"9ed55ddd23801ee6ab7b18ffaf55bf90bb8bcc2620a43a65b21603a1257d5c37\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.4901722; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/4901723; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.4901723; oai:zenodo.org:4901723\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/4901723; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.4901723\",\"title\":\"Shaping the Future of Education in the Fourth Industrial Digital Revolution\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The fourth industrial revolution is transforming our world at a staggering pace, with never-before dreamt of innovation accelerating the move away from mechanical and analog electronic technology towards STAARA technology.

The analysis of regulative and scientific sources allowed to single out a number of trends, in particular: there will be a transition to a digital university as a set of digital educational services and educational content soon; strengthening competition between universities, coming out the possibility of organizing remote interaction as a primary feature of digital technologies; universities\\u2019 reach of new target groups with limited access to higher education due to living conditions, geographical location, etc.; digital learning resources can promote international mobility of higher education student and staff; cooperation becomes an essential part of university education; digital technologies contribute to the search for new virtual locations and forms such as digital campuses, virtual exhibition hubs, coworking centres, etc.; digital innovations are not only technical but also structural changes which are equally important to ensure this process. The general trend of using adaptive educational systems and data-based systems, which will make the educational process in higher education institutions more transparent and measurable, is outlined. The author points out that digital technologies have limitations in scalability, and the development of such systems requires significant funding due to the high level of knowledge and the need for constant updating. It is revealed that the imperfection of the regulatory framework is becoming a deterrent to the introduction of digital innovations. For example, the outdated copyright does not allow to fully realize the potential of digital technologies in terms of ensuring open access to quality education or academic integrity.

Digital education is increasingly used for clinical practice guideline dissemination and adoption. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of digital education in improving the adoption of clinical practice guidelines. Methods We performed a systematic review and searched seven electronic databases from January 1990 to September 2018. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included studies in any language evaluating the effectiveness of digital education on clinical practice guidelines compared to other forms of education or no intervention in healthcare professionals. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of the body of evidence. Results Seventeen trials involving 2382 participants were included. The included studies were diverse with a largely unclear or high risk of bias. They mostly focused on physicians, evaluated computer-based interventions with limited interactivity and measured participants\\u2019 knowledge and behaviour. With regard to knowledge, studies comparing the effect of digital education with no intervention showed a moderate, statistically significant difference in favour of digital education intervention (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI 0.16, 1.54; I 2 = 83%, n = 3, moderate quality of evidence). Studies comparing the effect of digital education with traditional learning on knowledge showed a small, statistically non-significant difference in favour of digital education (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI \\u2212 0.12, 0.59; I 2 = 34%, n = 3, moderate quality of evidence). Three studies measured participants\\u2019 skills and reported mixed results. Of four studies measuring satisfaction, three studies favoured digital education over traditional learning. Of nine studies evaluating healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviour change, only one study comparing email-delivered, spaced education intervention to no intervention reported improvement in the intervention group. Of three studies reporting patient outcomes, only one study comparing email-delivered, spaced education games to non-interactive online resources reported modest improvement in the intervention group. The quality of evidence for outcomes other than knowledge was mostly judged as low due to risk of bias, imprecision and\\/or inconsistency. Conclusions Health professions digital education on clinical practice guidelines is at least as effective as traditional learning and more effective than no intervention in terms of knowledge. Most studies report little or no difference in healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviours and patient outcomes. The only intervention shown to improve healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviour and modestly patient outcomes was email-delivered, spaced education. Future research should evaluate interactive, simulation-based and spaced forms of digital education and report on outcomes such as skills, behaviour, patient outcomes and cost.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Medicine, Vol 17, Iss 1, Pp 1-16 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Clinical practice guidelines; Health professions education; Systematic review; Digital education; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"Clinical practice guidelines; Health professions education; Systematic review; Digital education; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Lorainne Tudor Car; Aijia Soong; Bhone Myint Kyaw; Kee Leng Chua; Naomi Low-Beer; Azeem Majeed\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12916-019-1370-1\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"78a502dba86c273a26dbdcffad138cd76409bb3d9eeb223409e1a6860b18e856\",\"relevance\":253,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12916-019-1370-1\"},{\"id\":\"263d5e12fc60adc08a9da87ffdd588f1f04cd5f17688cb3e1049e054b9a7d41d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.utas.edu.au\\/34123\\/2\\/138340%20-%20COVID-19.%2020%20countries%27%20higher%20education%20intra-period%20digital%20pedagogy%20responses.pdf; Crawford, J orcid:0000-0002-2191-6216 , Butler-Henderson, K orcid:0000-0002-6082-2108 , Rudolph, J, Malkawi, B, Glowatz, M, Burton, R, Magni, P and Lam, S 2020 , 'COVID-19: 20 countries' higher education intra-period digital pedagogy responses' , Journal of Applied Learning & Teaching, vol. 3, no. 1 , pp. 1-20 , doi:10.37074\\/jalt.2020.3.1.7 <http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.37074\\/jalt.2020.3.1.7>.\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.utas.edu.au\\/34123\\/; https:\\/\\/eprints.utas.edu.au\\/34123\\/2\\/138340%20-%20COVID-19.%2020%20countries%27%20higher%20education%20intra-period%20digital%20pedagogy%20responses.pdf\",\"title\":\"COVID-19: 20 countries' higher education intra-period digital pedagogy responses\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant challenges for the global higher education community.

We believe there are significant opportunities to learn from the pedagogical developments of other universities, in order to strengthen our collective response to COVID-19 now and into the future.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"higher education; COVID19; coronavirus; crisis management; digital education; online education; pandemic\",\"subject\":\"higher education; COVID coronavirus; crisis management; digital education; online education; pandemic\",\"authors\":\"Crawford, J; Butler-Henderson, K; Rudolph, J; Malkawi, B; Glowatz, M; Burton, R; Magni, P; Lam, S\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.utas.edu.au\\/34123\\/\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"263d5e12fc60adc08a9da87ffdd588f1f04cd5f17688cb3e1049e054b9a7d41d\",\"relevance\":252,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e18fa066e53da101d4f1de9d557bb0b325fd5c725275eee3c41402475a2acfad\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/sitito.cs.msu.ru\\/index.php\\/SITITO\\/article\\/view\\/722; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2411-1473; doi:10.25559\\/SITITO.17.202101.722; 2411-1473; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c2557f04a72d48d58065373ad1710da0\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25559\\/SITITO.17.202101.722; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c2557f04a72d48d58065373ad1710da0\",\"title\":\"From Digitalization to Digital Transformation of Military Vocational Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The digitalization of society is actively affecting digital transformations in the education system. Research is carried out mainly in the field of basic and secondary education, less often in the higher education system. The system of higher military vocational education is the most problematic area of research. The article discusses the trend of adaptation of methods and practices of informatization and digitalization of civilian universities in the activities of military educational institutions. The authors consider this approach to be erroneous. The paper presents the results of the analysis of existing solutions in the field of informatization of the education system of a military university. The boundaries of applicability of the main directions of digitalization of education in the conditions of a military university have been investigated. When writing this article, we applied the methods of bibliometric analysis, content analysis of publications and query statistics. As the initial steps in the field of digitalization of military vocational education, the development of an electronic learning environment system in the context of the formation of digital competencies is proposed.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0421\\u043e\\u0432\\u0440\\u0435\\u043c\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u044b\\u0435 \\u0438\\u043d\\u0444\\u043e\\u0440\\u043c\\u0430\\u0446\\u0438\\u043e\\u043d\\u043d\\u044b\\u0435 \\u0442\\u0435\\u0445\\u043d\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0433\\u0438\\u0438 \\u0438 IT-\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435, Vol 17, Iss 1 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"higher military vocational education; digitalization; digital transformation of higher education; digital literacy; information competence; electronic educational environment; Electronic computers.

This paper explores the role of design thinking and the promotion of abductive problem situations when developing digital literacies in construction education. The impacts of advanced digital modelling technologies on construction management practices and education are investigated before an examination of design thinking, the role of abductive reasoning and the rise of normative models of design thinking workflows. The paper then explores the role that design thinking can play in the development of new digital literacies in contemporary construction studies. A three-part framework for the implementation of a design thinking approach to construction is presented. The paper closes with a discussion of the importance of models of design thinking for learning and knowledge production, emphasising how construction management education can benefit from them.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"construction management education; design thinking; digital literacy; building information modelling\",\"subject\":\"construction management education; design thinking; digital literacy; building information modelling\",\"authors\":\"Jupp, Julie; Awad, Ramsey\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10547\\/335938\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"439d9626cb29ca537bb3d387a90ee68e9bcacba0b9b969ab2f29c242ab28eede\",\"relevance\":223,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"25e0086019368067b71e4acb0d98ea63ee72f2316a0764e5eb30c0f6e17d4e76\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.journals.iobmresearch.com\\/index.php\\/JoEED\\/article\\/view\\/711\\/158; 10.22555\\/joeed.v3i1.711.g158\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.journals.iobmresearch.com\\/index.php\\/JoEED\\/article\\/view\\/711; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22555\\/joeed.v3i1.711\",\"title\":\"Insights of School Head About Marketing Education Services Through Digital Media\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study mainly focuses on the insights of a private school\\u2019s head pertaining to the use of digital media in educational marketing.

This is especially crucial in the vocational education context, which is closer to the world of work and, therefore, more sensitive to the disruptive changes of digitalisation. This chapter addresses this issue by proposing the result of a project that aimed to identify a new professional profile in the context of dual vocational education in Switzerland. The Digital Facilitator is a new term that refers to a teacher with advanced digital competency who is an expert in facilitating digital innovation adoption within educational institutions. Thus, it constitutes a possible concrete way to address the issue of integrating the individual and the organisational perspectives related to digital transformation. The profile is discussed by presenting an analysis of acknowledged existing frameworks and by considering the specificities of the context in which it was developed. The opportunities and challenges associated with introducing the profile are also critically addressed.\",\"published_in\":\"Digital Transformation of Learning Organizations 2021 p. 169-187\",\"year\":\"2021-01-06\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital skills; Competence profile; Vocational education; Teacher education; School digital transformation\",\"subject\":\"Digital skills; Competence profile; Vocational education; Teacher education; School digital transformation\",\"authors\":\"Cattaneo, Alberto A.

Norway implemented in 2006 a new national curriculum which increased the status of digital competence to be the fifth basic skill in the Norwegian elementary school (stage 1-13). This was a historic event and never before has digital competence achieved such status in curricula, neither nationally nor internationally. The same has newly happened with the new General Plan for Teacher Education where digital competence has become the fifth basic skill in all subjects. However, both teacher educators and teachers lack sufficient digital competence to fulfil these ambiguous policy goals and therefore the article suggest how a model of digital competence can bridge some of the gap between the intentions in the policy documents and the teachers\\/teacher educators\\u2019 practise. At the same time the article attempts to elaborate our perception of the concept digital competence in an educational discourse and how one can define digital competence in light of a Scandinavian educational perspective.

Pre-service teachers' perceptions of digital citizenship and their patterns of knowledge of digital citizenship were explored. Background This study examines the concepts of digital citizenship, including digital communication, digital rights \\/ responsibilities, critical thinking, digital participation, digital security, digital skills, digital ethics, and digital commerce, of pre-service teachers and their interaction with instructional technology. This research study will inform policies and strategies to enhance teacher trainings and education in Turkey. Methodology A mixed methodology of data sources including a survey and open-ended questions were collected to explore pre-service teachers' perceptions of digital citizenship. The Digital Citizenship Scale was used as the quantitative data collection instrument. Various statistical techniques and tests such as ANOVA, t-Test, and Tukey HSD were used in the analysis of the data. Contribution This study contributes to existing literature knowledge by demonstrating the patterns of digital citizenship that influence Turkish pre-service teachers' professional development and deepening the discussion of change in policies and strategies in education programs in Turkey. Findings Results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference of digital citizenship scores of male and female pre-service teachers with male participants scoring higher than female participants. However, participants' mean scores did not significantly differentiate by their departments. Similarly, it was observed that participants' mean scores did not significantly differentiate by the high school types. As far as parent educational background was concerned, the mean scores of the participants did not indicate a significant difference by the education level of the mother, but the scores differed significantly by the father's education level. Similar responses emerged in the open-ended questions. Participants expressed that they felt competent in digital communication and digital participation and their parents are partly influential in the improvement of these skills. In addition, the majority of the participants stated that the major they enrolled did not have any contribution to their digital skills so far. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for practitioners to include in their teacher education programs training pre-service teachers to become digital citizens. Recommendations for Researchers Recommendations for researchers to include identifying practical activities that enhance pre-service teachers' digital citizenship skills. Impact on Society The findings and results of this study will help display a universal digital citizenship model for pre-service and veteran teachers in Turkey as well as to strengthen their interaction with instructional and information technologies through policy and strategy changes in educational settings. Future Research Further studies should be undertaken, especially in developing countries. Future research can further explore pre-service teachers' perceptions of digital citizenship such as digital rights, responsibilities, and ethics as well as evaluating the opinions of school administrators, students, and parents regarding their perceptions of digital citizenship in educational settings.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital Citizenship; Pre-Service Primary School Teachers; Digital Technologies; Internet\",\"subject\":\"Digital Citizenship; Pre-Service Primary School Teachers; Digital Technologies; Internet\",\"authors\":\"Ata, Ridvan; Yildirim, Kasim\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12809\\/1172\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"946d902bd29bffc6268ebcc633986bd2c80db1319b32307ac9ba6959ca002178\",\"relevance\":200,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"91c11d5d784b94ce95b33af160abf917163aa56264479cdf9d7610376d7ce7cd\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.oslomet.no\\/index.php\\/seminar\\/article\\/view\\/4254; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1504-4831; doi:10.7577\\/seminar.4254; 1504-4831; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9f781dd748184e65b9a6ae61abee3960\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7577\\/seminar.4254; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9f781dd748184e65b9a6ae61abee3960\",\"title\":\"Global Education Industry - Exploring the state of affairs in Austria\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Digitization initiatives in the field of education always correspond with developments in the education industry.

Adaptation of education processes both in kindergartens and universities is related with readiness of teachers for implementation of digital technologies into education process. The significance of their use in education is accompanied by numerous questions regarding elimination of negative influence of digital content on a forming developing person, on their rational and reasonable application at early stages of social and personal development of preschool children. The conceptual field of pedagogy is supplemented by new categories: digital education, digital education environment, digital competence. This article presents results of teachers\\u2019 surveying on the issue of readiness to designing information environment and attitude to the digital technologies implemented into education. On the one hand, the teachers highlighted advantages of the applied information technologies: individual education, possibility to master the program by preschool children and to consolidate knowledge and skills in the case of prolonged absence from studies, time saving, mobility and flexibility of education. On the other hand, the teachers mentioned the main drawbacks of the use of digital technologies: possible harm for health of children, inability of full development of speech, communication skills, development of gaming activity. The main problems preventing active use of modern technologies are comprised of low digital competence of university graduates and working teachers; age features of preschool children, which do not allow to study material without assistance by adults; the lack of opportunities of pupil\\u2019s parents to actively participate in educational activity of preschool entity.\",\"published_in\":\"SHS Web of Conferences, Vol 98, p 05028 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digitalization of education; tutors; preschool education; education environment; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"digitalization of education; tutors; preschool education; education environment; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Zakharova Larisa; Andrianova Yelena; Silakova Marina; Subbotina Yekaterina\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1051\\/shsconf\\/20219805028\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"247dd21c7eba6c2d78026ead70c41cf1d304d30afb8f10c2b2af653ac1b164f2\",\"relevance\":198,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1051\\/shsconf\\/20219805028\"},{\"id\":\"eb6fefb5e57764cffd8504a5424e49695f5bbaebbb4aa5cc3be4b99ec877d1e4\",\"relation\":\"Frontiers in Education;January 2022 %7C Volume 6 %7C Article 784701; https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/articles\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2021.784701\\/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Fronti; urn:issn:2504-284X; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2980954; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2021.784701; cristin:1980881\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2980954; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2021.784701\",\"title\":\"The Digital Transformation of Higher Education Teaching: Four Pedagogical Prescriptions to Move Active Learning Pedagogy Forward\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Digital learning technologies are expected to reform higher education: The recent Digital Education Action Plan (2021\\u20132027) of the European Commission (EC) states that digital education should facilitate more personalised, flexible, and student-centred teaching (European Commission, 2021). This places great demands on university teachers, whose technological skills have long been considered the most formidable barrier to the digital transformation of higher education (B\\u00f8rte et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a steep technological learning curve among higher education teachers. Overnight, university teachers were forced to adapt their teaching to a digital, online format to meet the needs of more than 1.5 billion students across the globe who have been affected by COVID-19 restrictions (UNESCO, 2021). Despite a great willingness to change, over a year into the pandemic, the frustration among (university) teachers has become apparent. A United Kingdom survey found that higher education teachers thought that their pedagogical practis had been \\u201creduced to the fulfilment of rudimentary technical functions\\u201d and that they played more of a transmissionist pedagogical role (Watermeyer et al., 2020). Taking the perspective of the students, recent survey data from Norwegian higher education shows that, during the pandemic, lack of motivation and sense of loneliness have been an increasing problem among students (NOKUT the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education, 2020). From this we learn that a fully digital approach in higher education has limitations both when it comes to pedagogical practices and students\\u2019 well-being. ; publishedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"784701 ; Frontiers in Education ; 6 ; 1-6\",\"year\":\"2022-01-14T08:16:16Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital education; Educational technology; Pedagogy; Blended learning; Active learning pedagogy\",\"subject\":\"Digital education; Educational technology; Pedagogy; Blended learning; Active learning pedagogy\",\"authors\":\"R\\u00f8e, Yngve; Wojniusz, Slawomir; Bjerke, Annette Hessen\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2980954\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"eb6fefb5e57764cffd8504a5424e49695f5bbaebbb4aa5cc3be4b99ec877d1e4\",\"relevance\":197,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"863206dcdbafef366a47987db957b723bf4c8652d9deab5249d41d2ca853bbe4\",\"relation\":\"International Journal of Inclusive Education;; https:\\/\\/www.tandfonline.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1080\\/13603116.2021.1937344; International Journal of Inclusive Education. 2021, .; urn:issn:1360-3116; urn:issn:1464-5173; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2834337; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/13603116.2021.1937344; cristin:1916314\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2834337; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/13603116.2021.1937344\",\"title\":\"Increasing faculty\\u2019s competence in digital accessibility for inclusive education: a systematic literature review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The use of information and communications technology (ICT) in higher education institutions has increased in the past 20 years. While ICT has brought many benefits to students and faculty, research shows that it also creates barriers and challenges for students with disabilities due to the inaccessibility of digital tools and learning materials.

This systematic literature review aims to study existing work on increasing the faculty members\\u2019 competence in providing accessible and inclusive digital learning materials and environments to students in higher education. Sixteen peer-reviewed papers were included and analysed. Most trainings included topics on disability and awareness, legislation, and methods of producing accessible digital materials and providing inclusive digital learning environments. While surveys and interviews were mostly used to evaluate training outcomes, there was a lack of objective data and commonly accepted instrument for evaluation. Good practices and further research opportunities are identified.

The modern education is viewed as \\\"soft power\\\" from the actor-network and connectivism approaches; position in the modern society integration processes; as a way to achieve the goals of the national youth development in the global space of cooperation; as a functional mechanism that develops a digital society and overcomes the digital inequality; as a new type of the subject-subject interaction, provided by the subject continuous education in the field of telecommunication technologies, as well as the communication between subjects and social institutions; as the teaching staff training for the scientific and technological development of the society, which became digital in the 21st century.The leading method in the problem study was the educational practice reflection, which allows identifying the mechanisms of the digital education diversification and upgrading; to determine the degree of the digital product influence on the educational strategy realization; to evaluate the educational organizations; responsibility for the results, the quality of the subject education.As a result of the study, the authors will determine the cognitive barriers existing in the education practice which actualize the situation \\\"here and now\\\", which contribute to the appeal to the digitalization phenomenon as a change in the thinking paradigm; to the study of the new technologies, the living projection of the virtual world with its inherent mutations and contradictions by the human subject; to creation the practice-oriented educational environment that can form competencies among students which allow the educational subject to be competitive in the labor market and in-demand in the global digital world.\",\"published_in\":\"ARPHA Proceedings 3 355-368\",\"year\":\"2020-11-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital education; scientific youth; network; actor; national identity; educational resources\",\"subject\":\"digital education; scientific youth; network; actor; national identity; educational resources\",\"authors\":\"Bykasova, Larisa V.; Belyak, Ekaterina A.; Krevsoun, Margarita V.; Podbereznyj, Vladimir V.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/4303197\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"46a4f0ba030a2617e68d74512572c754dad0aa38203ba85430806aa1625564d7\",\"relevance\":190,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"6c6b458d21d4d2044ea1f55f07c769b4529aa52b4862705ea61a7da1345e428d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/online-journals.org\\/index.php\\/i-jep\\/article\\/view\\/17515; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2192-4880; 2192-4880; doi:10.3991\\/ijep.v11i2.17515; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2d8545602c3b4659a8d86c15db79cfc9\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3991\\/ijep.v11i2.17515; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2d8545602c3b4659a8d86c15db79cfc9\",\"title\":\"Exploring the Readiness for Digital Transformation in a Higher Education Institution towards Industrial Revolution 4.0\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Assessing the impact of digital transformation in the fundamental areas of higher education at a specific university, i.e., Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) will show us the readiness for the digital university.

The analysis of survey results, thereby, discloses the effects achieved by practical implementation of digital transformation solutions at HUST. The results of this study allow us to introduce a readiness framework for digital transformation as a reference for the other higher education institutions.

While some literature indicates certain challenges in this regard, in general, the emphasis is on an encouragement and promotion of digital technology in higher education. While we recognised the positive potential of the use of digital technology in higher education, we were cautious of an instrumentalist and disembodied understanding of (digital) technology and its potential impact on higher education \\u2013 as a sector of education and as a body of students. Aim: To re-conceptualise the way in which technology is understood for its use in the higher education sector, as is argued, would be of benefit for transformation in higher education. Setting: South African Higher Education sector. Methods: Phenomenology of embodiment. Results: An embodied understanding of technology through the embodied phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty and an explication of its potential for transformation in higher education via the working concept of the Embodied Screen leads to a full understanding of the student as embodied and socially-embedded individual. Conclusion: A more holistic and embodied understanding of digital technology serves to supplement transformation in higher education, especially if transformation is itself understood in concrete social and bodily terms as is the case in the South African context.\",\"published_in\":\"Transformation in Higher Education, Vol 3, Iss 0, Pp e1-e8 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital technology; technology; embodiment; higher education; transformation; merleau-Ponty; phenomenology; Theory and practice of education; LB5-3640\",\"subject\":\"digital technology; technology; embodiment; higher education; transformation; merleau-Ponty; phenomenology; Theory and practice of education; \",\"authors\":\"Jean du Toit; Ann\\u00e9 H.

It was done with the aim to show the heuristic potential of the conceptualizations of the digital culture in philosophical anthropology and philosophy of education. The orientation function of the concept \\u201chomo digitalis\\u201d is unveiled, which is wide-spread using in the West-European, especially in Germany, and in the provocative philosophy of education. The ideal-typically construct of the human as the creation and the creator of the digital culture explains the distinctiveness of the communications in the space of this culture which is represented generally as a visual culture making provocation on purpose making close of the traditional writing culture. There is settling a comparative analyze of human figures created of the different generations of the German philosophical anthropology with accentuating on the semantics of homo digitalis, homo faber and homo creator which are partly complementary. The spatially and temporally characteristics of the digital culture are described, its forms of the communication are explicating in their singularity where the phatic communication predominates and risks of the digital alienation exists. The digital culture changes the self-recognition of the post-industrial societies which need world-view and moral orientation including expertly moral evaluation that is necessary for the prevention of the modernization risks. The pathologies of the digital culture, especially the digital dementia can be observed in the practices of the digital education else, but the blended Learning, if it is rationally organized and adequately administrated available resources, can minimizes those pathologies.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0424\\u0456\\u043b\\u043e\\u0441\\u043e\\u0444\\u0456\\u044f \\u043e\\u0441\\u0432\\u0456\\u0442\\u0438, Vol 26, Iss 1, Pp 8-36 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"homo digitalis; ontology of the digitally; digital culture; education; blended learning; pathology; alienation; communication; internet; ethics; Education (General); L7-991; Philosophy (General); B1-5802\",\"subject\":\"homo digitalis; ontology of the digitally; digital culture; education; blended learning; pathology; alienation; communication; internet; ethics; \",\"authors\":\"Maria Kultaieva\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.31874\\/2309-1606-2020-26-1-1\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"20f59ea4469528609a7a0f8557502b8b286e7d0a4758f5575a8847b1723d5554\",\"relevance\":173,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.31874\\/2309-1606-2020-26-1-1\"},{\"id\":\"6c1682435a02ef88408f721589c706b078b4f72fcf4a6c1c97df3f8dfefc0f9d\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/14782103211049914; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/14782103211049914; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/14782103211049914\",\"title\":\"Educating for the future? Mapping the emerging lines of precision education governance\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Managing the future has become one of the major focuses of global governance in education. In its current mode, education seems unable to answer the needs and interests of the market and future megatrends, such as globalisation and digitalisation. Calls for precision education to introduce the usage of digital platforms, artificial intelligence in education, and knowledge from the behavioural and life sciences are getting a foothold in widening powerful networks of strengthening global governance and EdTech business. By bringing together some of the emerging changes in education governance, in this article we argue for a new constitution of governance, precision education governance. Precision education governance combines three overlapping and strengthening lines of governance: (i) global governance of education, (ii) marketisation, privatisation and digitalisation, and (iii) behavioural and life sciences as the basis for managing the future education. In the article, we highlight the importance in bringing these so far separately studied lines together to understand how they shape the aims and outcomes of education, knowledge and understanding of human subjectivity more thoroughly than before.\",\"published_in\":\"Policy Futures in Education ; page 147821032110499 ; ISSN 1478-2103 1478-2103\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education\",\"subject\":\"Education\",\"authors\":\"Mertanen, Katariina; Vainio, Saara; Brunila, Kristiina\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/14782103211049914\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"6c1682435a02ef88408f721589c706b078b4f72fcf4a6c1c97df3f8dfefc0f9d\",\"relevance\":169,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/14782103211049914\"},{\"id\":\"284d404560a8e8b7129065a091c61b9a178824a2994fc833056a78183c208e16\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ir-library.ku.ac.ke\\/handle\\/123456789\\/12793\",\"title\":\"Effective Utilization of Computers and other ICTs in the Management and Delivery of Education in Kenya: Status and Unexploited Opportunities\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper was presented at the International Conference on \\u2018Re-Engineering Education for Sustainable Development\\u2019 held on 18th \\u2013 20th May 2015 at Kenyatta University Conference Centre (KUCC) Nairobi, Kenya ; Research has shown that use of information, communication technologies (ICTs) in education improves education standards in a country.

Digital curation is gradually finding its way into higher education curricula aimed at fostering social media literacies. Teachers are urged to blend informal and formal learning and since most people informally use curation in their daily lives for compiling relevant information, it may be fairly easy to adopt digital curation in teaching and learning. Teachers, however, require considerable insight in incorporating various informal digital curation tools in educational practices. The SECTIONS model may assist in guiding decisions around the suitability of digital curation tools for a higher education environment. Including digital literacy training in the professional development of academic staff members may sensitize them to the possibilities that incorporating digital approaches in curricula offer. The Five Cs of Digital Curation framework may guide academic staff members in compiling suitable digital material. There as yet appears not to be a pedagogy that fully acknowledges the various digital curation processes. A pedagogy of abundance, acknowledging that content often is freely available and abundant, may eventually prove relevant in this regard.&lt;\\/p&gt;\",\"published_in\":\"The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning ; volume 17, issue 5 ; ISSN 1492-3831\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education\",\"subject\":\"Education\",\"authors\":\"Ungerer, Leona M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.19173\\/irrodl.v17i5.2566\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"6efefb972f3e7f3a6deee87d4a3f1f4ec59348ab4ecd51b88d4c54bb8cae4ed3\",\"relevance\":139,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.19173\\/irrodl.v17i5.2566\"},{\"id\":\"94772f6b0f7a3518c0d7f18c520c786dc924e49023eb585900585df2f39af0fe\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ijem.com\\/\\/IJEM_5_3_465.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2469-9632; 2469-9632; doi:10.12973\\/ijem.5.3.465; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7217663407b145ef8a4684cefedf1726\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.12973\\/ijem.5.3.465; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7217663407b145ef8a4684cefedf1726\",\"title\":\"Social Studies Teacher Candidates\\u2019 Perception of Digital Citizenship\",\"paper_abstract\":\"With the rapid pace of technological and digital change, the use of mass communication and digital communication tools, and internet usage have become very prevalent and thus digital citizenship education has become a necessity for individuals so that they can effectively use these technologies.

As the use of digital resources continue to rise within higher institutions of learning, students are expected to develop the required digital literacy skills. Digital literacy skill is a basic requirement for students to function effectively in the information society, which is experiencing a paradigm shift from print resources to digital resources. Hence, digital literacy skill becomes very important since the use of digital resources depend on the competences in using digital resources. In the fast-growing knowledge society, information literacy has become one of the most important skills. This is because students with research information needs will most likely use digital resources if they have the skills required for their effective usage. Whilst information literacy seems to be a term that is mostly associated with higher education, its application to digital resources is yet to be widely exploited. In order to foster the development of digital literacy skills through institutional curriculum, this study explores the dimensional constructs of digital literacy with the aim of having students who can use digital tools to advance learning and keeping up with changing technologies as well as become global digital citizens. The dimensional constructs of digital literacy as outlined in this study are important in the use of digital resources because of the proliferation of digital information presently experienced due to a series of developmental digital activities in our world.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"Dimensional constructs -- higher education; Digital literacy; skills-- higher education\",\"subject\":\"Dimensional constructs; higher education; Digital literacy; skills-- higher education\",\"authors\":\"Odede, Israel R.; Jiyane, Glenrose V.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10530\\/1860\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"b0d071e1cb96125c75d45ea57fca59eda4c7ea9d6a3883084b58bfe4dfbe2e82\",\"relevance\":134,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"0d7dd898035c314e4064d15d91ae14132654bb493bb4d79b4dae214d45af9d56\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/ijilt-03-2020-0023; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/IJILT-03-2020-0023\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/IJILT-03-2020-0023\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"Empowering children to make and shape our digital futures \\u2013 from adults creating technologies to children transforming cultures\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose Digital technology education of children needs to be reconsidered. The purpose of this paper is to focus on empowering the young generation as regards digital technology. Digital technology education should reap the benefits of recent developments brought in by extensive, ongoing digitalization and prepare the young generation to manage and master in their technology rich future. The recent COVID 19 pandemic has made this particularly relevant and visible in the society. The young generation should adopt a proactive and critical stance toward digital technology and consider how design and technology can be used for making the world a better place. Design\\/methodology\\/approach This commentary reviews literature on the complex concept of empowerment and suggests a model on the aspects to be considered when aiming at empowering the young generation as regards digital technology in the context of digital technology education. Findings A model is proposed that comprehensively addresses empowerment of children as regards digital technology both at individual and collective levels and in mainstream sense as a relational and motivational construct as well as in critical sense in terms of collective empowerment, social responsibility and liberation of the oppressed. Research limitations\\/implications Radical renewal in the children's education is needed in the digital age. This model outlines aspects to be considered in such a transformation. The insights should be valuable for research communities addressing the topic of children's education in the digital age in general or the topic of children's digital technology education in particular. Practical implications The model should also be of help for practitioners, i.e. teachers and facilitators working in informal learning spaces for developing children's digital education in practice. Social implications The commentary addresses significant societal issues. It is actually not only children who should be empowered to engage in making and shaping our digital futures, but people in general.

The aim of this study is to discuss its effectiveness as a strategy for developing Media Education. The 16 activities we have collected are mostly targeted at the school population and show an emphasis on media production, a dimension that is often not considered part of formal learning, which is more focused on reading than on writing. The results lead us to raise questions about the importance of non-formal education. Interestingly, most of these initiatives have been designed to take place in the school context and are, in various ways, supported by the Ministry of Education, a situation which blurs the boundaries between formal and non-formal learning. The analysis of the data leads us to this specific recommendation: these initiatives should be formally evaluated in order to understand their real impact on the acquisition of news media education skills. ; ESF -European Science Foundation(SFRH\\/BPD\\/92204\\/2013) ...\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"Media education; Digital literacy; Competitions; Formal; Non-formal; Education; Formal and non-formal education; Ci\\u00eancias Sociais::Ci\\u00eancias da Comunica\\u00e7\\u00e3o\",\"subject\":\"Media education; Digital literacy; Competitions; Formal; Non-formal; Education; Formal and non-formal education;\",\"authors\":\"Pereira, Lu\\u00eds; Jorge, Ana; Brites, Maria Jos\\u00e9\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1822\\/45250\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"de8a1bbe7dbd026032bf02f6439ecd5beaa3cc32d50f237845b6ff3ae12bfce6\",\"relevance\":102,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"35ce8eb1f232e10bea8c7516ccb5344dfbf5b0df8c22ff21278872371c51ff1f\",\"relation\":\"Globalisation, Societies and Education Vol. 16, Issue 1, p. 49-65; 10.1080\\/14767724.2017.1356701\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.13\\/1404922\",\"title\":\"#Eduresistance: a critical analysis of the role of digital media in collective struggles for public education in the USA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"From Facebook-coordinated high-school walkouts to compelling Internet-based protest art that has accompanied recent teacher strikes, grassroots education activism in the USA has gone digital. Despite the proliferation of research on the mediatisation of education policy, few studies have explored the ways in which activists for public education engage with Web 2.0 technologies. This paper makes a contribution to this under-researched area by exploring selected activist accounts including Parents Across America, United Opt Out National, and the PS 2013 campaign in New York City. I draw on critical, feminist, and cultural studies theories of education and social movement media to analyse activist media practices in a policy and political milieu dominated by corporate media and neoliberal governance structures. The analysis reveals that progressive education activists strategically deploy digital media to amplify voice, build collective identity, and disseminate alternative knowledge to enable direct action. A situated analysis also reveals significant differences in activist media practice which are shaped by particular political histories and geographies. The paper concludes with a discussion about future lines of inquiry into the role of digital media in collective struggles for public education.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"social media; education policy; social movements; community organising; activist media\",\"subject\":\"social media; education policy; social movements; community organising; activist media\",\"authors\":\"Thapliyal, Nisha\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.13\\/1404922\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"35ce8eb1f232e10bea8c7516ccb5344dfbf5b0df8c22ff21278872371c51ff1f\",\"relevance\":101,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"52200df57be0c207c2bdb688f51b2501e08c04c3020ff5fb0e864a70e4b74273\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/hdl\\/11588\\/885360; issue:3; firstpage:559; lastpage:578; numberofpages:20; journal:RIVISTA DI DIGITAL POLITICS; urn:ISSN:2785-0072; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11588\\/885360; doi:10.53227\\/103805; https:\\/\\/www.rivisteweb.it\\/doi\\/10.53227\\/103805\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11588\\/885360; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.53227\\/103805; https:\\/\\/www.rivisteweb.it\\/doi\\/10.53227\\/103805\",\"title\":\"La digital education delle Forze armate italiane: modello attuale e prospettive future\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In close co-operation with the University of Turin, Italian Armed forces (Afs) have been introducing e-learning as a training method for their personnel for some years, making extensive use of Moocs and developing progressively a specific digital education model, based on particular management characteristics, as well as on specialized personnel, able to respond to servicemen\\u2019s lifelong learning needs.

These include a lack of clear categorization of digital health education in the literature; constantly evolving concepts, pedagogies, or theories; and a multitude of methods, features, technologies, or delivery settings. The Digital Health Education Collaboration was established to evaluate the evidence on digital education in health professions; inform policymakers, educators, and students; and ultimately, change the way in which these professionals learn and are taught. The aim of this paper is to present the overarching methodology that we use to synthesize evidence across our digital health education reviews and to discuss challenges related to the process. For our research, we followed Cochrane recommendations for the conduct of systematic reviews; all reviews are reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidance. This included assembling experts in various digital health education fields; identifying gaps in the evidence base; formulating focused research questions, aims, and outcome measures; choosing appropriate search terms and databases; defining inclusion and exclusion criteria; running the searches jointly with librarians and information specialists; managing abstracts; retrieving full-text versions of papers; extracting and storing large datasets, critically appraising the quality of studies; analyzing data; discussing findings; drawing meaningful conclusions; and drafting research papers. The approach used for synthesizing evidence from digital health education trials is commonly regarded as the most rigorous benchmark for conducting systematic reviews. Although we acknowledge the presence of certain biases ingrained in the process, we have clearly highlighted and minimized those biases by strictly adhering to scientific rigor, methodological integrity, and standard operating procedures. This paper will be a valuable asset for researchers and methodologists undertaking systematic reviews in digital health education. ; Public Health and primary care ; Prevention, Population and Disease management (PrePoD)\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Medical Internet Research\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"methods; education; medical; systematic reviews; evidence-based; distance; professional\",\"subject\":\"methods; education; medical; systematic reviews; evidence-based; distance; professional\",\"authors\":\"Car, J.; Carlstedt-Duke, J.; Car, L.T.; Posadzki, P.; Whiting, P.; Zary, N.; Atun, R.; Majeed, A.; Campbell, J.; Digital Hlth Educ Collaboration\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1887\\/3195239\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"713ecda02e296b1e792349ac678bcb8a47e7783125481f90db2f001fa7dd5f39\",\"relevance\":99,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9896f296be6b745fbc5d9d06d3cd40b1204ffb410c546d7117e142c907d2b436\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/revistes.ub.edu\\/index.php\\/der\\/article\\/view\\/16104\\/pdf; Ballast, K.

Therefore, medical students should be confronted with digital health during their medical education. However, corresponding teaching formats and concepts are still largely lacking in the medical curricula. Objective: This study aims to introduce digital health as a curricular module at a German medical school and to identify undergraduate medical competencies in digital health and their suitable teaching methods. Methods: We developed a 3-week curricular module on digital health for third-year medical students at a large German medical school, taking place for the first time in January 2020. Semistructured interviews with 5 digital health experts were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an abductive approach. We obtained feedback from the participating students and lecturers of the module through a 17-item survey questionnaire. Results: The module received overall positive feedback from both students and lecturers who expressed the need for further digital health education and stated that the field is very important for clinical care and is underrepresented in the current medical curriculum. We extracted a detailed overview of digital health competencies, skills, and knowledge to teach the students from the expert interviews. They also contained suggestions for teaching methods and statements supporting the urgency of the implementation of digital health education in the mandatory curriculum. Conclusions: An elective class seems to be a suitable format for the timely introduction of digital health education.

My inquiry is part of a larger project entitled, Developing Mobile Media Spaces for Civic Engagement in Urban Priority Schools, located in Ottawa, Canada that is supported by Social Sciences and Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) Insight Grant.\",\"published_in\":\"Digital Culture & Education, Vol 9, Iss 1, Pp 1-13 (2017)\",\"year\":\"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"teacher education; urban schools; digital citizenship; currere; film; cosmopolitanism; Education; L; Education (General); L7-991; Technology; T; Information technology; T58.5-58.64\",\"subject\":\"teacher education; urban schools; digital citizenship; currere; film; cosmopolitanism; Education; L; Technology; T; Information technology;; 5-\",\"authors\":\"Linda Radford\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7fc65381d0eb41a89386e89d6cf4056b\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"969a19c0f4db120364de5ffcb7019cbf040bdda52de64817636758a6df2c3fa5\",\"relevance\":95,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"8738cc9be4f7f89ae039a9fda4c78f85dcd4a3aafb07619f1114854007123c98\",\"relation\":\"Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education--0159-6306 Vol. 33 Issue. 1 pp: 1-3\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/01596306.2012.632156; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.7\\/uws:13943\",\"title\":\"Education and the politics of becoming\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The future that Gilles Deleuze envisaged in conversation with Antonio Negri in 1990 is already upon us.

In a postdigital era, blurred boundaries between digital technologies and physical reality place new demands on citizenship, teacher education institutions (TEIs), and teacher educators (TEDs). This paper explores Swedish TEDs\\u2019 views of digital citizenship and the professional digital competence (PDC) required for teaching subject student teachers to teach for digital citizenship. Seven TEIs participated and 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted with TEDs teaching a Core Education Subjects module on education and democracy mandatory for all student teachers. TEDs generally believe that the digitalization of society impacts the democratic assignment and addressing this requires specific PDC. Conceptualizations of digital citizenship tend to foreground source criticism as well as ethical, safe, and sound use of digital technologies, and to some degree also (im-)material means of democratic participation. While generally believing that TE should address questions relating to digital citizenship and that TEDs have an important role in this regard, digital technologies are discussed in the module coincidentally and TEDs are unsure to what degree student teachers receive such training. Challenges include lack of time and unclear Degree Objectives. To develop TEDs\\u2019 PDC to include questions relating to digital citizenship in their teaching, support is needed through policy and continuous professional development for TEDs, including reviews of course content and program structure. Future TE research needs to explore digital citizenship in the school subject social studies.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital citizenship; Professional digital competence; Teacher education; Postdigital; Democratic assignment; Pedagogical Work; Pedagogiskt arbete\",\"subject\":\"Digital citizenship; Professional digital competence; Teacher education; Postdigital; Democratic assignment; Pedagogical Work; Pedagogiskt arbete\",\"authors\":\"\\u00d6rtegren, Alex\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/urn.kb.se\\/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:umu:diva-192591\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"e217b9ddb0feb0bf2195eada7a85c334d820e8830ed607a618e0ceb11d15a395\",\"relevance\":78,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"0c5c0d9d2063b0bad7496c250dab67dab111fa07cc79cff584287ad8ccf01b0f\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dt.giac.by\\/jour\\/article\\/view\\/113; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2522-9613; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2524-2822; 2522-9613; 2524-2822; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/960d7d6de0fe4cc48f3e046d11e79811\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/960d7d6de0fe4cc48f3e046d11e79811\",\"title\":\"Formation of the Management Information System in the Education Sector and the Development of the Education System of the Republic of Belarus Based on the Experience of Estonia\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The article considers the issues of formation and maintenance of an integrated information management system in the education sector, as well as the development of e-education on the example of the Republic of Estonia \\u2014 a regional and one of the world leaders in the field of digital transformation of education.

Additionally, the study aimed to reveal differences among the aforementioned dimensions\\u2019 scores. In order to achieve this, the study\\u2019s participants attended a course on theoretical and technological process and tools implemented in digital story creation. A total of 46 digital stories were scored via a rubric and then analyzed. From the analysis, only the content dimension received a high score, whilst all other dimensions were scored at the medium level. The results revealed a significant difference among the digital storytelling dimensions, with mechanics, story structure, and use of technology dimensions negatively differentiated from content and planning. These findings support the use of digital storytelling content that is primarily based on the use of technology and basic digital storytelling principles for science teacher education programs. From this point of view, it can be strongly said that both in field education courses and for instructional technology and vocational courses, the potential for preservice teachers to graduate with having acquired higher skill levels may be realized through digital storytelling. So, teacher education programs should be supported by digital storytelling activities and instructions.\",\"published_in\":\"Science Education International, Vol 33, Iss 2, Pp 251-263 (2022)\",\"year\":\"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital storytelling; science education; teacher education; technology in education; Theory and practice of education; LB5-3640; Science; Q\",\"subject\":\"digital storytelling; science education; teacher education; technology in education; Theory and practice of education; Science; Q\",\"authors\":\"Derya Orhan G\\u00f6ks\\u00fcn; G\\u00fclden G\\u00fcrsoy\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.33828\\/sei.v33.i2.13\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"b2a28ce45345800da1bf2f9698bd77174ef02c6d67f294e5006769810ec2ee83\",\"relevance\":70,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.33828\\/sei.v33.i2.13\"},{\"id\":\"347dfd1a5b63ec2b7ba074eb3471f5103f00c63e35c8dbfdae1245adedac92a2\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2019.00128\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2504-284X; 2504-284X; doi:10.3389\\/feduc.2019.00128; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2be5d8299e604d93919826b4cff6a8a8\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2019.00128; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2be5d8299e604d93919826b4cff6a8a8\",\"title\":\"Affective Learning in Digital Education\\u2014Case Studies of Social Networking Systems, Games for Learning, and Digital Fabrication\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Technological innovations, such as social networking systems, games for learning, and digital fabrication, are extending learning and interaction opportunities of people in educational and professional contexts. These technological transformations have the ability to deepen, enrich, and adaptively guide learning and interaction, but they also hold potential risks for neglecting people's affective learning processes\\u2014that is, learners' emotional experiences and expressions in learning. We argue that technologies and their usage in particular should be designed with the goal of enhancing learning and interaction that acknowledges both fundamental aspects of learning: cognitive and affective. In our empirical research, we have explored the possibility of using various types of emerging digital tools as individual and group support for cognitively effortful and affectively meaningful learning. We present four case studies of experiments dealing with social networking systems, programming with computer games, and \\u201cmakers culture\\u201d and digital fabrication as examples of digital education. All these experiments investigate novel ways of technological integration in learning by focusing on their affective potential. In the first study, a social networking system was used in a higher education context for providing a forum for online learning. The second study demonstrates a Minecraft experiment as game-based learning in primary school education. Finally, the third and the fourth case study showcases examples of \\u201cmaker\\u201d contexts and digital fabrication in early education and in secondary school. It is concluded that digital systems and tools can provide multiple opportunities for affective learning in different contexts within different age groups. As a pedagogical implication, scaffolding in both cognitive and affective learning processes is necessary in order to make the learning experience with emerging digital tools meaningful and engaging.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Education, Vol 4 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"affective learning; collaborative learning; digital education; digital fabrication; maker education; social networking systems; Education (General); L7-991\",\"subject\":\"affective learning; collaborative learning; digital education; digital fabrication; maker education; social networking systems; \",\"authors\":\"Piia N\\u00e4ykki; Jari Laru; Essi Vuopala; Pirkko Siklander; Sanna J\\u00e4rvel\\u00e4\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2019.00128\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"347dfd1a5b63ec2b7ba074eb3471f5103f00c63e35c8dbfdae1245adedac92a2\",\"relevance\":69,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2019.00128\"},{\"id\":\"2bd2720ac96289b21d6d50ea9d3406425645ec550f74f07de7b03e696e2c1296\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2227-7102\\/11\\/8\\/402; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2227-7102; doi:10.3390\\/educsci11080402; 2227-7102; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5e5e42d35980413f9692388980b7f059\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/educsci11080402; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5e5e42d35980413f9692388980b7f059\",\"title\":\"Digital Competence Assessment Methods in Higher Education: A Systematic Literature Review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The rapid increase in recent years in the number of different digital competency frameworks, models, and strategies has prompted an increasing popularity for making the argument in favor of the need to evaluate and assess digital competence. To support the process of digital competence assessment, it is consequently necessary to understand the different approaches and methods. This paper carries out a systematic literature review and includes an analysis of the existing proposals and conceptions of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education, with the aim of better understanding the field of research. The review follows three objectives: (i) describe the characteristics of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education; (ii) provide an overview of current trends; and, finally, (iii) identify challenges and issues in digital competence assessment in higher education with a focus on the reliability and validity of the proposed methods. On the basis of the findings, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital competence assessment in higher education requires more attention, with a specific focus on instrument validity and reliability. Furthermore, it will be of great importance to further investigate the use of assessment tools to support systematic digital competence assessment processes.

Previous research has highlighted limitations in technological access in rural areas and the importance of mobile phones for transitions. Whilst universities offer wide-ranging digital support, there remains a tendency towards universalist mechanisms. Drawing on a longitudinal study across three universities, and employing Holland\\u2019s theory of figured worlds, we highlight rural students\\u2019 experiences of digital transitions across different cultural worlds, prior to university and once they arrive, including the bewildering technocratic systems and practices and resulting conflicts and positionings encountered. We show how students improvise to decode the digital university and figure out new practices. Decolonisation of universities involves rethinking the \\u2018technocratic consciousness\\u2019 (both colonialist and neoliberal) and its apparatus including digital systems and structures. For rural students to become successful digital practitioners in higher education, universities should acknowledge prior digital experience and forms of knowledge and focus on expanding individual and collective agency in supporting transitions, as mechanisms for shaping a decolonised digital education.\",\"published_in\":\"Timmis , S & Muhuro , P 2019 , ' De-coding or de-colonising the technocratic university?

Digital storytelling, as both a teaching method and a learning resource, has been applied in many innovative ways at all levels of education. Digital storytelling supports student learning and allows teachers to adopt innovative and improved teaching methods. Storytelling is a proven and popular pedagogy, while digital storytelling is relatively recent and still seldom used in the setting of early childhood education. Using a case study of a storytelling\\u2013art\\u2013science club in Jakarta, Indonesia, the researcher explored how and why digital storytelling is used in early childhood education. This club is one of the few organizations that use digital storytelling for teaching and learning programs in early childhood. Data were collected qualitatively using in-depth interviews with four teachers, document analysis, and twice-observations of storytelling activities in each session with 35 and 37 children. The collected data were analyzed using analytical memoing methods. The results indicate that teachers in this club used digital storytelling for several important reasons. They claimed that simple digital technology made storytelling more entertaining, captivating, engaging, communicative and theatrical. This study suggests that the ability of teachers to use digital technology should be enhanced; schools' information and communication technology (ICT) devices should be equipped; some funding should also be allocated by the government to modernize school equipment; while the curriculum should be tailored to meet technological developments, and provide opportunities for children to learn how to make good use of technology.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Child Care and Education Policy, Vol 15, Iss 1, Pp 1-20 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital storytelling; Early childhood education; ICT; Educational technology; Education (General); L7-991; Special aspects of education; LC8-6691\",\"subject\":\"Digital storytelling; Early childhood education; ICT; Educational technology; Special aspects of education; \",\"authors\":\"Maila D.

Our daily lives are intertwined with digital technologies like social media, smart-phone, tablets and e-commerce just to name a few. It is worrying that India does not have any world class institution of higher learning and that the key indicators of business education were not encouraging. The world is witnessing knowledge explosion but India is lagging behind in terms of quality and universal education. We are no doubt a great and upcoming nation, that being the position, we have far greater challenges compared to the developed countries. The government is keen to create world-class universities. It must understand that world-class institutes are not created; they evolve over decades and centuries, nurtured by respect for knowledge, policy and adequate funds. Contrary to the global trend, pioneering educational institutions of India languish and decay, instead of evolving to greatness.

Particularly vocational schools are obviously under pressure to deal with changes due to digitalization in many sectors and professions. One reason why technology-based learning is still underdeveloped in schools could be the insufficient digital competences of teachers. Presently most teachers gain their knowledge on how to use digital media for learning and teaching informally.

Based on the theory of learning by design and digital literacies theory, this study attempts to construct the digital literacies teaching model from the curriculum, instruction and evaluation aspects. It is argued that the difficulty of current digital literacies task design lies on how to handle curriculum integration. Digital literacies courses should make use of digital resources available inside and outside the classroom contexts with reference to the unique features of language and culture. Through curriculum integration, interaction and multi-modal self-learning and cooperative learning, digital resources can be fully utilized. Moreover, classroom teaching should involve digital resources to enhance the language context. With explicit instruction and guidance, teachers should encourage learners to transfer their learning to the digital context. Lastly, evaluators should take into account the achievement of language objectives related to language, information and technology.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Curriculum Studies, Vol 13, Iss 1, Pp 93-109 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u6559\\u5b78\\u6a21\\u5f0f; \\u9700\\u6c42\\u5206\\u6790; \\u8ab2\\u7a0b; \\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u80fd\\u529b; Keywords: teaching model; needs analysis; curriculum; digital literacies; Education; L; Theory and practice of education; LB5-3640\",\"subject\":\"\\u6559\\u5b78\\u6a21\\u5f0f; \\u9700\\u6c42\\u5206\\u6790; \\u8ab2\\u7a0b; \\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u80fd\\u529b; Keywords: teaching model; needs analysis; curriculum; digital literacies; Education; L; Theory and practice of education; \",\"authors\":\"\\u738b\\u6a02 Le Wang; \\u9ea5\\u9673\\u6dd1\\u8ce2 Barley Mak\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3966\\/181653382018031301005\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"fea30e952cae89fc3c7cef6b10f37577621726b88e3661528149ae4062c13770\",\"relevance\":23,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3966\\/181653382018031301005\"},{\"id\":\"b1b7b0cb4bf92a7e9e1bd707703a545a518cc64b5329fb88faa521e057b4dce9\",\"relation\":\"Handley, F.J.L.

However, be it opportunity or hype, digital transformation impacts every part of our human life, where we especially see and experience it in numerous areas of social life, including education. Based on these arguments, this paper examines the research that has been conducted on digital transformation from the perspective of education by applying data mining and analytics approaches. Accordingly, in the examination of research papers on digital transformation, five emerging broad themes were identified: (1) strategies and technologies as pillars of digital transformation in social development, (2) digital transformation as a vision that goes beyond mere adaptation of technology, (3) innovative technologies as change agents of digital transformation, (4) the COVID-19 pandemic as a catalyst for digital transformation, ... : Bozkurt, A., & Sharma, R.

The Digital Sabbath practice aimed to explore the feasibility of switching off from technology and the impact of this practice on the participants, and those around them. The Digital Sabbath and Digital Distraction exhibition results from a creative arts research project involving graduate art teachers and art education lecturers who communicate well visually. The project followed the experiences of nine participants (including the researchers) as they gave up access to digital technologies for a day a week over a three-month period, a practice known as Digital Sabbath (DS). The participants\\u2019 narratives (artefacts, journals and interviews) formed the stimulus for visualisations of the Digital Sabbath experience after a pre-intervention survey. Each researcher developed a series of works with participants, documenting the nature of their experiences and affective responses to the process. The researchers are creating a large collaborative piece that documents general themes from the project experience. The artworks produced for this research aim to communicate the findings of the research with a broader audience, and to incite discussion around our use of technology and its effect on our lives.

In 2006, the European Union defined digital competence as one of eight key competences for lifelong learning. The terms digital literacies and digital competence have since been used interchangeably, particularly in policy documents concerning education and the digitalization of educational systems and teaching. However, whether these concepts carry similar meanings, and are understood in a similar way, across languages and cultures is not self-evident. By taking the curricula in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway as examples, this article attempts to clarify similarities and differences in how the concepts are interpreted, as well as what implications this has for the digitalization of education. The analyses reveal that different terms are used in the curricula in the different countries, which are connected to themes or interdisciplinary issues to be incorporated into school subjects. The conceptualizations of the terms share a common emphasis on societal issues and a critical approach, highlighting a particular Nordic interpretation of digital literacies and digital competence.\",\"published_in\":\"Media and Communication; Vol 7, No 2 (2019): Critical Perspectives on Digital Literacies: Creating a Path Forward; 25-35 ; 2183-2439\",\"year\":\"2019-06-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"bildung; curricula; digital competence; digital literacies; education; literacy\",\"subject\":\"bildung; curricula; digital competence; digital literacies; education; literacy\",\"authors\":\"Godhe, Anna-Lena\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.cogitatiopress.com\\/mediaandcommunication\\/article\\/view\\/1888\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"e85fc43c429c954a2c9de36893a9f7287432d25ac7a650398868fa2064b948d6\",\"relevance\":16,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"a396640708c3dd7201ae9d51e6b19a1e06a7a448cb57a57cf48b762872655fc1\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ssoar.info\\/ssoar\\/handle\\/document\\/47231; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17645\\/mac.v3i4.335\",\"title\":\"Media Literacy in Montenegro\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Few countries in the world have introduced media education into their curriculums.

The focus is on the results of research conducted through in-depth interviews with media literacy teachers all over the country. Despite the many challenges, all teachers identify the potential of media education to strengthen some of the key competences of the students and to improve their motivation and academic performance. They also identify potential to change positively school culture by transforming teachers into \\u201ccultural mediators\\u201d (Morcellini, 2007) and by supporting the formation of a \\u201cparticipative culture\\u201d (Jenkins & Kelley, 2013) in schools.

Guiding the analysis is the notion of \\u2018problem\\u2019 understood as central for Google for Education\\u2019s success story. The case of Sweden, in which Google for Education has become widely used, forms the vantage point for this discussion. The study makes visible how Google for Education, in the commercial rhetoric, is constructed as the solution to problem representations by being positioned as a much-needed bridge, in the shape of digital information infrastructure, between digital policy and educational practice. However, Google for Education is far from simply a practical solution to a set of expensive and urgent problems. To uncritically embrace Google as the information infrastructure of education is to hand over power to one actor, which closes doors to alternative paths of doing and knowing in education.\",\"published_in\":\"European Educational Research Journal ; page 147490412199721 ; ISSN 1474-9041 1474-9041\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education\",\"subject\":\"Education\",\"authors\":\"Carlsson, Hanna\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1474904121997213\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"1295f506baa2a2db913d4161f24989cb67ba39ed471424c09a50298b4be3efde\",\"relevance\":14,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1474904121997213\"},{\"id\":\"f3c4080748ff75fe665876b2fde6c738f240a638f8831948c02c90c62c95a948\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/openrepository.ru\\/article?id=246168\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/openrepository.ru\\/article?id=246168\",\"title\":\"Socio-Managerial and Socio-Cultural Problems of Integration of Education, Science and Business in a Digital Society\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The article highlights socio-managerial and socio-cultural problems of integration of education, science and business in a digital society, defines the role of information technology in the development of intercultural interaction within current higher school in the context of a digital society.

The education sector, modernized by digital technologies, is becoming much more efficient. Digital technologies allow to intensify the educational process, make it mobile, differentiated and adapted to modern realities. Moreover, digital technologies are able to ensure continuity of learning in the face of unpredictable impacts (military conflicts, diseases or pandemics). That is why this topic is relevant among European and American educators.The article clarifies the meaning of the terms \\u201cdigitization\\u201d, \\u201cdigitalization\\u201d, \\u201cdigital transformation\\u201d. Although the terms are highly specialized and fundamentally different, they are often used as synonyms.The author also outlines the theoretical and conceptual framework of the digital transformation of education in the views of European and American researchers. The modern concept of digital transformation of education is based on the approach to the consideration of digital technologies as a reflection of the modern paradigm of social development when competitiveness and efficiency appear as essential qualities. Today, almost every social sector is leveraging the Internet and digital technology. Thanks to technology and digitalization, we are approaching the latest industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0. It also affects education, which is undergoing an evolutionary process (from Education 1.0 to Education 4.0). The driving force of students is recognized as important in the digital transformation of education. Today\\u2019s students have changed radically, they think and process information differently than their predecessors, and prefer teaching methods that are more active and specific to them.It is concluded that the digital transformation of education involves a fundamentally new format of the educational environment. The use of digital technologies is a mechanism for ensuring efficiency and increasing productivity in the educational process, and the digital transformation of education appears as a key factor in improving the education system. ; \\u0417\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u0441\\u0443\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f \\u0446\\u0438\\u0444\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0445

In particular, it argues that there is an urgent need for the higher education community to develop more sophisticated understandings of the nature of the digital divisions that exist within current cohorts of university students - not least inequalities of \\u00bfeffective' use of ICT to access information and knowledge. With these thoughts in mind, the paper presents a review of recent research and theoretical work in the area of digital exclusion and the digital divide, and considers a number of reasons why digital exclusion remains a complex and entrenched social problem within populations of higher education students. ; Aunque muchos autores ya rechazan con seguridad la noci\\u00f3n de brecha digital, este documento razona que las desigualdades en el uso de las TIC en la educaci\\u00f3n superior contempor\\u00e1nea tienen una importancia creciente en lugar de decreciente.

Data was collected in three intervals over a two-year period: a web questionnaire about digital curation knowledge and skills and interest in continuing professional development (CPD); nine interviews with individuals who engaged in digital curation work about workplace challenges and CPD education; and a final online questionnaire about preferences for digital curation CPD education. Findings suggest that Ireland-specific issues emerged: (a) because there is so little understanding about digital curation in Ireland, even among information professionals, individuals were not always sure when they were doing digital curation work and if they needed to learn more and; (b) individuals were often the only ones in their institutions with digital curation skills and found themselves struggling to educate supervisors and colleagues about the necessity of their work as well as the resources needed to conduct their work. Considering these findings, comprehensive postgraduate digital curation education in Ireland would need to include a focus on these issues. ; Archives and Records Association\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-02-28T14:35:28Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Professional development; Archival education; Continuing professional development; Case study\",\"subject\":\"Professional development; Archival education; Continuing professional development; Case study\",\"authors\":\"Cushing, Amber; Shankar, Kalpana\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10197\\/9624\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"4c863c2f28c72867ac40198950afddd7279e1c5cd4f8b7c9635c9e68b8dc1cb2\",\"relevance\":2,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2e9053f7c9a90cf8478b11c2ef0a7d5aafb53c899708e4401ee2177e8b22020a\",\"relation\":\"Australasian Journal of Technology Education; Fox-Turnbull, W.
