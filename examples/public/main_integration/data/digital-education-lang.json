The sample comprised 1,126 specialists in Information Technology, Computer Technology, Computer Education, Computer Science, and Computer Engineering working in public higher education instructions throughout the country. The selection was the result of multi-stage random sampling from 76 public higher education instructions that offer undergraduate education. The instrument was a questionnaire form on essential digital competency components for undergraduate students in higher education institutions. The question items employed a 7-point Likert scale and showed Cronbach\\u2019s alpha values for the content validity and reliability at a range of.93-.97 per domain and .87-.99 per component. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics for general data and 2nd Order CFA analysis. The findings revealed that from 24 observed variables, there were 7 competency components.: 1) Fundamental of digital; 2) Accessing digital information; 3) Using digital information; 4) Creating digital information and media; 5) Communicating digital information; 6) Managing digital information; and 7) Evaluating digital information.

Some examples of student work related to the acquisition of digital skills are shown.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-01-12T14:18:08Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Tecnolog\\u00eda Educativa; Competencia digital; Competencias del docente; Formaci\\u00f3n del profesorado; Educational Technology; Digital competence; Teacher qualifications; Teacher education\",\"subject\":\"Tecnolog\\u00eda Educativa; Competencia digital; Competencias del docente; Formaci\\u00f3n del profesorado; Educational Technology; Digital competence; Teacher qualifications; Teacher education\",\"authors\":\"Aristizabal Llorente, Pilar; Cruz Iglesias, Esther\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/idus.us.es\\/xmlui\\/handle\\/11441\\/68940\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"119812ba34b725795691e22d5339e00d46277121067311fb77af48de801b5dfb\",\"relevance\":16,\"lang_detected\":\"spanish\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital competence, Teacher education, Competencia digital\",\"x\":\"-0.224873525442248\",\"y\":\"0.0937780639643449\",\"area_uri\":11,\"area\":\"Digital competence, Teacher education, Competencia digital\"},{\"id\":\"1282221387e8cc15773fab0a2bf58882228f09abfd955f40659d2773644d0a66\",\"relation\":\"Media and Communication;2; 7; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2043\\/28731\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2043\\/28731\",\"title\":\"Digital Literacies or Digital Competence : Conceptualizations in Nordic Curricula\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article examines how the concepts of digital literacies and digital competence are conceptualized in curricula for compulsory education within the Nordic countries. In 2006, the European Union defined digital competence as one of eight key competences for lifelong learning. The terms digital literacies and digital competence have since been used interchangeably, particularly in policy documents concerning education and the digitalization of educational systems and teaching. However, whether these concepts carry similar meanings, and are understood in a similar way, across languages and cultures is not self-evident. By taking the curricula in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway as examples, this article attempts to clarify similarities and differences in how the concepts are interpreted, as well as what implications this has for the digitalization of education. The analyses reveal that different terms are used in the curricula in the different countries, which are connected to themes or interdisciplinary issues to be incorporated into school subjects. The conceptualizations of the terms share a common emphasis on societal issues and a critical approach, highlighting a particular Nordic interpretation of digital literacies and digital competence.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"bildung; digital competence; digital literacy\",\"subject\":\"bildung; digital competence; digital literacy\",\"authors\":\"Godhe, Anna-Lena\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2043\\/28731\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1282221387e8cc15773fab0a2bf58882228f09abfd955f40659d2773644d0a66\",\"relevance\":57,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital competence, Teacher education, Competencia digital\",\"x\":\"-0.201490269043802\",\"y\":\"-0.0150414634192541\",\"area_uri\":11,\"area\":\"Digital competence, Teacher education, Competencia digital\"},{\"id\":\"1423fdc724803ca0bfdd54355e0ab989e193bad7ec039e7f6ffc1121728a0a0c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/revistas.uam.es\\/tendenciaspedagogicas\\/article\\/view\\/7082\\/7440\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/revistas.uam.es\\/tendenciaspedagogicas\\/article\\/view\\/7082\",\"title\":\"Presentation of the monograph: Technologies, Education and Digital Divide ; Presentaci\\u00f3n del Monogr\\u00e1fico: Tecnolog\\u00edas, Educaci\\u00f3n y Brecha Digital\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Presentation of the monograph of Tendencias Pedag\\u00f3gicas devoted to \\\"Technologies, Education and Digital Divide\\\". ; Presentaci\\u00f3n del Monogr\\u00e1fico de Tendencias Pedag\\u00f3gicas dedicado a \\\"Tecnolog\\u00edas, Educaci\\u00f3n y Brecha Digital\\\".\",\"published_in\":\"Tendencias Pedag\\u00f3gicas; Vol. 29 (2017): Tecnolog\\u00edas, educaci\\u00f3n y brecha digital; 7-8 ; 1989-8614 ; 1133-2654 ; 10.15366\\/tp2017.29\",\"year\":\"2017-01-17\",\"subject_orig\":\"technologies; education; digital divide; tecnolog\\u00edas; educaci\\u00f3n; brecha digital\",\"subject\":\"technologies; education; digital divide; tecnolog\\u00edas; educaci\\u00f3n; brecha digital\",\"authors\":\"G\\u00f3mez, Melchor\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/revistas.uam.es\\/tendenciaspedagogicas\\/article\\/view\\/7082\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"1423fdc724803ca0bfdd54355e0ab989e193bad7ec039e7f6ffc1121728a0a0c\",\"relevance\":82,\"lang_detected\":\"spanish\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital age, Academic dishonesty, Brecha digital\",\"x\":\"-0.237799052260738\",\"y\":\"0.148999639513947\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Digital age, Academic dishonesty, Brecha digital\"},{\"id\":\"15e63fc6c5dfa228a39433f46c271946c8cf45f566bb63036ed89f66ce66a5e7\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.research.manchester.ac.uk\\/portal\\/en\\/publications\\/conceptualizing-digital-literacies-and-digital-ethics-for-sustainability-education(d99555d3-f49c-4ca4-87ae-ee4a1e8abcad).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1108\\/IJSHE-08-2012-0078\",\"title\":\"Conceptualizing digital literacies and digital ethics for sustainability education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose \\u2013 The purpose of this paper is to discuss the need for integrating a focus on digital literacies and digital ethics into sustainability education, proposing a conceptualization of these for sustainability education.

Transformation of an education system takes more than a simplistic hardware solution. Revolutions need leaders and leaders need vision.

In youth leisure, computers are more than information devices: they convey stories, images, identities, and fantasies through providing imaginative opportunities for play, and as cultural and ideological forms. In this paper, I report on a project conducted with teacher education students at a university in Johannesburg, South Africa. The focus of the project is to examine how students construct their identities digitally through the multimodal narratives they create in the English classroom. To do this I report on two narratives, as well as a recurring theme, decolonisation. The latter theme is significant because it was during the time of this project that South African universities found themselves in the grip of decolonisation and free education protests. I use New Literacy Studies as a framework to theorise literacy practices, and the work of Hall and others to theorise identity. The paper presents further possible implications of digital identity construction for teaching and learning.Keywords: decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"published_in\":\"South African Journal of Education; Vol 38, No 2 (2018); 1-9 ; 2076-3433 ; 0256-0100\",\"year\":\"2018-06-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"subject\":\"decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"authors\":\"Kajee, Leila\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ajol.info\\/index.php\\/saje\\/article\\/view\\/173120\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"23f1739d2f39a41b3aebb4e7d3dbf751ba9741d5c2957bf88dd59684c8236bb4\",\"relevance\":42,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital citizenship, Digital education revolution, Digital literacies\",\"x\":\"-0.170670201247709\",\"y\":\"0.0368930315330495\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Digital citizenship, Digital education revolution, Digital literacies\"},{\"id\":\"255431ea0964dee1eea14564e2820060498851ec19acdde3694a2035cb29a1d8\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.ru.lv\\/index.php\\/ER\\/article\\/view\\/4213\\/4188; http:\\/\\/journals.ru.lv\\/index.php\\/ER\\/article\\/view\\/4213; doi:10.17770\\/er2019.1.4213\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.ru.lv\\/index.php\\/ER\\/article\\/view\\/4213; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17770\\/er2019.1.4213\",\"title\":\"DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF LEARNING CONCEPTUAL ASPECTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Media and new technologies integration into the learning process of higher educational institutions stimulates the necessity for the development of digital competence.

Despite the proliferation of research on the mediatisation of education policy, few studies have explored the ways in which activists for public education engage with Web 2.0 technologies. This paper makes a contribution to this under-researched area by exploring selected activist accounts including Parents Across America, United Opt Out National, and the PS 2013 campaign in New York City. I draw on critical, feminist, and cultural studies theories of education and social movement media to analyse activist media practices in a policy and political milieu dominated by corporate media and neoliberal governance structures. The analysis reveals that progressive education activists strategically deploy digital media to amplify voice, build collective identity, and disseminate alternative knowledge to enable direct action. A situated analysis also reveals significant differences in activist media practice which are shaped by particular political histories and geographies.

The findings show that the students\\u2019 socioeconomic status influences the level of skills development. The relationship between SES and students\\u2019 skills shows the presence of the digital divide in higher education that increases learning inequalities.

All the online interactions between learners and tutors, the description, creation, reuse and sharing of educational digital resources and the interlinkage between them in conjunction with cheap storage technology has led to an enormous amount of educational data. Medical education is a unique type of education due to accuracy of information needed, continuous changing competences required and alternative methods of education used. Nowadays medical education standards provide the ground for organizing the educational data and the paradata. Analysis of such education data through education data mining techniques is in its infancy, but decision support systems for medical education need further research. To the best of our knowledge, there is a gap and a clear need for identifying the challenges for decision support systems in medical education in the era of medical education standards. Thus, in this paper the role and the attributes of such a decision support system for medical education are delineated and the challenges and vision for future actions are identified.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-02-23\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"decision support; important medical; medical education\",\"authors\":\"Konstantinidis, Stathis; Bamidis, Panagiotis\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.nottingham.ac.uk\\/32306\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"45b79c7c65d0c6d5604ba73bd6e5a2a8f86afae56a8a237313a1d027b6ba6763\",\"relevance\":33,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Decision support, Digital food education, Education revolution\",\"x\":\"0.142269921172594\",\"y\":\"-0.0197645616188\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Decision support, Digital food education, Education revolution\"},{\"id\":\"563a159d0b24c044f30b141740a3b30155be04b386cc381d0205447f15957af2\",\"relation\":\"issn:1038-6130\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/espace.library.uq.edu.au\\/view\\/UQ:11316\\/quinn99.pdf; https:\\/\\/espace.library.uq.edu.au\\/view\\/UQ:11316\",\"title\":\"Teaching Journalism in the Digital Age\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The information age - the product of the digital revolution - has massive implications for journalism and journalism education.

In addition, the take up of social networking technologies and innovative methods of digital publishing have encouraged educators to produce, distribute and share content and commentary. Grey literature may make a substantial contribution to education even though issues such as credibility, access and a lack of standards can pose problems for producers and users. This paper begins by providing a context for the discussion of grey literature within the broader policy and education environment in Australia. An overview of grey literature as it appears in education in Australia introducing evidence of its usage, dissemination and application in Australian education then follows. Evidence about the access, dissemination and use of grey literature is drawn from an examination of the characteristics of a leading social networking and digital publishing service that was used by educators in schools, training institutes and teacher education faculties. This evidence is discussed in the context of influential national, state and institutional policies that address the use of digital technologies in education. As the take up of digital technologies in education increases, there is an expectation that the access to, dissemination of and use of digital publishing by and for educators will increase and have an impact on online professional learning and awareness of education research and practices.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"Communication Technology and Digital Media Studies; Grey literature; Informal publishing; Digital publishing; EdNA; DERN\",\"subject\":\"Communication Technology and Digital Media Studies; Grey literature; Informal publishing; Digital publishing; EdNA; DERN\",\"authors\":\"White, G; Thomas, J; Weldon, P; Lawrence, A; Galatis, H; Tyndall, J\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/researchbank.rmit.edu.au\\/view\\/rmit:39672\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"6d0fdd7941ea5492ff3696f3a6ccbf4f481f6067b676e2ff7ee8934b98ac0d8d\",\"relevance\":71,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Decision support, Digital food education, Education revolution\",\"x\":\"0.0434836156117678\",\"y\":\"0.0164186839074221\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Decision support, Digital food education, Education revolution\"},{\"id\":\"6e5c33950da59b9c3a4a201b96967167dc1c32fe44ccf620f1bda313cf247c99\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/pure.au.dk\\/portal\\/da\\/publications\\/patterns-of-inclusion(97148134-d8c5-4d9d-8fd9-394586d09bef).html; https:\\/\\/pure.au.dk\\/ws\\/files\\/120071921\\/Pedersen_et_al_2018_Patterns_of_Inclusion.pdf\",\"title\":\"Patterns of inclusion:fostering digital citizenship through hybrid education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Reconsidering the concept of digital citizenship and the essential component of education the authors propose that the concept of Hybrid Education may serve both as a guideline for the utilization of digital technologies in education and as a methodology for fostering new forms of participation, inclusion and engagement in society.

The paper presents a theory-based, value driven and practical orientated framework for innovation in education. The paper documents a process where participants situated around the globe worked in collaboration with a group of participants gathered at a workshop on the concept of hybridity in education and on identifying and describing educational patterns for Hybrid Education that are directly applicable in relation to the concept of digital citizenship. The process introduces a value-based and vision-driven design pattern approach to innovation in education by framing and aligning values and visions of the participants.

Digital curation is gradually finding its way into higher education curricula aimed at fostering social media literacies. Teachers are urged to blend informal and formal learning and since most people informally use curation in their daily lives for compiling relevant information, it may be fairly easy to adopt digital curation in teaching and learning. Teachers, however, require considerable insight in incorporating various informal digital curation tools in educational practices. The SECTIONS model may assist in guiding decisions around the suitability of digital curation tools for a higher education environment. Including digital literacy training in the professional development of academic staff members may sensitize them to the possibilities that incorporating digital approaches in curricula offer. The Five Cs of Digital Curation framework may guide academic staff members in compiling suitable digital material.

Digital education is increasingly used for clinical practice guideline dissemination and adoption. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of digital education in improving the adoption of clinical practice guidelines. Methods We performed a systematic review and searched seven electronic databases from January 1990 to September 2018. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included studies in any language evaluating the effectiveness of digital education on clinical practice guidelines compared to other forms of education or no intervention in healthcare professionals. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of the body of evidence. Results Seventeen trials involving 2382 participants were included. The included studies were diverse with a largely unclear or high risk of bias. They mostly focused on physicians, evaluated computer-based interventions with limited interactivity and measured participants\\u2019 knowledge and behaviour. With regard to knowledge, studies comparing the effect of digital education with no intervention showed a moderate, statistically significant difference in favour of digital education intervention (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI 0.16, 1.54; I 2 = 83%, n = 3, moderate quality of evidence). Studies comparing the effect of digital education with traditional learning on knowledge showed a small, statistically non-significant difference in favour of digital education (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI \\u2212 0.12, 0.59; I 2 = 34%, n = 3, moderate quality of evidence). Three studies measured participants\\u2019 skills and reported mixed results. Of four studies measuring satisfaction, three studies favoured digital education over traditional learning. Of nine studies evaluating healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviour change, only one study comparing email-delivered, spaced education intervention to no intervention reported improvement in the intervention group. Of three studies reporting patient outcomes, only one study comparing email-delivered, spaced education games to non-interactive online resources reported modest improvement in the intervention group. The quality of evidence for outcomes other than knowledge was mostly judged as low due to risk of bias, imprecision and\\/or inconsistency. Conclusions Health professions digital education on clinical practice guidelines is at least as effective as traditional learning and more effective than no intervention in terms of knowledge. Most studies report little or no difference in healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviours and patient outcomes. The only intervention shown to improve healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviour and modestly patient outcomes was email-delivered, spaced education. Future research should evaluate interactive, simulation-based and spaced forms of digital education and report on outcomes such as skills, behaviour, patient outcomes and cost.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Medicine, Vol 17, Iss 1, Pp 1-16 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Clinical practice guidelines; Health professions education; Systematic review; Digital education; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"Clinical practice guidelines; Health professions education; Systematic review; Digital education; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Lorainne Tudor Car; Aijia Soong; Bhone Myint Kyaw; Kee Leng Chua; Naomi Low-Beer; Azeem Majeed\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12916-019-1370-1\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"78a502dba86c273a26dbdcffad138cd76409bb3d9eeb223409e1a6860b18e856\",\"relevance\":39,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital health education, Health education collaboration, Health professions digital\",\"x\":\"0.0165148692273407\",\"y\":\"-0.130672279566791\",\"area_uri\":8,\"area\":\"Digital health education, Health education collaboration, Health professions digital\"},{\"id\":\"7bfc7096443611ba6098c9924e3fc578d188dc9e763f34ed513bc76cd325cb48\",\"relation\":\"Early Childhood Education Journal\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10072\\/123797; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s10643-016-0792-z\",\"title\":\"A Conceptual Framework for Emergent Digital Literacy\",\"paper_abstract\":\"As we progress in the 21st century, children learn to become proficient readers and writers of both digital and non-digital texts. Knowledge, skills, and understandings of literacy emerge through sociocultural interactions with non-digital tools (e.g., paper-printed books) and digital tools (e.g., touch screen tablets). However, debate is ongoing over the role that digital experiences play in emergent literacy development. Researchers have voiced the need to conceptualise a common framework for literacy development that considers the emergence of digital literacy skills alongside conventional literacy skills and how these skills might interact during development. This is particularly important in light of the increasing use of digital texts used by young children, such as E-books and digital games. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that might guide research and practice by examining the relationships between emergent literacy skills, emergent digital literacy skills, and proficiency in reading and writing. ; Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Education and Professional Studies ; No Full Text\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education Systems not elsewhere classified\",\"subject\":\"Education Systems not elsewhere classified\",\"authors\":\"Neumann, Michelle; Finger, Glenn; Neumann, David\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10072\\/123797\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"7bfc7096443611ba6098c9924e3fc578d188dc9e763f34ed513bc76cd325cb48\",\"relevance\":24,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital fabrication, Design thinking, Construction management education\",\"x\":\"-0.323907586500791\",\"y\":\"-0.034115257305089\",\"area_uri\":10,\"area\":\"Digital fabrication, Design thinking, Construction management education\"},{\"id\":\"81225f5a547e221fda3f64f2aa1e1462bb091e3bb9e4517f873274ea8dfd5c94\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ro.ecu.edu.au\\/ajte\\/vol37\\/iss6\\/7; https:\\/\\/ro.ecu.edu.au\\/cgi\\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1836&context=ajte\",\"title\":\"Basic Literacy or New Literacies?

All paper is gradually converted to electronic format. One of the most significant innovations is the active implementation of digital education. The results of the comparative analysis have highlighted a number of major components of the digital education system. It has done the analysis of modern trends, which are today the main ones in the implementation of digital education in different educational institutions. The essence and basic qualities of distance and online learning are revealed. The role and main spectrum of tasks that automated testing in the control of knowledge and skills of education recipients is analyzed. A number of important areas are highlighted, which greatly increase the effectiveness of teaching and at the same time require a revision of traditional approaches to learning using mobile devices. Here are some of the key features of Learning Management Systems (LMS). The technology of adapting computer game techniques to non-game processes and events is discussed to increase the involvement of participants in the educational process. A number of benefits of digital education, combined with adaptive learning and personalization, have been highlighted, which are able to help each educator to achieve an optimal level of intellectual development according to his or her natural abilities and inclinations.

While we recognised the positive potential of the use of digital technology in higher education, we were cautious of an instrumentalist and disembodied understanding of (digital) technology and its potential impact on higher education \\u2013 as a sector of education and as a body of students. Aim: To re-conceptualise the way in which technology is understood for its use in the higher education sector, as is argued, would be of benefit for transformation in higher education. Setting: South African Higher Education sector. Methods: Phenomenology of embodiment. Results: An embodied understanding of technology through the embodied phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty and an explication of its potential for transformation in higher education via the working concept of the Embodied Screen leads to a full understanding of the student as embodied and socially-embedded individual. Conclusion: A more holistic and embodied understanding of digital technology serves to supplement transformation in higher education, especially if transformation is itself understood in concrete social and bodily terms as is the case in the South African context.\",\"published_in\":\"Transformation in Higher Education, Vol 3, Iss 0, Pp e1-e8 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital technology; technology; embodiment; higher education; transformation; merleau-Ponty; phenomenology; Education; L; Theory and practice of education; LB5-3640\",\"subject\":\"digital technology; technology; embodiment; higher education; transformation; merleau-Ponty; phenomenology; Education; L; Theory and practice of education; \",\"authors\":\"Jean du Toit; Ann\\u00e9 H.

Through exploratory sequential mixed research methods, we identify five HE outcomes and reveal that Learning-Oriented Outcomes are the most important in HE even when digital technologies are not used; and these outcomes are further enhanced when students use VLE. Learning-Oriented Outcomes, however, are the least important when SM is used in HE; students tend to prioritise outcomes related to Knowledge Transfer instead.

The article is devoted to the development of digital education. The gap between generations and social groups exacerbates the contradictions between the education system and the demands of the information society, and the increase in the volume, accessibility, speed of acquisition and exchange of knowledge has changed the style of knowledge of modern man. The key competence was the ability to distinguish important from unimportant, reliable from unreliable. Students need to purposefully develop digital identity. All this gives rise to a set of problems facing the modern school. The purpose of the study described in the article is to identify promising ways to digitalize the school, build a model of digital school and identify a set of factors that are important for the transformation of the school for all in the school for everyone. Methodology. In the course of the study, based on the analysis of existing approaches to the development of digital technologies and digitalization of education, the ways of formation and development of a digital school are revealed. The structure of the core of digital education providing comparability of the knowledge, values, skills and competences mastered and shown in various types of activity of the person is defined. This is the value, activity and content basis for the formation of digital socio-cultural educational environment. This core is proposed to be considered as a basis for the development of concepts of subject areas, GEF and educational programs at all levels of education. Results. The interpretation of the term \\u00abdigital education\\u00bb is given, which is understood as educational activity, the key factors of which are digital data, processing, exchange and analysis of which allow the individual to achieve new results of education in a specific sociocultural situation. According to the model, the digital school provides not only training and education, but also effective integration of the individual into a high-tech rapidly changing complex environment. The educational ecosystem is an integrative socio-cultural environment, in the center of which is not a teacher of a traditional school, but a student, surrounded by peers and adults who help him realize his personal educational trajectory. Conclusion. The article outlines the prerequisites for a new era-the era of digital education, formulated the definition of the term \\u00abdigital education\\u00bb, justified the relevance of the development and the structure of the core of digital education, describes the model of digital school, presents the structure of the educational ecosystem and the effects of its implementation for different stakeholders.\",\"published_in\":\"RUDN Journal of Informatization in Education, Vol 16, Iss 4, Pp 295-307 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital education; the core of digital education; digital school; educational ecosystem; Information technology; T58.5-58.64\",\"subject\":\"digital education; the core of digital education; digital school; educational ecosystem; Information technology;; 5-\",\"authors\":\"Alexander M.

In recent years, digital storytelling has become a modern way of telling stories, and in learning facilities it has been used as a reflec-tion medium. Vocational training often requires the dissemination of tacit and prac-tice-based knowledge, and the trainers of vocational teachers have been lacking an appropriate approach. The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate digital story-telling as an educational approach in vocational education. Data were obtained by participatory observation and included 19 digital storytellings, text analysis of 18 subject evaluations and text analysis of 19 reflection notes. Data from visual material (digital storytelling) and textual analyses were categorized, grouped and then dis-cussed and analyzed using phenomenological analysis. Our findings showed that digital storytelling as an educational approach, pro-mote learning outcomes through practical skills and increase the active use of subject terminology. The results showed further that digital storytelling promote reflection on one own and others\\u2019 actions and thus increase understanding of the actual work process in vocational education. Digital stories as an educational approach can increase didactic skills and hence digital skills while allowing participants to learn from each other\\u2019s challenges. ; publishedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"44-57 ; 8 ; Nordic Journal of Vocational Education and Training ; 1\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital historiefortelling; Digital Storytelling; Yrkespedagogikk; Vocational pedagogic; VDP::Andre pedagogiske fag: 289; VDP::Other subjects within education: 289\",\"subject\":\"Digital historiefortelling; Digital Storytelling; Yrkespedagogikk; Vocational pedagogic;\",\"authors\":\"Wolden, Anne-Catrine; Goth, Ursula Sm\\u00e5land; Larsen, Anne Karin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2496968\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"9e5bfd18066f42c7323e81ff930c8507f6ec753744238fd822581abcfa878f74\",\"relevance\":17,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital storytelling, Citizenship education, Distance education\",\"x\":\"-0.135479174585575\",\"y\":\"-0.063764935529478\",\"area_uri\":12,\"area\":\"Digital storytelling, Citizenship education, Distance education\"},{\"id\":\"a19d5a93aa66529ca3b0e8202b14a4abfd6ae95d78e30dc96ceb5d4d94900ffb\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/repo.uum.edu.my\\/26995\\/1\\/IJIDM%205%201%202019%2014%2017.pdf; Omar, Siti Nurhazzalilla and Abdul Salam, Sobihatun Nur and Abdul Rahim, Fauziah (2019) Validating a conceptual model of affective mediation digital training for training of trainers (TOT) in education through expert reviews.

In this paper, we raise the question of why Norwegian teacher education does not prepare student teachers to integrate digital tools into their teaching as required by the Norwegian curriculum. We question the formal premises governing the development of digital competence in teacher education and how they correspond with the requirements of the Norwegian national education curriculum. To gain insight into this question, we analysed how digital competence is presented in the official key documents that create the framework for teacher education, and compared them to the requirements of the Norwegian National Curriculum. Our findings indicate that there is a weak link between the curriculum and the premises for digital competence in teacher education.\",\"published_in\":\"Nordic Journal of Digital Literacy , Vol 10, Pp 69-83 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital competence; teacher education reform; national curriculum; Digitalcompetence; teachereducationreform; nationalcurriculum; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"Digital competence; teacher education reform; national curriculum; Digitalcompetence; teachereducationreform; nationalcurriculum; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"B\\u00e5rd Ketil Engen; Tonje Hilde Gi\\u00e6ver; Louise Mifsud\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/141634970a3547bba0b28dd852322600\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b42ae6b461e947d2237bb3222d2b3579dbb5d9c5f55dc6be18f1a73df9b1faf0\",\"relevance\":86,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital competence, Teacher education, Competencia digital\",\"x\":\"-0.0544791126732619\",\"y\":\"-0.0526726774209201\",\"area_uri\":11,\"area\":\"Digital competence, Teacher education, Competencia digital\"},{\"id\":\"b8ff69e220c1586823589235d440545cb162a20340a0d7531b9e2eeb90b0aa42\",\"relation\":\"INTED 2019; \\u0431\\u0435\\u0437 \\u043a\\u0432\\u0430\\u0440\\u0442\\u0438\\u043b\\u044f; Efimov, V.

In the future, several clusters of digital technology in the higher education will be deployed on the basis of data analytics, digital models, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and the blockchain. The study addresses the following objectives: 1) development of a structured \\u201cmap\\u201d of digital technology for higher education; 2) assessment of the extent of development and use of digital technologies in the higher education sphere at present (in developed countries and in a separate region of the Russian Federation \\u2013 Krasnoyarsk Krai); 3) assessment of the prospects for the development and adoption of digital technologies by 2035 (in developed countries and in Krasnoyarsk Krai). The following research methods were used: 1) a conceptual analysis of scientific publications, forecasts, foresight-studies and analytical reports; 2) expert interviews, 3) a questionnaire based survey (32 experts \\u2013 researchers, professors, representatives of government and consulting companies). The following core groups of digital technologies are designated: 1) digital solutions for defining the personal goals of education, educational navigation, building a project for an individual educational trajectory; 2) adaptive educational environment for the implementation of an individual educational trajectory; 3) digital solutions for learning activities support; monitoring the results of education; solutions for educational logistics; 4) digital solutions for assessment and certification (personal identification and competency assessment); 5) digital solutions for career support and lifelong education; 6) digital solutions for building and supporting university communities (including teachers, students, graduates, university partners); 7) digital solutions for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of competences at the population level. Each group includes 3\\u201312 technologies, so it is possible to build a detailed \\u201cmap\\u201d of digital technologies for higher education sphere. According to the experts, most of the major groups of digital technologies for education are currently (2018) in the stage of \\u201cworking prototypes and pilot products\\u201d and \\u201clocally used products\\u201d (in the developed countries of the world). The exceptions are \\u201cdigital solutions for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of competencies at the population level,\\u201d which are still at the \\u201cresearch and development\\u201d stage. By 2030, all technologies of major groups will reach the stage of \\u201cmass market products\\u201d and \\u201clocal market products\\u201d. The structure of assessments of the digital technology application in the present and prospects for adoption by 2030 for Krasnoyarsk Krai is generally similar to the structure of assessments for developed countries of the world, but the magnitudes of the estimates are much smaller. The result reflects the \\u201ccatching up\\u201d nature of the development of digital technology in the education sphere in the region. The basic strategy of digitalization of higher education in the region will be the transfer of ready-made solutions that have already found wide application in the developed countries of the world.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"higher education; digital technology; Krasnoyarsk Krai; 14.35\",\"subject\":\"higher education; digital technology; Krasnoyarsk Krai;; 35\",\"authors\":\"Efimov, V.; Lapteva, A.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/library.iated.org\\/view\\/EFIMOV2019DIG\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"b8ff69e220c1586823589235d440545cb162a20340a0d7531b9e2eeb90b0aa42\",\"relevance\":78,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital citizenship, Digital education revolution, Digital literacies\",\"x\":\"-0.0470646974622549\",\"y\":\"0.0248788741575761\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Digital citizenship, Digital education revolution, Digital literacies\"},{\"id\":\"bb576e893ebf482c38b37d03d9000ddc087189cb8f3fc19026765253c7837298\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/jsser.org\\/index.php\\/JSSER\\/article\\/view\\/173\\/pdf_2; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1309-9108; 1309-9108; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/0b1e363cd5fe4df28fc96c2fdbbc705c\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/0b1e363cd5fe4df28fc96c2fdbbc705c\",\"title\":\"The Effects of Activities for Digital Citizenship on Students\\u2019 Attitudes toward Digital Citizenship and Their Reflections on Students\\u2019 Understanding about Digital Citizenship\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Advances in info-communication technologies have brought many social, cultural, and economic changes along across the world. Recent reflections of these changes over citizenship studies are noteworthy. One of the relevant concepts, digital citizenship can be defined as applying and advocating behaviors necessary for legal, ethical, safe, and responsible use of info-communication technologies in online settings (ISTE, 2007). Day by day, individuals are becoming more and more digital citizens with the spread of the Internet and digital communication devices. However, this gives rise to discussions about problems related with ethics, privacy and security, health, communication, and etc. (Symantec, 2010; Deniz, 2010; Kadll, Kumba & Kanamad, 2010; Gunduz & Ozdinc, 2008; Kabakci & Can, 2009). All these hot issues, debates, and current technological competence standards point that teachers should teach this concept to their students as efficiently as possible by adopting digital citizenship (Greenhow, 2010). Ribble (2006) states that this education can be carried out through 9 dimensions such as digital ethics, digital communication, digital literacy, digital access, digital commerce, digital rights and law, digital privacy and security, digital responsibility, and digital health & wellness.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Social Studies Education Research, Vol 5, Iss 1, Pp 38-78 (2014)\",\"year\":\"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital citizenship; Social studies course; Citizenship education; Education (General); L7-991; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"Digital citizenship; Social studies course; Citizenship education;  Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"H\\u0131d\\u0131r KARADUMAN; Cemil Ozt\\u00fcrk\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/0b1e363cd5fe4df28fc96c2fdbbc705c\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"bb576e893ebf482c38b37d03d9000ddc087189cb8f3fc19026765253c7837298\",\"relevance\":85,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital citizenship, Digital education revolution, Digital literacies\",\"x\":\"-0.191777038006202\",\"y\":\"-0.00313774020065293\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Digital citizenship, Digital education revolution, Digital literacies\"},{\"id\":\"be32f480edd695f94e020790af806522fcb4a6345b9555f0e6bc9d06a2087750\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/repository.mkurwanda.ac.rw\\/handle\\/123456789\\/3858\",\"title\":\"Incorporating Digital Libraries Model in the Curriculum for Library and Information Science Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract ; This paper discusses the concept of digital libraries, embarking on why it is essential to adopt digitization in the present information intensive era.

Digital education is increasingly used in educating health professionals on diabetes. Digital diabetes self-management education for patients has been shown to improve patients\\u2019 knowledge and outcomes. However, the effectiveness of digital education on diabetes management for health care professionals is still unknown. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and economic impact of digital education in improving health care professionals\\u2019 knowledge, skills, attitudes, satisfaction, and competencies. We also assessed its impact on patient outcomes and health care professionals\\u2019 behavior. Methods: We included randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of digitalized diabetes management education for health care professionals pre- and postregistration. Publications from 1990 to 2017 were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, and Web of Science. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by 2 authors. Results: A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of digital education modality, comparators, outcome measures, and intervention duration. Most studies comparing digital or blended education to traditional education reported significantly higher knowledge and skills scores in the intervention group. There was little or no between-group difference in patient outcomes or economic impact. Most studies were judged at a high or unclear risk of bias. Conclusions: Digital education seems to be more effective than traditional education in improving diabetes management\\u2013related knowledge and skills. The paucity and low quality of the available evidence call for urgent and well-designed studies focusing on important outcomes such as health care professionals\\u2019 behavior, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness as well as its impact in diverse settings, including developing countries.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-02-21\",\"subject_orig\":\"R Medicine (General)\",\"subject\":\"digital health; diabetes management; education diabetes\",\"authors\":\"Huang, Z; Semwal, M; Lee, SY; Tee, M; Ong, W; Tan, WS; Bajpai, R; Tudor Car, L\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.keele.ac.uk\\/6022\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c58e5abcfac17cfe677e6c65b6dba0dd0432e2a2fef1225b1e5d400fd84bb76e\",\"relevance\":98,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital health education, Health education collaboration, Health professions digital\",\"x\":\"0.0147820932723598\",\"y\":\"-0.126735686519784\",\"area_uri\":8,\"area\":\"Digital health education, Health education collaboration, Health professions digital\"},{\"id\":\"c6b69ac297cf30757fa8d07e0f16fb8249353c2bbe3658ff0e2e8712ce7ced16\",\"relation\":\"Journal of Digital Learning in Teacher Education;4; 35; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2043\\/30605\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2043\\/30605\",\"title\":\"Teacher Educators' Use of Digital Tools and Needs for Digital Competence in Higher Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Based on a study at two Swedish universities, this article aimed to identify teacher educators\\u2019 use of digital tools and subsequent need for digital competence in higher education.

Existing definitions and perspectives in this area go beyond the use of technological tools or media for the creation of a digital literacy mindset, which develops throughout one\\u2019s life. However, Higher Education strategies have not yet caught up with this agenda. Design\\/methodology\\/approach: A student survey with Library and Information Science students from three higher education institutions in Scotland, Ireland and Greece was conducted as a basis of empirical data to support the theoretical propositions of the study. The survey centered on the technical and higher-level digital competences of students, and drawing from students\\u2019 self-perceived digital competences for learning and for the everyday life digital context, addressing e-leisure, e-learning, e-democracy, e-government, and e-health activities. The survey critically enabled students to assess digital competences from their perspectives as digital participants. Findings: Students\\u2019 self-assessment of digital competences were lacking in a number of areas, which involved the development of information literacy, digital creation, digital research and digital identity management. In addition, students\\u2019 digital competences were found to be linked to previous experiences within the everyday life digital environment. The higher the self-perceived digital competence levels of students were on the basis of dealing with everyday life digital tasks, the more likely they were to also develop high self-perceived digital competence in other digital areas related to their education. Originality\\/value: Higher education has not fully embraced digital competences as a core, fundamental literacy which addresses both technology mastery and a digital citizenship mindset. As emerging models begin to challenge traditional teaching and learning paradigms, with global connectivity and personalised approaches, existing digital divides may be further accelerated. This requires revisiting digital competences with emphasis on the diversity of the contexts where it develops and of the learners involved, in the overall continuum of learning for life.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-05-31\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital competences; Digital literacy; Information literacy; Everyday life; Higher education; Life-long-learning; Student transitions; Empirical research\",\"subject\":\"Digital competences; Digital literacy; Information literacy; Everyday life; Higher education; Life-long-learning; Student transitions; Empirical research\",\"authors\":\"Martzoukou, Konstantina.; Fulton, Crystal.; Kostagiolas, Petros.; Lavranos, Charilaos.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1108\\/JD-03-2020-0041\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c8ddd52b005a166df40cd04d898fd46e244ab49fc31b10391e8687c87570ec4c\",\"relevance\":63,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Higher education institutions, Digital inclusion, Higher education students\",\"x\":\"-0.17549938655211\",\"y\":\"0.00836304675696428\",\"area_uri\":5,\"area\":\"Higher education institutions, Digital inclusion, Higher education students\"},{\"id\":\"c9339b9b2bd3316fa1cb86cefb731efa11f799f252d4ffde89e5f29722a07556\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.idunn.no\\/dk\\/2018\\/03\\/teacher_educators_perceptions_of_workingwith_digital_tech; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0809-6724; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1891-943X; 0809-6724; 1891-943X; doi:10.18261\\/issn.1891-943x-2018-03-04; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/dda3ddc083184d4894e6e40d5907e12e\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.18261\\/issn.1891-943x-2018-03-04; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/dda3ddc083184d4894e6e40d5907e12e\",\"title\":\"Teacher educators\\u2019 perceptions of working with digital technologies\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract This article is part of a research project aimed to broaden the understanding of the established gap between policies regarding the use of digital technology and the actual use of digital technology in Norway.

In light of this, we propose an alternative approach to technology integration in professional education settings that aims to avoid unhelpful digital native stereotypes by instead developing digital literacies in ways that leverage technological affordances.

Norway implemented in 2006 a new national curriculum which increased the status of digital competence to be the fifth basic skill in the Norwegian elementary school (stage 1-13). This was a historic event and never before has digital competence achieved such status in curricula, neither nationally nor internationally. The same has newly happened with the new General Plan for Teacher Education where digital competence has become the fifth basic skill in all subjects. However, both teacher educators and teachers lack sufficient digital competence to fulfil these ambiguous policy goals and therefore the article suggest how a model of digital competence can bridge some of the gap between the intentions in the policy documents and the teachers\\/teacher educators\\u2019 practise. At the same time the article attempts to elaborate our perception of the concept digital competence in an educational discourse and how one can define digital competence in light of a Scandinavian educational perspective.

Face-to-face interactions with friends are being supplemented with digital communication. Australian children are particularly prolific users of the internet (Green et al, 2011). This online activity creates digital footprints. Digital footprint refers to the information and data that people generate, through purposive action or passive recording, when they go online (Thatcher, 2014). Digital footprints now play a role in people\\u2019s employment and educational opportunities (Black and Johnson, 2010). In this context not having a digital footprint can be as serious as having a badly managed one. One way to address this is for schools to explicitly teach students how to develop positive digital footprints that will help, rather than hinder, them in the future. Many schools have yet to respond to the challenge of helping students develop reputational management skills. Schools are caught between children\\u2019s and adolescents\\u2019 existing social and recreational uses of the internet and their responsibility to protect their students both on and off line (Luke et al., 2017). On the one hand, schools are tasked with giving students 21st century skills - the knowledge and practices required for participation and success in a technological world. On the other hand, concerns about digital footprints, bullying, privacy, safety and risk have led school systems to respond with prohibitions that attempt to govern students\\u2019 online exchanges (Selwyn, 2010). Given the emerging importance of digital footprints, expert insight can be utilised to provide guidance to teachers around this vexed issue. The \\u2018Best Footprint Forward\\u2019 project involved a survey of digital experts and career advisers to get their perspectives on digital footprint education in the Australian school context. This article reports on the following research questions: 1. what do experts know about digital footprint management ; and 2. what are their suggestions for education? Despite the increasing social and professional significance of digital footprints, expert perspectives on education for digital footprint management are not well known. We move now to detail the literature, reviewing what is known about children and adolescent internet usage, the professional implications of digital footprints, and digital footprints and the Australian curriculum. After providing an overview of the findings of the survey of experts, we conclude by describing the implications of this for schools, and for teachers\\u2019 practice.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"education; digital footprints; digital communication; digital culture; data\",\"subject\":\"education; digital footprints; digital communication; digital culture; data\",\"authors\":\"Buchanan, Rachel; Southgate, Erica; Scevak, Jill; Smith, Shamus P.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.13\\/1388393\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d84a2328b5d846d6bcf90a6d82fcbd4d7229d90f804b89fc9258549b09e8dfe9\",\"relevance\":80,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Higher education institutions, Digital inclusion, Higher education students\",\"x\":\"-0.241063185217508\",\"y\":\"-0.0170624770293216\",\"area_uri\":5,\"area\":\"Higher education institutions, Digital inclusion, Higher education students\"},{\"id\":\"d85ce2ed228c64ca882aff0fde97171af0c786b503236be5a811440467fa9df1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/un-pub.eu\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/wjet\\/article\\/view\\/4009; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1309-0348; doi:10.18844\\/wjet.v11i1.4009; 1309-0348; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b4dcdd60a76f4ddda8636ecb332d2bd1\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.18844\\/wjet.v11i1.4009; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b4dcdd60a76f4ddda8636ecb332d2bd1\",\"title\":\"An examination of digital footprint awareness and digital experiences of higher education students\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Rapid changes are occurring in life owing to information and communication technologies.

Much has been written about digital native students as a part of the Net generation or as Millennials. However, little work fully considers the impact of digital immigrant discourse within the fields of adult learning and continuing education. It is promising that rather than being digitally challenged immigrants for whom new learning technologies are completely foreign, adults of different ages can bring valuable knowledge and skills to e-learning environments that enable them to achieve academic success. These are important findings, since e-learning is increasingly recognized as an important part of learning across the life-course. With the growing body of research evidence countering common digital native and immigrant distinctions and critiquing an underlying technological determinism informing such arguments, how might practitioners respond to these discourses in their own educational contexts?

Exploring the possibilities of digital humanities for the history of education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"n the past few years, worries about decreasing jobs or even the possible disappearance of the history of education as a field of study have frequently surfaced. Hence, the question arises as to whether the history of education, as a field of study, has a future \\u2013 or is it, as many authors have remarked, in danger? This article starts from the idea that our field of study is definitely not alone in its struggle: many branches of the humanities have fallen victim to similar appeals of economic efficiency and relevance. In response to these developments, digital humanities in particular have been identified as a way out of the impasse. Therefore, this article explores the ways in which digital humanities or digital history can offer valuable contributions to the future of the history of education. This paper advocates that, although digital humanities or digital history cannot magically make our problems disappear, historians of education should further embrace the possibilities digital technology has to offer for the investigation of our educational past. I argue that digital technology not only has the potential to make our lives considerably easier; it can also help in addressing new research questions, give new meaning to existing concepts within the history of education and further enhance the interdisciplinary character of our discipline. ; status: published\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-09-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital history; technology; history of education\",\"subject\":\"digital history; technology; history of education\",\"authors\":\"Van Ruyskensvelde, Sarah\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/465817\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f17513123bfb3097e7071ecba4cb29767cd129d34fbd3507f1054526997bee83\",\"relevance\":69,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Digital citizenship, Digital education revolution, Digital literacies\",\"x\":\"-0.0275120322745796\",\"y\":\"0.0770778285080709\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Digital citizenship, Digital education revolution, Digital literacies\"},{\"id\":\"fd75cd435c9c661b0176f72250bf383889b8483448714270622a4a196974fb74\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/pure.au.dk\\/portal\\/da\\/publications\\/design-thinking-for-digital-fabrication-in-education(60fc8af9-7ef0-45d5-a2b6-b5a13287995f).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.ijcci.2015.10.002; http:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S2212868915000203\",\"title\":\"Design Thinking for Digital Fabrication in Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this paper, we argue that digital fabrication in education may benefit from design thinking, to foster a more profound understanding of digital fabrication processes among students.

Reviews of existing literature consistently lack sufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of digital interventions for health professions' education, which may reflect disconnections among learning theories, curriculum design, use of technology, and outcome evaluation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify, map, and evaluate the use of learning theories in designing and implementing intervention trials of health professions' digital education, as well as highlight areas for future research on technology-enhanced education via the establishment of a development framework for practice and research. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library), PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Education Resources Information Center, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2007 and 2016. RESULTS: A total of 874 RCTs on digital health education were identified and categorized into online-offline, mobile digital education, and simulation-based modalities for pre and postregistration health professions' education. Of these, 242 studies were randomly selected for methodological review and thematic analysis. Data were extracted by one author using a standardized form, with a (48\\/242, 20%) random sample extracted by a second author, in duplicate. One-third (81\\/242, 33.4%) of the studies reported single or multiple learning theories in design, assessment, conceptualization, or interpretation of outcomes of the digital education interventions. Commonly reported learning theories were problem-based learning (16\\/81, 20%), social learning theory (11\\/81, 14%), and cognitive theory of multimedia learning (10\\/81, 12%). Most of these studies assessed knowledge (118\\/242, 48.8%), skills (62\\/242, 25.6%), and performance (59\\/242, 24.3%) as primary outcomes with nonvalidated assessment tools (151\\/242, 62.4%). Studies with reported learning theories (\\u03c721=8.2; P=.002) and validated instruments (\\u03c721=12.6; P=.006) have shown effective acquisition of learning outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a Theory-Technology Alignment Framework to safeguard the robustness and integrity of the design and implementation of future digital education programs for the training of health professionals.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-03-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"L Education (General); R Medicine (General); R735 Medical education.
