However, it is unclear whether cell specific consequences are associated with cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated heart tissue utilizing in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA-sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19.In this study, 95 SARS-CoV-2-positive autopsy cases were included. A relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load in the cardiac tissue was detected in 41\\/95 deceased (43%). MACE-RNA-sequencing was performed to identify molecular pathomechanisms caused by the infection of the heart. A signature matrix was generated based on the single-cell dataset \\\"Heart Cell Atlas\\\" and used for digital cytometry on the MACE-RNA-sequencing data. Thus, immune cell fractions were estimated and revealed no difference in immune cell numbers in cases with and without cardiac infection. This result was confirmed by quantitative immunohistological diagnosis.MACE-RNA-sequencing revealed 19 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a q-value <0.05 (e.g. up: IFI44L, IFT3, TRIM25; down: NPPB, MB, MYPN). The upregulated DEGs were linked to interferon pathways and originate predominantly from endothelial cells. In contrast, the downregulated DEGs originate predominately from cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescent staining showed viral protein in cells positive for the endothelial marker ICAM1 but rarely in cardiomyocytes. The GO term analysis revealed that downregulated GO terms were linked to cardiomyocyte structure, whereas upregulated GO terms were linked to anti-virus immune response.This study reveals, that cardiac infection induced transcriptomic alterations mainly linked to immune response and destruction of cardiomyocytes. While endothelial cells are primarily targeted by the virus, we suggest cardiomyocyte-destruction by paracrine effects. Increased pro-inflammatory gene expression was detected in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiac tissue but no increased SARS-CoV-2 associated immune cell infiltration was observed.Cardiac injury can be documented in COVID-19, regardless the direct cardiac virus infection and is known to be associated with outcome.

Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is associated with adverse outcome. However, it is unclear whether cell specific consequences are associated with cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated heart tissue utilizing in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA-sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19.In this study, 95 SARS-CoV-2-positive autopsy cases were included. A relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load in the cardiac tissue was detected in 41\\/95 deceased (43%). MACE-RNA-sequencing was performed to identify molecular pathomechanisms caused by the infection of the heart. A signature matrix was generated based on the single-cell dataset \\\"Heart Cell Atlas\\\" and used for digital cytometry on the MACE-RNA-sequencing data. Thus, immune cell fractions were estimated and revealed no difference in immune cell numbers in cases with and without cardiac infection. This result was confirmed by quantitative immunohistological diagnosis.MACE-RNA-sequencing revealed 19 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a q-value <0.05 (e.g. up: IFI44L, IFT3, TRIM25; down: NPPB, MB, MYPN). The upregulated DEGs were linked to interferon pathways and originate predominantly from endothelial cells. In contrast, the downregulated DEGs originate predominately from cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescent staining showed viral protein in cells positive for the endothelial marker ICAM1 but rarely in cardiomyocytes. The GO term analysis revealed that downregulated GO terms were linked to cardiomyocyte structure, whereas upregulated GO terms were linked to anti-virus immune response.This study reveals, that cardiac infection induced transcriptomic alterations mainly linked to immune response and destruction of cardiomyocytes. While endothelial cells are primarily targeted by the virus, we suggest cardiomyocyte-destruction by paracrine effects. Increased pro-inflammatory gene expression was detected in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiac tissue but no increased SARS-CoV-2 associated immune cell infiltration was observed.Cardiac injury can be documented in COVID-19, regardless the direct cardiac virus infection and is known to be associated with outcome. However, the direct virus infection of the myocardium leads to transcriptomic alterations and might therefore additionally contribute to pathophysiological processes in COVID-19. Therefore, consequences of cardiac virus infection need to be investigated in future studies, since they might also contribute to long-term effects in case of survival.\\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has dramatically changed teaching approach in dental schools due to the switch to distance learning and the lack of practice training in direct contact with patients with possible impact on clinical skills of students. The aim of the study was to assess the level of the 2020 final year dental students' self-confidence in performing different dental procedures through specially designed questionnaire and compare it to self-confidence of the 2019 final year students.An anonymous questionnaire consisting of 40 questions regarding self-confidence level in performing 40 different dental procedures and based on five points Likert-like scale was distributed during November 2020 to final year dental students whose studies were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in one semester.

These findings highlight opportunities for funding and professional development of public health systems, both during and after the COVID-19 response, to help ensure the continuity of essential public health services, staffing sustainability, and preparedness for future public health emergencies in the U.S. Kintziger, Kristina W;Stone, Kahler W;Jagger, Meredith A;Horney, Jennifer A  PloS one\",\"doi\":\"10.1371\\/journal.pone.0255844\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"readers\":\"0\",\"pmcid\":\"\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Public health, Digital health, Gender-based violence\",\"x\":\"0.233945588077539\",\"y\":\"0.14808303363991\",\"area_uri\":6,\"area\":\"Public health, Digital health, Gender-based violence\"},{\"id\":\"34648525\",\"title\":\"Risk factors for increased COVID-19 case-fatality in the United States: A county-level analysis during the first wave.\",\"pmid\":\"34648525\",\"published_in\":\"PloS one\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant morbidity and mortality across the US.

The prevalence of anxiety, stress and depression among the sample population were 28.6%, 18.11% and 15% respectively. The prevalence of burnout was 12.3%. This was in parallel with several changes in the lives of the healthcare professionals, including; working longer hours, spending time in isolation and being separated from family.This study indicates that the mental health of a significant portion of the nation's workforce is compromised and, therefore, highlights the need for an urgent intervention particularly since many countries, including Cyprus, are suffering a second wave of the pandemic. The identified risk factors should offer guidance for employers aiming to protect their frontline healthcare workers from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Further, we have experimentally characterized the residue 91-112 by using reductionist approaches. CD spectroscopy suggests that the NSP6 (91-112) is disordered-like region in isolation, which gains helical conformation in different biological mimic environmental conditions. These studies can be helpful to study NSP6 (91-112) interactions with host proteins, where different protein conformations might play a significant role. The present study adds up more information about the NSP6 protein aspect, which could be exploited for its host protein interaction and pathogenesis.Copyright \\u00a9 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Psychological, sociodemographic and obstetric factors and the new PREPS were collected.Bartlett's test of sphericity (\\u03c72(105)\\u00a0=\\u00a0580.36, p < .001), and KMO\\u00a0=\\u00a0.79 confirmed appropriateness for factor analysis of the PREPS. Confirmatory factor analyses based on the factor structure of the original USA English version of this instrument confirmed three factors - Preparedness Stress (7 items), Perinatal Infection Stress (5 items), and Positive Appraisal (3 items). The 15-item version of the PREPS demonstrates internal consistency and reliability are adequate (\\u03b1 > .77), and for F1 - Preparedness (\\u03b1 > .65), for F2 - Infection (\\u03b1 > 0.60) and for F3 - Positive appraisal (\\u03b1 > .55). The three factors exhibited good inter-item correlations, (F1 - Preparedness: .21; F2 - Infection: .23, and F3 - Positive Appraisal: .29). Convergent validity was examined through the Pearson's correlation coefficients of the PREPS with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (PDQ). Correlation between PREPS total and PSS was high, and moderate with PDQ (p < .05).The psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the PREPS make it a valuable psychological measure to assess pandemic-related stress among pregnant women.Copyright \\u00a9 2021.

In addition to respiratory insufficiency, COVID-19 causes multi-organ failure and multiple metabolic derangements, which can cause AMS, and the multi-system involvement could account for the prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality.

In this study, we aim to investigate the impacts of lockdown measures on both ambient and household air pollution as well as the short-term health effects of air pollution changes.In this study, an up-to-date emission inventory from January to March 2020 in China was developed based on air quality observations in combination with emission-concentration response functions derived from chemical transport modeling. These emission inventories, together with the emissions data from 2017 to 2019, were fed into the state-of-the-art regional chemistry transport model to simulate the air quality in the North China Plain. A hypothetical scenario assuming no lockdown effects in 2020 was also performed to determine the effects of the lockdown on air quality in 2020. A difference-to-difference approach was adopted to isolate the effects on air quality due to meteorological conditions and long-term decreasing emission trends by comparing the PM2.5 changes during lockdown to those before lockdown in 2020 and in previous years (2017-2019). The short-term premature mortality changes from both ambient and household PM2.5 changes were quantified based on two recent epidemiological studies, with uncertainty of urban and rural population migration considerations.The national lockdown measures during COVID-19 led to a reduction of 5.1\\u00a0\\u00b5g\\u00a0m-3 in ambient PM2.5 across the North China Plain (NCP) from January 25th to March 5th compared with the hypothetical simulation with no lockdown measures.

Researchers from all over the world developed some drugs which failed to completely suppress the contiguous disease. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), an important component in viral pathogenesis, is considered as a prospective drug target to stop SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since identification of phytochemicals with anti-Mpro activity has been carried out to develop the potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present study was conducted to screen phytochemicals of Berberis asiatica for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Through text mining, thirty phytochemicals were reported from B.\\u00a0asiatica, of which, three phytochemicals (Berbamine, Oxyacanthine, and Rutin) show high affinity with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and exhibited favorable intermolecular interactions with the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) and other essential residues. The molecular dynamics simulation showed that Mpro-phytochemical complexes are more stable, less fluctuating, more compact, and moderately extended than the Mpro-X77 (Reference) complex. The number of H-bonds and MMPBSA results also demonstrates that Berbamine, Oxyacanthine, and Rutin are potent Mpro inhibitors having free energy of\\u00a0-20.79,\\u00a0-33.35, and\\u00a0-31.12\\u202fkcal\\u202fmol-1 respectively. The toxicity risk prediction supports all phytochemicals for drug-like and non-toxic nature. From the result, we propose that binding of these phytochemicals could hamper the function of Mpro.

Owing to the shortage of specific medicines, the global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been the greatest challenge for the science community. Researchers from all over the world developed some drugs which failed to completely suppress the contiguous disease. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), an important component in viral pathogenesis, is considered as a prospective drug target to stop SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since identification of phytochemicals with anti-Mpro activity has been carried out to develop the potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present study was conducted to screen phytochemicals of Berberis asiatica for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Through text mining, thirty phytochemicals were reported from B.\\u00a0asiatica, of which, three phytochemicals (Berbamine, Oxyacanthine, and Rutin) show high affinity with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and exhibited favorable intermolecular interactions with the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) and other essential residues. The molecular dynamics simulation showed that Mpro-phytochemical complexes are more stable, less fluctuating, more compact, and moderately extended than the Mpro-X77 (Reference) complex. The number of H-bonds and MMPBSA results also demonstrates that Berbamine, Oxyacanthine, and Rutin are potent Mpro inhibitors having free energy of\\u00a0-20.79,\\u00a0-33.35, and\\u00a0-31.12\\u202fkcal\\u202fmol-1 respectively. The toxicity risk prediction supports all phytochemicals for drug-like and non-toxic nature. From the result, we propose that binding of these phytochemicals could hamper the function of Mpro.
