Managing the pathways through which alien species arrive and spread is important to reduce the threat of biological invasions. Harmonising information on pathways across individual sectors and user groups is therefore critical to underpin policy and action. The European Alien Species Information Network (EASIN) has been developed to easily facilitate open access to data of alien species in Europe. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Pathway Classification framework has become a global standard for the classification of pathways. We followed a structured approach to assign pathway information within EASIN for a subset of alien species in Europe, which covered 4169 species, spanning taxonomic groups and environments. We document constraints and challenges associated with implementing the CBD Pathway Classification framework and propose potential amendments to increase clarity. This study is unique in the scope of taxonomic coverage and also in the inclusion of primary (independent introductions to Europe) and secondary (means of dispersal for species expansion within Europe, after their initial introduction) modes of introduction. In addition, we summarise the patterns of introduction pathways within this subset of alien species within the context of Europe. Based on the analyses, we confirm that the CBD Pathway Classification framework offers a robust, hierarchical system suitable for the classification of alien species introduction and spread across a wide range of taxonomic groups and environments. However, simple modifications could improve interpretation of the pathway categories ensuring consistent application across databases and information systems at local, national, regional, continental and global scales. Improving consistency would also help in the development of pathway action plans, as required by EU legislation.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-10-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion pathway; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; aquatic science; invasive species; introduced species; biodiversity; invasion pathway\",\"subject\":\"aquatic science; invasive species; introduced species; biodiversity; invasion pathway\",\"authors\":\"Pergl, Jan; Brundu, Giuseppe; Harrower, Colin A.; Cardoso, Ana C.; Genovesi, Piero; Katsanevakis, Stelios; Lozano, Vanessa; Perglov\\u00e1, Irena; Rabitsch, Wolfgang; Richards, Gareth; Roques, Alain; Rorke, Stephanie L.; Scalera, Ricardo; Sch\\u00f6nrogge, Karsten; Stewart, Alan; Tricarico, Elena; Tsiamis, Konstatinos; Vannini, Andrea; Vil\\u00e0, Montserrat; Zenetos, Argyro; Roy, Helen E.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q107468705\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"01adc4e9418f7117a431c85c71458e05b17cd527f6d3dd22086ef81ba69af841\",\"relevance\":92,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Pergl, Jan; Brundu, Giuseppe; Harrower, Colin A.; Cardoso, Ana C.; Genovesi, Piero; Katsanevakis, Stelios; Lozano, Vanessa; Perglov\\u00e1, Irena; Rabitsch, Wolfgang; Richards, Gareth; Roques, Alain; Rorke, Stephanie L.; Scalera, Ricardo; Sch\\u00f6nrogge, Karsten; Roy, Helen E.\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion pathway\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion pathway\",\"x\":\"5.2737201841339e-27\",\"y\":\"3.61764695076284e-27\",\"labels\":\"01adc4e9418f7117a431c85c71458e05b17cd527f6d3dd22086ef81ba69af841\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Invasion pathway\"},{\"id\":\"05a284b514d511a5cb6ff305de0cc608869e81ce24f269e4c261977ebc7675b1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34031570; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q34031570; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC3174229; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0024890\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34031570; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q34031570; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC3174229; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0024890\",\"title\":\"Alien plants introduced by different pathways differ in invasion success: unintentional introductions as a threat to natural areas\",\"paper_abstract\":\"BackgroundUnderstanding the dimensions of pathways of introduction of alien plants is important for regulating species invasions, but how particular pathways differ in terms of post-invasion success of species they deliver has never been rigorously tested. We asked whether invasion status, distribution and habitat range of 1,007 alien plant species introduced after 1500 A.D. to the Czech Republic differ among four basic pathways of introduction recognized for plants.Principal findingsPathways introducing alien species deliberately as commodities (direct release into the wild; escape from cultivation) result in easier naturalization and invasion than pathways of unintentional introduction (contaminant of a commodity; stowaway arriving without association with it). The proportion of naturalized and invasive species among all introductions delivered by a particular pathway decreases with a decreasing level of direct assistance from humans associated with that pathway, from release and escape to contaminant and stowaway. However, those species that are introduced via unintentional pathways and become invasive are as widely distributed as deliberately introduced species, and those introduced as contaminants invade an even wider range of seminatural habitats.ConclusionsPathways associated with deliberate species introductions with commodities and pathways whereby species are unintentionally introduced are contrasting modes of introductions in terms of invasion success. However, various measures of the outcome of the invasion process, in terms of species' invasion success, need to be considered to accurately evaluate the role of and threat imposed by individual pathways. By employing various measures we show that invasions by unintentionally introduced plant species need to be considered by management as seriously as those introduced by horticulture, because they invade a wide range of seminatural habitats, hence representing even a greater threat to natural areas.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2011-09-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; theme:invasion pathway; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; invasion biology; invasion success; invasion pathway\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; invasion success; invasion pathway\",\"authors\":\"Py\\u0161ek, Petr; Jaro\\u0161\\u00edk, Vojt\\u011bch; Pergl, Jan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34031570\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"05a284b514d511a5cb6ff305de0cc608869e81ce24f269e4c261977ebc7675b1\",\"relevance\":88,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Py\\u0161ek, Petr; Jaro\\u0161\\u00edk, Vojt\\u011bch; Pergl, Jan\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55329443831064e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55088706669712e-27\",\"labels\":\"05a284b514d511a5cb6ff305de0cc608869e81ce24f269e4c261977ebc7675b1\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"0825a27c5cb39826a7ab2868d181c4f96bde48c6f085b4cf9d8c12dfdef09006\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35969107; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35969107; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4807039; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0152070\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35969107; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35969107; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4807039; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0152070\",\"title\":\"Making a Bad Situation Worse: An Invasive Species Altering the Balance of Interactions between Local Species\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Biological invasions pose a significant threat to biodiversity, especially on oceanic islands. One of the primary explanations for the success of plant invaders is direct suppression of competitors. However, indirect interactions can also be important, although they are often overlooked in studies on biological invasion. The shrub Leucaena leucocephala is a widespread island invader with putative allelopathic effects on the germination and growth of other species. We quantified the impact of Leucaena on plant communities richness on an oceanic Brazilian island and, through nursery experiments, investigated the potential for allelopathic effects on the germination of Erythrina velutina, a native species that is often absent from stands of Leucaena. Additionally, in a manipulative field experiment, we examined the direct and indirect effects (mediated by the native species Capparis flexuosa) of the invader on the development of Erythrina. The species richness in invaded sites was lower than in uninvaded sites, and Capparis was the only native species that was frequently present in invaded sites. In the nursery experiments, we found no evidence that Leucaena affects the germination of Erythrina. In the field experiments, the odds of Erythrina germination were lower in the presence of Leucaena litter, but higher in the presence of Leucaena trees. However, the survival and growth of Erythrina were considerably inhibited by the presence of Leucaena trees. The isolated effect of native Capparis on the germination and growth of Erythrina varied from positive to neutral. However, when Capparis and Leucaena were both present, their combined negative effects on Erythrina were worse than the effect of Leucaena alone, which may be attributed to indirect effects. This study provides the first empirical evidence that the balance of the interactions between native species can shift from neutral\\/positive to negative in the presence of an exotic species.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-03-24\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasion biology; invasive species; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; invasive species; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Mello, Thayn\\u00e1 Jeremias; Oliveira, Alexandre A.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35969107\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"0825a27c5cb39826a7ab2868d181c4f96bde48c6f085b4cf9d8c12dfdef09006\",\"relevance\":62,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Mello, Thayn\\u00e1 Jeremias; Oliveira, Alexandre A.\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12721746957917e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37654988214233e-27\",\"labels\":\"0825a27c5cb39826a7ab2868d181c4f96bde48c6f085b4cf9d8c12dfdef09006\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"0828c7d4491a11bac75210fc71e73382ecb150551903e7ad92663780a0ddafad\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111158311; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q111158311; doi:10.1007\\/S00265-021-02984-8\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111158311; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q111158311; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/S00265-021-02984-8\",\"title\":\"The impact of turbidity on foraging and risk taking in the invasive Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and a threatened native cichlid (Oreochromis amphimelas)\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Anthropogenic activity can increase water turbidity, changing fish behaviour by reducing visibility. The spread of invasive species is also facilitated by human activity, further increasing the pressure on native species. In two experiments, we measured the foraging efficiency, risk perception and inter-individual consistency of risk-taking (personality variation in boldness) of an invasive species, the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and a threatened tilapia, the Manyara tilapia (Oreochromis amphimelas), in clear and turbid water. In experiment one, O. niloticus was faster to initiate feeding, encountered more food items and consumed more than O. amphimelas. The latency to start foraging by O. niloticus decreased in turbid water. Turbidity did not affect the latency to start foraging in O. amphimelas but the number of food items they encountered was highest at the intermediate turbidity. There was however no significant effect of turbidity in either species on the total food consumed. In contrast to this foraging context, in experiment two with a refuge and no food available, risk taking behaviour was similar in both species and they both responded with similarly reduced risk taking in turbid water. Evidence of personality variation was weak, being observed only in O. amphimelas when first leaving the shelter in turbid water. Overall, species differences were greater in the foraging context but turbidity was more important in the risk-taking context. O. amphimelas is more sensitive to turbidity during foraging, and O. niloticus is likely to have a competitive advantage in foraging situations, especially in degraded turbid habitats. Significance statement Under human-induced environmental change, native species are often exposed to multiple stressors.

For each species information is given on (ii) invasion status (casual, naturalized or invasive), biogeography, habitat and life-form characteristics, and pathways of introduction. Further, we (iii) explain the differences in the alien species composition in different parts of the country, and (iv) analyse the drivers of plant invasions in Oman. Out of the 111 alien species reported (7.7% of the total Oman vascular flora), 34 species are casuals and 77 naturalized; of the latter seven are considered invasive. The moderate number of alien plant species is likely a result of the country\\u2019s arid climate, with extremely high summer temperatures and low annual precipitation in most of its area, and the relatively long isolation of the country. The families richest in alien plant species are Fabaceae (17 species), Asteraceae (14 species) and Poaceae (12 species).

The number, frequency and geographic origin of pathways for the arrival and dispersal of alien species to and within Gal\\u00e1pagos have increased over time, tracking closely the increase in human population (residents and tourists) on the islands.

The impact of invasive plant species needs to be quantified using comparable assessment tools across different habitats and species to allocate limited resources to high-priority species. Here, we used the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS) to assess the impacts of 16 fleshy-fruited alien invasive plant species in South Africa generally dispersed by native avian species. The results showed that fleshy-fruited invasive species have both environmental and socio-economic impacts. The cumulated impact scores for lantana (Lantana camara) and the tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) were the highest, with scores of 42 and 32, respectively. Some species, such as white mulberry (Morus alba), camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora), American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) and Brazilian pepper tree (Schinus terebinthifolius), had low overall impact scores of 8, 18, 14 and 16, respectively, but scored the maximum impact of 5 for certain mechanisms. Environmental impacts of fleshy-fruited invasive plant species had a high impact magnitude through effects on the ecosystem and vegetation. Socio-economic impacts were mainly through effects on forest production, agriculture and human health. Species with large crop sizes, small seeds and fruit sizes had higher environmental and socio-economic impact magnitude. The information generated in this study is important for guiding resource allocation and preventing the uncontrolled introduction of invasive species in South Africa. The impact of the fleshy-fruited invasive species transcended sectors and, therefore, effective management of invasive species will require the collaboration of multiple and inter-sectoral stakeholders in South Africa.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2022-07-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasion impact; invasive plant\",\"subject\":\"invasion impact; invasive plant\",\"authors\":\"Bitani, Nasiphi; Shivambu, Tinyiko C.; Shivambu, Ndivhuwo; Downs, Colleen T.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q113692791\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"0fb1b79a26dc4c5b3ee523c2fdaa2194883dec020ab46721cd7c70232e2f3532\",\"relevance\":110,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"unknown\",\"dclanguage\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Bitani, Nasiphi; Shivambu, Tinyiko C.; Shivambu, Ndivhuwo; Downs, Colleen T.\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12724302911815e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37650001873559e-27\",\"labels\":\"0fb1b79a26dc4c5b3ee523c2fdaa2194883dec020ab46721cd7c70232e2f3532\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"11e2ead6d0343314d7d3aca4ba2ff76ad00619260d819d74dd84cd5d702fa9a3\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q28597829; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q28597829; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4985174; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0161130\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q28597829; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q28597829; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4985174; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0161130\",\"title\":\"Molluscs for Sale: Assessment of Freshwater Gastropods and Bivalves in the Ornamental Pet Trade\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The ornamental pet trade is often considered a key culprit for conservation problems such as the introduction of invasive species (including infectious diseases) and overharvesting of rare species. Here, we present the first assessment of the biodiversity of freshwater molluscs in the ornamental pet trade in Singapore, one of the most important global hubs of the ornamental aquarium trade, and discuss associated conservation concerns. We recorded freshwater molluscs from ornamental pet shops and major exporters including non-ornamental species (e.g., hitchhikers, molluscs sold as fish feed). We recorded an unexpectedly high diversity-59 species-of freshwater bivalves and gastropods, with the majority (38 species or 64%) being from the Oriental region. In addition to morphological examination, we sequenced the DNA barcode region of mitochondrial CO1 and 16S genes to provide molecular data for the confirmation of the identification and for future re-identification. DNA barcodes were obtained for 50 species, and all but four were separated by > 3% uncorrected pairwise distances. The trade has been considered a main introduction pathway for non-native species to Singapore, and we found that out of 15 species in the trade as well as in the wild in Singapore, 12 are either introduced or of unknown origin, representing almost half of the known non-native freshwater molluscs in Singapore. Particularly prevalent are non-ornamental species: six hitchhikers on aquarium plants and six species sold as fish feed. We found that a quarter of the trade species have a history of introduction, which includes 11 known or potentially invasive species. We conclude that potential overharvesting is difficult to assess because only half of the trade species have been treated by IUCN. Of these, 21 species are of Least Concern and three are Data Deficient.

This study compares the growth performance of the invasive blackberry (Rubus niveusThunb.) with four of the most common woody native species of the Scalesia forest in the Galapagos Islands. Using a series of greenhouse and field studies, the growth rate and biomass production of native species alone and in competition withR. niveuswas compared under different water and light stress conditions.Rubus niveusshowed a faster growth rate and biomass production than the native species as well as a broad tolerance to light and water stress conditions. Competitive ability was also assessed by looking at the seedbank and regeneration processes after herbicide control in the field. Although the number ofR. niveusseedlings that germinated from the soil samples was considerably larger than that of native species, recruitment of the invasive on the experimental plots was limited. Overall,R. niveusshowed superior competitive ability over native species with comparable growth forms, suggesting a possible mechanism that enablesR. niveusto successfully invade a wide range of habitats in the Galapagos Islands.

The results showed that the combination of data from the native and the invaded areas was the most effective methodology for the appropriate invasive species modeling. The species was not influenced by overall landscape factors, but only by the presence of its host plant, dispersal capacity, and climate suitability. Such climate suitability was described by low precipitation seasonality and minimum annual temperatures around 0\\u00b0C, defining a continentality effect throughout the territory. We emphasize the need of studying distribution and severe defoliation processes separately because we identified that climate suitability was slightly involved in limiting species spread processes but strongly constrained ecosystem impact in terms of defoliation before the species reaches equilibrium with the new environment.

We investigated the diversity of native species to understand the impact of exotic Oreochromis niloticus in the upper Kabompo River, northwest of Zambia using taxonomic and functional diversity indices. To achieve this, two tests were performed (Test 1, compared natives in invaded and uninvaded sections; Test 2, compared natives in invaded section). A total of 17 species were collected for functional diversity computation, out of which fourteen (14) functional trait measurements linked to feeding, locomotion, and life history strategy were taken. Findings revealed that taxonomic and functional diversity values changed with invasion in both tests. Taxonomic diversity was 15% more in invaded than uninvaded sections in Test 1 and was not consistent across sampling points of invaded section in Test 2. Invaded areas were taxonomically less diverse, but functionally diverse in both tests. The analysis of similarity and nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed no difference in Bray-Curtis similarity assemblages in both tests.

While many social insect species and in particular ant species have been introduced outside their native ranges, few species have been successful at invading temperate forests. In this study, we document for the first time the relationship between the abundance of the introduced ant, Pachycondyla chinensis, in mature forests of North Carolina and the composition, abundance and diversity of native ant species using both a matched pair approach and generalized linear models. Where present, P. chinensis was more abundant than all native species combined. The diversity and abundance of native ants in general and many individual species were negatively associated with the presence and abundance of P. chinensis. These patterns held regardless of our statistical approach and across spatial scales. Interestingly, while the majority of ant species was strongly and negatively correlated with the abundance and presence of P. chinensis, a small subset of ant species larger than P. chinensis was either as abundant or even more abundant in invaded than in uninvaded sites. The large geographic range of this ant species combined with its apparent impact on native species make it likely to have cascading consequences on eastern forests in years to come, effects mediated by the specifics of its life history which is very different from those of other invasive ants.

I argue that the abundance-impact curve is determined jointly by a non-native species and the ecosystem it invades, so that a species may have multiple abundance-impact curves. Models of the impacts of the invasive mussel Dreissena show how a single species can have multiple, noninterchangeable abundance-impact curves. To the extent that ecosystem characteristics determine the abundance-impact curve, abundance-impact curves based on horizontal designs (space-for-time substitution) may be misleading and should be used with great caution, it at all. It is important for scientists and managers to correctly specify the abundance-impact curve when considering the impacts of non-native species.

We argue that explicitly defining the impact of non-native species will promote progress toward a better understanding of the implications of changes to biodiversity and ecosystems caused by non-native species; help disentangle which aspects of scientific debates about non-native species are due to disparate definitions and which represent true scientific discord; and improve communication between scientists from different research disciplines and between scientists, managers, and policy makers. For these reasons and based on examples from the literature, we devised seven key questions that fall into 4 categories: directionality, classification and measurement, ecological or socio-economic changes, and scale.

Mutualistic plant\\u2013animal networks can be approached through complex network analysis; these networks are characterized by a nested structure consisting of a core of generalist species, which endows the network with stability and robustness against disturbance. Those mutualistic network structures can vary as a consequence of seasonal fluctuations and food availability, as well as the arrival of new species into the system that might disorder the mutualistic network structure (e.g., a decrease in nested pattern). However, there is no assessment on how the arrival of migratory species into seasonal tropical systems can modify such patterns. Emergent and fine structural temporal patterns are adressed here for the first time for plant-frugivorous bird networks in a highly seasonal tropical environment.Methods.In a plant-frugivorous bird community, we analyzed the temporal turnover of bird species comprising the network core and periphery of ten temporal interaction networks resulting from different bird migration periods. Additionally, we evaluated how fruit abundance and richness, as well as the arrival of migratory birds into the system, explained the temporal changes in network parameters such as network size, connectance, nestedness, specialization, interaction strength asymmetry and niche overlap. The analysis included data from 10 quantitative plant-frugivorous bird networks registered from November 2013 to November 2014.Results.We registered a total of 319 interactions between 42 plant species and 44 frugivorous bird species; only ten bird species were part of the network core.

The Mediterranean Sea, one of the major biodiversity hotspots in the world, has long suffered multiple and frequent invasion events. This paper represents the screening results of the potential invasiveness of 23 introduced marine fish species, which are classified as neonative and alien. To predict the invasiveness potential of species under current and predicted climate conditions, the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK) is applied. Thresholds have been constituted to classify low, medium and high-risk species by receiver operative characteristic curve analysis (ROC). The calibrated basic and climate-change threshold assessment scores used to classify species from low, to medium to high risk were computed between 27.5 and 33.0 respectively.

Associated conservation issues mapped were: climate sensitivity measured via ordination and non-linear modelling; habitat fragmentation represented by the proportion of remnant vegetation within a moving window; fire prone landscapes assessed using fire history records; invasive species assessed through diversity metrics, species distribution and literature. Compared to plots, herbarium data had higher spatial and taxonomic coverage but records were more biased towards major transport corridors. Beta diversity was influenced by sampling intensity and scale of comparison.

Globally, the taxonomy of non-native Prosopis species is problematic due to misidentification and extensive hybridization. We performed a genetic analysis on several Prosopis species, and their putative hybrids, including both native and non-native populations, with a special focus on Prosopis invasions in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania). We aimed to clarify the taxonomic placement of non-native populations and to infer the introduction histories of Prosopis in Eastern Africa. DNA sequencing data from nuclear and chloroplast markers showed high homology (almost 100 %) between most species analysed. Analyses based on seven nuclear microsatellites confirmed weak population genetic structure among Prosopis species. Hybrids and polyploid individuals were recorded in both native and non-native populations. Invasive genotypes of Prosopis juliflora in Kenya and Ethiopia could have a similar native Mexican origin, while Tanzanian genotypes likely are from a different source. Native Peruvian Prosopis pallida genotypes showed high similarity with non-invasive genotypes from Kenya. Levels of introduced genetic diversity, relative to native populations, suggest that multiple introductions of P. juliflora and P. pallida occurred in Eastern Africa. Polyploidy may explain the successful invasion of P. juliflora in Eastern Africa. The polyploid P. juliflora was highly differentiated from the rest of the (diploid) species within the genus. The lack of genetic differentiation between most diploid species in their native ranges supports the notion that hybridization between allopatric species may occur frequently when they are co-introduced into non-native areas. For regulatory purposes, we propose to treat diploid Prosopis taxa from the Americas as a single taxonomic unit in non-native ranges.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-12-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; polyploidy; invasion success; Prosopis juliflora; invasive species\",\"subject\":\"polyploidy; invasion success; Prosopis juliflora; invasive species\",\"authors\":\"Castillo, Mar\\u00eda L; Schaffner, Urs; Wilgen, Brian W; Monta\\u00f1o, No\\u00e9 Manuel; O Bustamante, Ramiro; Cosacov, Andrea; Mathese, Megan J; Roux, Johannes J Le\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111168443\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"3164c56e472fee71fa0816bd0a8fa586eeff189be478b132423cfdedcbadf8a3\",\"relevance\":28,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Castillo, Mar\\u00eda L; Schaffner, Urs; Wilgen, Brian W; Monta\\u00f1o, No\\u00e9 Manuel; O Bustamante, Ramiro; Cosacov, Andrea; Mathese, Megan J; Roux, Johannes J Le\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55310218395163e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55091476718558e-27\",\"labels\":\"3164c56e472fee71fa0816bd0a8fa586eeff189be478b132423cfdedcbadf8a3\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"322ab67be0a68535fd9527c6baaf67330762451076055fad7afa35d700e23431\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q38383053; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q38383053; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4736984; doi:10.7717\\/PEERJ.1559\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q38383053; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q38383053; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4736984; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7717\\/PEERJ.1559\",\"title\":\"Non-native species in the vascular flora of highlands and mountains of Iceland\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The highlands and mountains of Iceland are one of the largest remaining wilderness areas in Europe. This study aimed to provide comprehensive and up-to-date data on non-native plant species in these areas and to answer the following questions: (1) How many non-native vascular plant species inhabit highland and mountainous environments in Iceland? (2) Do temporal trends in the immigration of alien species to Iceland differ between highland and lowland areas? (3) Does the incidence of alien species in the disturbed and undisturbed areas within Icelandic highlands differ? (4) Does the spread of non-native species in Iceland proceed from lowlands to highlands? and (5) Can we detect hot-spots in the distribution of non-native taxa within the highlands? Overall, 16 non-native vascular plant species were detected, including 11 casuals and 5 naturalized taxa (1 invasive). Results showed that temporal trends in alien species immigration to highland and lowland areas are similar, but it is clear that the process of colonization of highland areas is still in its initial phase. Non-native plants tended to occur close to man-made infrastructure and buildings including huts, shelters, roads etc. Analysis of spatio-temporal patterns showed that the spread within highland areas is a second step in non-native plant colonization in Iceland. Several statically significant hot spots of alien plant occurrences were identified using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic and these were linked to human disturbance.

In certain regions where both species have been introduced, L. sativae has displaced L. trifolii, whereas the opposite has occurred in other regions. These opposing outcomes suggest that neither species is an inherently superior competitor. The regions where these displacements have been observed (southern China, Japan and western USA) are climatically different. We determined whether temperature differentially affects the reproductive success of these species and therefore if climatic differences could affect the outcome of interspecific interactions where these species are sympatric. The results of life table parameters indicate that both species can develop successfully at all tested temperatures (20, 25, 31, 33\\u00b0C). L. sativae had consistently higher fecundities at all temperatures, but L. trifolii developed to reproductive age faster. Age-stage specific survival rates were higher for L. sativae at low temperatures, but these were higher for L. trifolii at higher temperatures. We then compared the net reproductive rates (R0) for both species in pure and mixed cultures maintained at the same four constant temperatures. Both species had significantly lower net reproductive rates in mixed species cultures compared with their respective pure species cultures, indicating that both species are subject to intense interspecific competition. Net reproductive rates were significantly greater for L. sativae than for L. trifolii in mixed species groups at the lower temperatures, whereas the opposite occurred at the higher temperature. Therefore, interactions between the species are temperature dependent and small differences could shift the competitive balance between the species.

There is therefore a critical need for a standardised method to evaluate, compare, and eventually predict the magnitudes of these different impacts. Here, we propose a straightforward system for classifying alien species according to the magnitude of their environmental impacts, based on the mechanisms of impact used to code species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Invasive Species Database, which are presented here for the first time. The classification system uses five semi-quantitative scenarios describing impacts under each mechanism to assign species to different levels of impact-ranging from Minimal to Massive-with assignment corresponding to the highest level of deleterious impact associated with any of the mechanisms. The scheme also includes categories for species that are Not Evaluated, have No Alien Population, or are Data Deficient, and a method for assigning uncertainty to all the classifications. We show how this classification system is applicable at different levels of ecological complexity and different spatial and temporal scales, and embraces existing impact metrics. In fact, the scheme is analogous to the already widely adopted and accepted Red List approach to categorising extinction risk, and so could conceivably be readily integrated with existing practices and policies in many regions.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-05\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasive species; environmental effects; introduced species; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"invasive species; environmental effects; introduced species; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Blackburn, Tim M; Essl, Franz; Evans, Thomas; Hulme, Philip E; Jeschke, Jonathan M; K\\u00fchn, Ingolf; Kumschick, Sabrina; Markov\\u00e1, Zuzana; Mruga\\u0142a, Agata; Nentwig, Wolfgang; Pergl, Jan; Py\\u0161ek, Petr; Rabitsch, Wolfgang; Ricciardi, Anthony; Richardson, David M; Sendek, Agnieszka; Vil\\u00e0, Montserrat; Wilson, John R U; Winter, Marten; Genovesi, Piero; Bacher, Sven\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q21090167\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"37f9da318669c825993745611b863574b7e640f6f4233011cf970a8bb9bc1f46\",\"relevance\":54,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Blackburn, Tim M; Essl, Franz; Evans, Thomas; Hulme, Philip E; Jeschke, Jonathan M; K\\u00fchn, Ingolf; Kumschick, Sabrina; Markov\\u00e1, Zuzana; Mruga\\u0142a, Agata; Nentwig, Wolfgang; Pergl, Jan; Py\\u0161ek, Petr; Rabitsch, Wolfgang; Ricciardi, Anthony; Bacher, Sven\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12724545303737e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37655090167269e-27\",\"labels\":\"37f9da318669c825993745611b863574b7e640f6f4233011cf970a8bb9bc1f46\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"3c44544fa4ae086e391263176f71500cb0275c6006ed01ba150ab97161a0e8f1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q33777840; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q33777840; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4063473; doi:10.1002\\/ECE3.1056\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q33777840; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q33777840; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4063473; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1002\\/ECE3.1056\",\"title\":\"Optimal surveillance strategy for invasive species management when surveys stop after detection\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Invasive species are a cause for concern in natural and economic systems and require both monitoring and management. There is a trade-off between the amount of resources spent on surveying for the species and conducting early management of occupied sites, and the resources that are ultimately spent in delayed management at sites where the species was present but undetected. Previous work addressed this optimal resource allocation problem assuming that surveys continue despite detection until the initially planned survey effort is consumed. However, a more realistic scenario is often that surveys stop after detection (i.e., follow a \\\"removal\\\" sampling design) and then management begins. Such an approach will indicate a different optimal survey design and can be expected to be more efficient. We analyze this case and compare the expected efficiency of invasive species management programs under both survey methods. We also evaluate the impact of mis-specifying the type of sampling approach during the program design phase. We derive analytical expressions that optimize resource allocation between monitoring and management in surveillance programs when surveys stop after detection. We do this under a scenario of unconstrained resources and scenarios where survey budget is constrained. The efficiency of surveillance programs is greater if a \\\"removal survey\\\" design is used, with larger gains obtained when savings from early detection are high, occupancy is high, and survey costs are not much lower than early management costs at a site. Designing a surveillance program disregarding that surveys stop after detection can result in an efficiency loss. Our results help guide the design of future surveillance programs for invasive species. Addressing program design within a decision-theoretic framework can lead to a better use of available resources. We show how species prevalence, its detectability, and the benefits derived from early detection can be considered.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-04-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; invasion biology; invasive species; invasive species management; invasion management\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; invasive species; invasive species management; invasion management\",\"authors\":\"Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta; Hauser, Cindy E; McCarthy, Michael A\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q33777840\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"3c44544fa4ae086e391263176f71500cb0275c6006ed01ba150ab97161a0e8f1\",\"relevance\":35,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Guillera-Arroita, Gurutzeta; Hauser, Cindy E; McCarthy, Michael A\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.06349860133877e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77386957493733e-27\",\"labels\":\"3c44544fa4ae086e391263176f71500cb0275c6006ed01ba150ab97161a0e8f1\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"3e47fd858048023b2fe524741233c53f72eea81eb2fda7ef9454fc735c540ec0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34216070; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q34216070; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4169606; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0108296\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34216070; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q34216070; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4169606; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0108296\",\"title\":\"Invasiveness does not predict impact: response of native land snail communities to plant invasions in riparian habitats\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Studies of plant invasions rarely address impacts on molluscs. By comparing pairs of invaded and corresponding uninvaded plots in 96 sites in floodplain forests, we examined effects of four invasive alien plants (Impatiens glandulifera, Fallopia japonica, F. sachalinensis, and F.\\u00d7 bohemica) in the Czech Republic on communities of land snails. The richness and abundance of living land snail species were recorded separately for all species, rare species listed on the national Red List, and small species with shell size below 5 mm. The significant impacts ranged from 16-48% reduction in snail species numbers, and 29-90% reduction in abundance. Small species were especially prone to reduction in species richness by all four invasive plant taxa. Rare snails were also negatively impacted by all plant invaders, both in terms of species richness or abundance. Overall, the impacts on snails were invader-specific, differing among plant taxa. The strong effect of I. glandulifera could be related to the post-invasion decrease in abundance of tall nitrophilous native plant species that are a nutrient-rich food source for snails in riparian habitats.

In Andean Patagonia, southern Argentina and Chile, many non-native animals have been introduced and are currently spreading. On Isla Victoria, Nahuel Huapi National Park, many non-native vertebrates were introduced ca. 1937. Records indicate that several native vertebrates were present before these species were introduced. We hypothesize that seven decades after the introduction of non-native species and without appropriate management to maintain native diversity, non-native vertebrates have displaced native species (given the known invasiveness and impacts of some of the introduced species). We conducted direct censuses in linear transects 500 m long (n= 10) in parallel with camera-trapping (1,253 camera-days) surveys in two regions of the island with different levels of disturbance: high (n= 4) and low (n= 6) to study the community of terrestrial mammals and birds and the relative abundances of native and non-native species. Results show that currently non-native species are dominant across all environments; 60.4% of census records and 99.7% of camera trapping records are of non-native animals. We detected no native large mammals; the assemblage of large vertebrates consisted of five non-native mammals and one non-native bird. Native species detected were one small mammal and one small bird. Species with the highest trapping rate were red and fallow deer, wild boar, silver pheasant (all four species are non-native) and chucao (a native bird).

These habitats are especially important in urban areas, where they can help conserve native grassland species and communities in urban greenspace. However, they can also provide further footholds for potentially invasive alien species that already characterize urban areas. In order to implement power line corridors into urban conservation, it is important to understand which environmental conditions in the corridors favor grassland species and which alien species. Likewise it is important to know whether similar environmental factors in the corridors control the species composition of the two groups. We conducted a vegetation study in a 43 kilometer long urban power line corridor network in south-western Finland, and used generalized linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis to determine which environmental factors best predict the occurrence and composition of grassland and alien plant species in the corridors. The results imply that old corridors on dry soils and steep slopes characterized by a history as open areas and pastures are especially suitable for grassland species. Corridors suitable for alien species, in turn, are characterized by productive soils and abundant light and are surrounded by a dense urban fabric. Factors controlling species composition in the two groups are somewhat correlated, with the most important factors including light abundance, soil moisture, soil calcium concentration and soil productivity. The results have implications for grassland conservation and invasive alien species control in urban areas.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2015-11-13\",\"subject_orig\":\"disturbance hypothesis; wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q115794757; hypothesis:disturbance hypothesis; hypothesis:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q115794757; theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; Finland; habitat; grassland; invasion biology; invasion management; urban invasion\",\"subject\":\"disturbance hypothesis; Finland; habitat; grassland; invasion biology; invasion management; urban invasion\",\"authors\":\"Lampinen, Jussi; Ruokolainen, Kalle; Huhta, Ari-Pekka\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34501624\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"4092a0f02ce5c1e8c9ae6ba3b4a1e0ddb11a529858556c1038f6139451fc52b6\",\"relevance\":99,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Lampinen, Jussi; Ruokolainen, Kalle; Huhta, Ari-Pekka\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\",\"hypothesis\":\"disturbance hypothesis\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.06344952379279e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77386550383076e-27\",\"labels\":\"4092a0f02ce5c1e8c9ae6ba3b4a1e0ddb11a529858556c1038f6139451fc52b6\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"41d20ab123b19cc1c5b3eb4ba12a65514b41b5c5da2e35cdd4547b5d13710fd5\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110756744; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q110756744; doi:10.1007\\/S10750-021-04710-X\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110756744; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q110756744; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/S10750-021-04710-X\",\"title\":\"Impact of Nitellopsis obtusa (Desv.)

One explanation for invasive species success is their release from concurrent natural enemies upon introduction to the non-native range. The so-called enemy release hypothesis (ERH) has conflicting support, depending upon the ecosystem and species investigated. To date, most studies testing the generality of the ERH have focused on terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we tested whether enemy release might contribute to the success of the invasive non-native brown seaweeds Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum muticum in the United Kingdom. We conducted choice and no choice experiments to determine herbivore preference on these invaders relative to six functionally-similar native species. We also measured and compared species traits associated with defence against herbivory (carbon to nitrogen ratio, polyphenolic concentration, tensile strength, and compensatory growth). There were no differences in the biomass consumed between invasive and native species for either choice or no choice tests. The carbon to nitrogen ratio (a measure of nutritional quality) was significantly lower for S. muticum compared to the three native fucoid species, but measures of the other three defence traits were similar or even greater for invasive species compared with native species. Taken together, it is unlikely that the ERH applies to invasive seaweeds in the northeast Atlantic, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the success of invasive species in this system.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2022-09-05\",\"subject_orig\":\"enemy release hypothesis; wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q85759287; hypothesis:enemy release hypothesis; hypothesis:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q85759287; theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; invasion success; herbivory; functional trait\",\"subject\":\"enemy release hypothesis; invasion success; herbivory; functional trait\",\"authors\":\"Mabey, Abigail L.; Catford, Jane A.; Rius, Marc; Foggo, Andrew; Smale, Dan A.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q114955653\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"45b5213e8a9b36fbebfdc9ceb1130501488d8279beb7d2624ae88ab898f3b3b5\",\"relevance\":85,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"unknown\",\"dclanguage\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Mabey, Abigail L.; Catford, Jane A.; Rius, Marc; Foggo, Andrew; Smale, Dan A.\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\",\"hypothesis\":\"enemy release hypothesis\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55357610676524e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55088704251773e-27\",\"labels\":\"45b5213e8a9b36fbebfdc9ceb1130501488d8279beb7d2624ae88ab898f3b3b5\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"45f0de9c8b80b05a0cd7daf7c6d9dd0466fe727b168e0a0a8efab496e22de79a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34109966; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q34109966; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4149425; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0105495\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34109966; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q34109966; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4149425; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0105495\",\"title\":\"The public and professionals reason similarly about the management of non-native invasive species: a quantitative investigation of the relationship between beliefs and attitudes\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Despite continued critique of the idea of clear boundaries between scientific and lay knowledge, the 'deficit-model' of public understanding of ecological issues still seems prevalent in discourses of biodiversity management. Prominent invasion biologists, for example, still argue that citizens need to be educated so that they accept scientists' views on the management of non-native invasive species. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey with members of the public and professionals in invasive species management (n = 732) in Canada and the UK to investigate commonalities and differences in their perceptions of species and, more importantly, how these perceptions were connected to attitudes towards species management. Both native and non-native mammal and tree species were included. Professionals tended to have more extreme views than the public, especially in relation to nativeness and abundance of a species. In both groups, species that were perceived to be more abundant, non-native, unattractive or harmful to nature and the economy were more likely to be regarded as in need of management. While perceptions of species and attitudes towards management thus often differed between public and professionals, these perceptions were linked to attitudes in very similar ways across the two groups. This suggests that ways of reasoning about invasive species employed by professionals and the public might be more compatible with each other than commonly thought. We recommend that managers and local people engage in open discussion about each other's beliefs and attitudes prior to an invasive species control programme. This could ultimately reduce conflict over invasive species control.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-08-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; invasion biology; invasive species; invasive species management; invasion management\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; invasive species; invasive species management; invasion management\",\"authors\":\"Fischer, Anke; Selge, Sebastian; Wal, Ren\\u00e9; Larson, Brendon M H\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34109966\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"45f0de9c8b80b05a0cd7daf7c6d9dd0466fe727b168e0a0a8efab496e22de79a\",\"relevance\":108,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Fischer, Anke; Selge, Sebastian; Wal, Ren\\u00e9; Larson, Brendon M H\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.06347685114273e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77391127053438e-27\",\"labels\":\"45f0de9c8b80b05a0cd7daf7c6d9dd0466fe727b168e0a0a8efab496e22de79a\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"5013f8be127b5f83ef075d4fe043c6cc57aee043aba2c87e9fdefde0ef602e53\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q47568180; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q47568180; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0189138\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q47568180; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q47568180; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0189138\",\"title\":\"Risk assessment and spread of the potentially invasive Ceratitis rosa Karsch and Ceratitis quilicii De Meyer, Mwatawala & Virgilio sp.

Both species are tephritid pests threatening the production of horticultural crops in Africa and beyond. Studies were carried out by constructing thermal reaction norms for each life stage of both species at constant and fluctuating temperatures. Non-linear functions were fitted to continuously model species development, mortality, longevity and oviposition to establish phenology models that were stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters of each species. For spatial analysis of pest risk, three generic risk indices were visualized using the advanced Insect Life Cycle Modeling software. The study revealed that the highest fecundity, intrinsic rate of natural increase and net reproductive rate for C. rosa and C. quilicii was at 25 and 30\\u00b0C, respectively. The resulting model successfully fits the known distribution of C. rosa and C. quilicii in Africa and the two Indian Ocean islands of La R\\u00e9union and Mauritius. Globally, the model highlights the substantial invasion risk posed by C. rosa and C. quilicii to cropping regions in the Americas, Australia, India, China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and West and Central Africa. However, the proportion of the regions predicted to be climatically suitable for both pests is narrower for C. rosa in comparison with C. quilicii, suggesting that C. quilicii will be more tolerant to a wider range of climatic conditions than C. rosa. This implies that these pests are of significant concern to biosecurity agencies in the uninvaded regions.

However, most plant groups studied in detail (e.g. pines and acacias) have a high percentage of invasive taxa. Here we examine the global introduction history and invasion ecology of Proteaceae--a large plant family with many taxa that have been widely disseminated by humans, but with few known invaders. To do this we compiled a global list of species and used boosted regression tree models to assess which factors are important in determining the status of a species (not introduced, introduced, naturalized or invasive). At least 402 of 1674 known species (24%) have been moved by humans out of their native ranges, 58 species (14%) have become naturalized but not invasive, and 8 species (2%) are invasive. The probability of naturalization was greatest for species with large native ranges, low susceptibility to Phytophthora root-rot fungus, large mammal-dispersed seeds, and with the capacity to resprout. The probability of naturalized species becoming invasive was greatest for species with large native ranges, those used as barrier plants, tall species, species with small seeds, and serotinous species. The traits driving invasiveness of Proteaceae were similar to those for acacias and pines. However, while some traits showed a consistent influence at introduction, naturalization and invasion, others appear to be influential at one stage only, and some have contrasting effects at different stages. Trait-based analyses therefore need to consider different invasion stages separately. On their own, these observations provide little predictive power for risk assessment, but when the causative mechanisms are understood (e.g. Phytophthora susceptibility) they provide valuable insights. As such there is considerable value in seeking the correlates and mechanisms underlying invasions for particular taxonomic or functional groups.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-09-24\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; invasion biology; invasion success; naturalization; Proteaceae; invasive plant\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; invasion success; naturalization; Proteaceae; invasive plant\",\"authors\":\"Moodley, Desika; Geerts, Sjirk; Richardson, David M; Wilson, John R U\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q37196033\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"54de286d3ea3c67bed448db7c334a8746e58e617186f4dea8cba3595027ce4f9\",\"relevance\":82,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Moodley, Desika; Geerts, Sjirk; Richardson, David M; Wilson, John R U\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55316015262675e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55089986175838e-27\",\"labels\":\"54de286d3ea3c67bed448db7c334a8746e58e617186f4dea8cba3595027ce4f9\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"55d6ab2d0571980e35223606d9e3baa181b3617aae998405f64980f547ca7ef1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q56333122; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q56333122; doi:10.1007\\/S10530-017-1378-4\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q56333122; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q56333122; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/S10530-017-1378-4\",\"title\":\"Assessing the ecological impacts of invasive species based on their functional responses and abundances\",\"paper_abstract\":\"AbstractInvasive species management requires allocation of limited resources towards the proactive mitigation of those species that could elicit the highest ecological impacts. However, we lack predictive capacity with respect to the identities and degree of ecological impacts of invasive species. Here, we combine the relative per capita effects and relative field abundances of invader as compared to native species into a new metric, \\u201cRelative Impact Potential\\u201d (RIP), and test whether this metric can reliably predict high impact invaders. This metric tests the impact of invaders relative to the baseline impacts of natives on the broader ecological community. We first derived the functional responses (i.e. per capita effects) of two ecologically damaging invasive fish species in Europe, the Ponto-Caspian round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and Asian topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), and their native trophic analogues, the bullhead (Cottus gobio; also C. bairdi) and bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), towards several prey species. This establishes the existence and relative strengths of the predator\\u2013prey relationships. Then, we derived ecologically comparable field abundance estimates of the invader and native fish from surveys and literature. This establishes the multipliers for the above per capita effects. Despite both predators having known severe detrimental field impacts, their functional responses alone were of modest predictive power in this regard; however, incorporation of their abundances relative to natives into the RIP metric gave high predictive power. We present invader\\/native RIP biplots that provide an intuitive visualisation of comparisons among the invasive and native species, reflecting the known broad ecological impacts of the invaders. Thus, we provide a mechanistic understanding of invasive species impacts and a predictive tool for use by practitioners, for example, in risk assessments.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017-02-08\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasive species; invasion biology; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"invasive species; invasion biology; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Laverty, Ciaran; Green, Kyle D.; Dick, Jaimie T.

However, few studies have examined the physiological mechanisms that theoretically underlie this differential success. Because correlative evidence suggests that invasiveness is related to the width of a species' latitudinal range, it has been assumed--but largely untested--that range width predicts breadth of habitat temperatures and physiological thermotolerances. In this study, we use empirical data from a marine community as a case study to address the hypotheses that (1) geographic temperature range attributes are related to temperature tolerance, leading to greater eurythermality in invasive species, and (2) stress protein expression is a subcellular mechanism that could contribute to differences in thermotolerance. We examined three native and six invasive species common in the subtidal epibenthic communities of California, USA. We assessed thermotolerance by exposing individuals to temperatures between 14\\u00b0C and 31\\u00b0C and determining the temperature lethal to 50% of individuals (LT(50)) after a 24 hour exposure. We found a strong positive relationship between the LT(50) and both maximum habitat temperatures and the breadth of temperatures experience across the species' ranges. In addition, of the species in our study, invasives tended to inhabit broader habitat temperature ranges and higher maximum temperatures. Stress protein expression may contribute to these differences: the more thermotolerant, invasive species Diplosoma listerianum expressed higher levels of a 70-kDa heat-shock protein than the less thermotolerant, native Distaplia occidentalis for which levels declined sharply above the LT(50). Our data highlight differences between native and invasive species with respect to organismal and cellular temperature tolerances.

Several studies have shown the value of comparing the functional responses (FRs) of alien and native predators towards native prey, however, the technique is under-explored with herbivorous alien species and as a predictor of invasiveness as distinct from ecological impact. Here, in China, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to compare the FRs among three herbivorous snail species: the golden apple snail, Pomacea canaliculata, a highly invasive and high impact alien listed in \\\"100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species\\\"; Planorbarius corneus, a non-invasive, low impact alien; and the Chinese native snail, Bellamya aeruginosa, when feeding on four locally occurring plant species. Further, by using a numerical response equation, we modelled the population dynamics of the snail consumers. For standard FR parameters, we found that the invasive and damaging alien snail had the highest \\\"attack rates\\\" a, shortest \\\"handling times\\\" h and also the highest estimated maximum feeding rates, 1\\/hT, whereas the native species had the lowest attack rates, longest handling times and lowest maximum feeding rates. The non-invasive, low impact alien species had consistently intermediate FR parameters. The invasive alien species had higher population growth potential than the native snail species, whilst that of the non-invasive alien species was intermediate. Thus, while the comparative FR approach has been proposed as a reliable method for predicting the ecological impacts of invasive predators, our results further suggest that comparative FRs could extend to predict the invasiveness and ecological impacts of alien herbivores and should be explored in other taxa and trophic groups to determine the general utility of the approach.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-01-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; herbivory; invasion biology; invasiveness; invasion impact; invasion success\",\"subject\":\"herbivory; invasion biology; invasiveness; invasion impact; invasion success\",\"authors\":\"Xu, Meng; Mu, Xidong; Dick, Jaimie T A; Fang, Miao; Gu, Dangen; Zhang, Jiaen; Luo, Jianren; Hu, Yinchang\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34509214\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5b484df0d7c6b76905c8a153d91eda075828c2f86a525e6e4908e6851b5e1d33\",\"relevance\":63,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Xu, Meng; Mu, Xidong; Dick, Jaimie T A; Fang, Miao; Gu, Dangen; Zhang, Jiaen; Luo, Jianren; Hu, Yinchang\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.5525399269643e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55090243419783e-27\",\"labels\":\"5b484df0d7c6b76905c8a153d91eda075828c2f86a525e6e4908e6851b5e1d33\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"5fe819a54578b333b299f6d8ad7ded90d376fe1b999df1ade8f0c122dd96e89d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q114749963; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q114749963; doi:10.3389\\/FPLS.2022.875824\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q114749963; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q114749963; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/FPLS.2022.875824\",\"title\":\"The Impact of Multiple Species Invasion on Soil and Plant Communities Increases With Invasive Species Co-occurrence\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Despite increasing evidence indicating that invasive species are harming biodiversity, ecological systems and processes, impacts of multiple species invasion and their links with changes in plant and soil communities are inadequately documented and remain poorly understood. Addressing multiple invaders would help to ward against community-wide, synergistic effects, aiding in designing more effective control strategies. In this work, correlative relationships are examined for potential impacts of three co-occurring invasive plant species, Amorpha fruticosa, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, and Acer negundo, on soil conditions and native plant diversity. The research was conducted in riparian ecosystems and included the following treatments: (1) co-occurrence of the three invasive plant species, (2) occurrence of a single invasive species, and (3) control, i.e., absence of invasive species. Co-occurrence of three invasive plant species caused higher direct impact on soil properties, soil functioning, and native plant diversity. Soil in mixed plots (those populated with all three invaders) contained higher levels of nitrifying bacteria, organic matter, nitrogen, and carbon as well as lower carbon to nitrogen ratio as compared to single species invaded plots and control plots. Furthermore, native plant diversity decreased with invasive plants co-occurrence. Differences in soil conditions and lower native plant diversity revealed the interactive potential of multiple invasive species in depleting biodiversity and eroding soil functionality, ultimately affecting ecological and biogeochemical processes both below and above ground. Our results highlight the need to prevent the impact of multispecies invasion, suggesting that riparian ecosystems affected by co-occurring invaders should be prioritized for invasion monitoring and ecological restoration.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2022-05-31\",\"subject_orig\":\"invasional meltdown hypothesis; wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q115322315; hypothesis:invasional meltdown hypothesis; hypothesis:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q115322315; theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasive species; invasion impact; biological invasion\",\"subject\":\"invasional meltdown hypothesis; invasive species; invasion impact; biological invasion\",\"authors\":\"Losapio, Gianalberto; Mili\\u0107, Stanko; Mili\\u0107, Dubravka\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q114749963\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5fe819a54578b333b299f6d8ad7ded90d376fe1b999df1ade8f0c122dd96e89d\",\"relevance\":91,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"unknown\",\"dclanguage\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Losapio, Gianalberto; Mili\\u0107, Stanko; Mili\\u0107, Dubravka\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\",\"hypothesis\":\"invasional meltdown hypothesis\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12722617288399e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37653426336097e-27\",\"labels\":\"5fe819a54578b333b299f6d8ad7ded90d376fe1b999df1ade8f0c122dd96e89d\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"61db4bf487495ce93841ad34f318220124cb3cba0dfd0ccf3d61c9a4d82b2f9a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111322414; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q111322414; doi:10.3390\\/PLANTS10122587\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111322414; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q111322414; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/PLANTS10122587\",\"title\":\"Impacts of Nicotiana glauca Graham Invasion on the Vegetation Composition and Soil: A Case Study of Taif, Western Saudi Arabia\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Invasive species are considered a serious problem in different ecosystems worldwide. They can compete and interfere with native plants, leading to a shift in community assembly and ecosystem function. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Nicotiana glauca Graham invasion on native vegetation composition and soil of the most invaded locations in the Taif region, Western Saudi Arabia, including Alwaht (WHT), Ar-Ruddaf (RDF), and Ash-shafa (SHFA). Plant species list, life span, life form, and chorotypes were assessed. Six locations highly infested with N. glauca shrubs were selected, and the morphological parameters of the shrubs were measured. Within each location, richness, evenness, relative density of species, and soil were measured either under the canopy of N. glauca shrubs or outside the canopy. Floristic analysis revealed the existence of 144 plant species, mainly perennial. The shrubs at the SHFA1 location showed the highest values of all measured morphological parameters. The WHT 1 location showed high richness and evenness, while the WHAT 2 location showed less richness and evenness. The invaded locations showed substantial variation in the community composition. Additionally, the effect of N. glauca on the understory species varied from competition to facilitation, where most of the understory species were inhibited. As an average of all locations, 65.86% of the plant species were recorded only outside the canopy of N. glauca. The vegetation analysis revealed that the SHFA location is more vulnerable to invasion that could be ascribed to its wide range of habitats and high disturbance. The soil\\u2013vegetation relationships showed significant variations among the studied locations regarding soil composition, and thereby showed a wide ecological range of the invasive shrubs N. glauca. Therefore, the invasion of N. glauca in the Taif region altered the species interactions, nutrients, and soil properties.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021-11-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; Nicotiana glauca; invasive species; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"Nicotiana glauca; invasive species; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Assaeed, Abdulaziz M; Alharthi, Abdullah S; El-Gawad, Ahmed Mohamed Abd\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111322414\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"61db4bf487495ce93841ad34f318220124cb3cba0dfd0ccf3d61c9a4d82b2f9a\",\"relevance\":37,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Assaeed, Abdulaziz M; Alharthi, Abdullah S; El-Gawad, Ahmed Mohamed Abd\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12727735950007e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37654746929997e-27\",\"labels\":\"61db4bf487495ce93841ad34f318220124cb3cba0dfd0ccf3d61c9a4d82b2f9a\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"62bccd70eb21230cb1c067c4f3fe3329c9984c06c428f309d6e8f53400f885d1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q36790301; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q36790301; doi:10.3390\\/IJMS14034793\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q36790301; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q36790301; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/IJMS14034793\",\"title\":\"Rapid Microsatellite Marker Development Using Next Generation Pyrosequencing to Inform Invasive Burmese Python-Python molurus bivittatus-Management\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Invasive species represent an increasing threat to native ecosystems, harming indigenous taxa through predation, habitat modification, cross-species hybridization and alteration of ecosystem processes. Additionally, high economic costs are associated with environmental damage, restoration and control measures. The Burmese python, Python molurus bivittatus, is one of the most notable invasive species in the US, due to the threat it poses to imperiled species and the Greater Everglades ecosystem. To address population structure and relatedness, next generation sequencing was used to rapidly produce species-specific microsatellite loci. The Roche 454 GS-FLX Titanium platform provided 6616 di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats in 117,516 sequences. Using stringent criteria, 24 of 26 selected tri- and tetra-nucleotide loci were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and 18 were polymorphic. An additional six cross-species loci were amplified, and the resulting 24 loci were incorporated into eight PCR multiplexes. Multi-locus genotypes yielded an average of 61% (39%-77%) heterozygosity and 3.7 (2-6) alleles per locus. Population-level studies using the developed microsatellites will track the invasion front and monitor population-suppression dynamics. Additionally, cross-species amplification was detected in the invasive Ball, P. regius, and Northern African python, P. sebae. These markers can be used to address the hybridization potential of Burmese pythons and the larger, more aggressive P. sebae.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-02-28\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; Myanmar; microsatellite; Python molurus; invasive species; invasion management; pyrosequencing\",\"subject\":\"Myanmar; microsatellite; Python molurus; invasive species; invasion management; pyrosequencing\",\"authors\":\"Hunter, Margaret E; Hart, Kristen M\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q36790301\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"62bccd70eb21230cb1c067c4f3fe3329c9984c06c428f309d6e8f53400f885d1\",\"relevance\":78,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Hunter, Margaret E; Hart, Kristen M\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.0634787022828e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77384353308572e-27\",\"labels\":\"62bccd70eb21230cb1c067c4f3fe3329c9984c06c428f309d6e8f53400f885d1\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"64657e1b37ce716772b1644e575f20331538c45d841d07c23a9aef32ae577ace\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q56355672; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q56355672; doi:10.4102\\/ABC.V47I2.2138\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q56355672; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q56355672; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.4102\\/ABC.V47I2.2138\",\"title\":\"Optimising invasive fish management in the context of invasive species legislation in South Africa\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: South Africa hosts a large number of non-native freshwater fishes that were introduced for various industries. Many of these species are now listed under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM:BA) Alien and Invasive Species (AIS) lists and regulations, though the practical options available to conservation agencies to effectively manage these fishes vary greatly among species and regions. Objectives methods: We assessed the history and status of national legislation pertaining to invasive freshwater fishes, and the practical implications of the legislation for managing different species with contrasting distributions, impacts and utilisation value. Results: The smallmouth bass, despite being a potential conflict-generating species, is fairly straightforward to manage based on current legislation. Two species of trout, which remain absent from the NEM:BA AIS lists because of ongoing consultation with stakeholders, continue to be managed in regions like the Western Cape province using existing provincial legislation. To maximise the limited capacity for management within conservation agencies, we proposed a decision-support tool that prioritises invasive fish populations that represent high environmental risk and low potential for conflict with stakeholders. Using three case studies, we demonstrated how the tool can be used to set management goals of \\u2018eradicate\\u2019, \\u2018manage against impacts and further spread\\u2019 and \\u2018continue to monitor population\\u2019 as the most pragmatic solutions given the state of an invasion, its socio-economic impact and the capacity of the responsible agency to act.

The terminology for categorization of invasive species is examined in the context of their bias(es), which complicates control. An example of a newly determined native species, which is also invasive, is used as an example to navigate control and regulatory issues. Native, invasive reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) occurs throughout Minnesota and most likely the entire midwest region of central United States and Canadian provinces. The species was previously assumed to be an exotic, nonnative Eurasian import but recent molecular evidence supports its status as a native but invasive species. We address how this change to being a native but highly invasive species modifies approaches to mitigate its potential control for state, Tribal, and local authorities. The implications of these new findings will require differential shifts in land managers\\u2019 perspectives and approaches for control. Particular differences may exist for Tribal Land Managers vs. departments of natural resources and private agencies. Additionally, regulatory challenges have yet to be decided on how to legislate control for a native invasive species that had been previously assumed as exotic or foreign in origin.

To test this hypothesis, we exposed two sympatric species of Australian scincid lizards, Lampropholis delicata (invasive) and L. guichenoti (non-invasive) to standardized maze-learning tasks. Both species rapidly decreased the time they needed to find a food reward, but latencies were always higher for L. delicata than L. guichenoti. More detailed analysis showed that neither species actually learned the position of the food reward; they were as likely to turn the wrong way at the end of the study as at the beginning. Instead, their times decreased because they spent less time immobile in later trials; and L. guichenoti arrived at the reward sooner because they exhibited \\\"freezing\\\" (immobility) less than L. delicata.

We studied Poa annua , a cosmopolitan species found across all climatic zones and the only alien species that has successfully colonized the Antarctic. Our research questions were: (i) if harsh polar conditions restrict seed germination of P. annua and (ii) if the germination capacity of the Antarctic population of the species is due to high germination aptitude in the source population. We compared germination of seeds collected from eight populations around the world (maritime Antarctica, S Chile, W Argentina and E Argentina, NE USA, SW Croatia, C Poland and S Poland). We followed germination of seeds collected in the field and acquired from plants cultivated under unified optimal conditions. We found significant differences between populations in germination characteristics of seeds collected in the field. These could be associated with seed ripening in different locations. Seeds obtained under favorable conditions differed in stratification requirements.

Objectives: Specifically, it identified conflict-generating species, evaluated the causes and driving forces of these conflicts and assessed how the conflicts have affected management. Method: A simple scoring system was used to classify the alien species according to their relative degree of benefits and negative impacts. Conflict-generating species were then identified and further evaluated using an integrated cognitive hierarchy theory and risk perception framework to identify the value systems (intrinsic and economic) and risk perceptions associated with each conflict. Results: A total of 552 alien species were assessed. Most of the species were classified as inconsequential (55%) or destructive (29%). Beneficial (10%) and conflict-generating (6%) species made a minor contribution. The majority (46%) of the conflict cases were associated with more than one value system or both values and risk perception. The other conflicts cases were based on intrinsic (40%) and utilitarian (14%) value systems. Conclusions: Conflicts based on value and risk perceptions are inherently difficult to resolve because authorities need to balance the needs of different stakeholders while meeting the mandate of conserving the environment, ecosystem services and human well-being.

Numerous species of Indo-pacific origin have colonized the Mediterranean in recent times, including tropical symbiont-bearing foraminifera. Among these is the species Pararotalia calcariformata. Unlike other invasive foraminifera, this species was discovered only two decades ago and is restricted to the eastern Mediterranean coast. Combining ecological, genetic and physiological observations, we attempt to explain the recent invasion of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. Using morphological and genetic data, we confirm the species attribution to P. calcariformata McCulloch 1977 and identify its symbionts as a consortium of diatom species dominated by Minutocellus polymorphus. We document photosynthetic activity of its endosymbionts using Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometry and test the effects of elevated temperatures on growth rates of asexual offspring. The culturing of asexual offspring for 120 days shows a 30-day period of rapid growth followed by a period of slower growth. A subsequent 48-day temperature sensitivity experiment indicates a similar developmental pathway and high growth rate at 28\\u00b0C, whereas an almost complete inhibition of growth was observed at 20\\u00b0C and 35\\u00b0C. This indicates that the offspring of this species may have lower tolerance to cold temperatures than what would be expected for species native to the Mediterranean. We expand this hypothesis by applying a Species Distribution Model (SDM) based on modern occurrences in the Mediterranean using three environmental variables: irradiance, turbidity and yearly minimum temperature. The model reproduces the observed restricted distribution and indicates that the range of the species will drastically expand westwards under future global change scenarios. We conclude that P. calcariformata established a population in the Levant because of the recent warming in the region.

The influence of alien tree species on ecosystems is unevenly recognized and does not always account for different habitat specificity. We assessed the impacts of the three most frequent invasive tree species in European forests: Prunus serotina Ehrh., Quercus rubra L., and Robinia pseudoacacia L. on natural regeneration diversity, species composition, and density. We hypothesized that invaded forest types, in comparison with non-invaded, will differ in terms of species composition, will have lower taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of natural regeneration, and will have lower densities of native tree species. We used a set of 189 study plots (200 m2) in a systematic design, established in various forest types in Wielkopolski National Park (West Poland). We analyzed impacts of forest type, accounting for soil C:N ratio, soil pH, and light availability on natural regeneration (woody species up to 0.5 m height) species composition, diversity, and density. We found an overlap of species composition among invaded and non-invaded forests and low impacts of invasive species on taxonomic diversity and functional richness. We found no impacts on phylogenetic diversity and other functional diversity components. In contrast, we found that the natural regeneration of forest-forming tree species reached lower densities in invaded than non-invaded forest types. However, sub-canopy and shrub species reached higher densities in invaded than non-invaded forest types. We confirmed that invasive tree species affect natural regeneration by decreasing the regeneration density of native tree species (in eight of nine tree species studied), species composition homogenization, and supporting natural regeneration of sub-canopy and shrub species.

Although environmental, social, and economic benefits of control accrue to society, costs are borne by only a few individuals and organizations. For decades, policy makers have used incentives and sanctions to encourage or coerce individual actors to contribute to the public good, with limited success. Diverse, subnational efforts to collectively manage invasive plants, insects, and animals provide effective alternatives to traditional command-and-control approaches. Despite this work, there has been little systematic evaluation of collective efforts to determine whether there are consistent principles underpinning success. We reviewed 32 studies to identify the extent to which collective-action theories from related agricultural and environmental fields explain collaborative invasive species management approaches; describe and differentiate emergent invasive species collective-action efforts; and provide guidance on how to enable more collaborative approaches to invasive species management. We identified 4 types of collective action aimed at invasive species-externally led, community led, comanaged, and organizational coalitions-that provide blueprints for future invasive species management. Existing collective-action theories could explain the importance attributed to developing shared knowledge of the social-ecological system and the need for social capital. Yet, collection action on invasive species requires different types of monitoring, sanctions, and boundary definitions.

(Biol Invasions 1:3\\u201319, 1999). However, a practical approach for estimating the three components has been lacking. Here, we generalise the impact formula and, through use of regression models, estimate the relationship between the three components of impact, an approach we term GIRAE (Generalised Impact_=_Range size \\u00d7 Abundance \\u00d7 per-unit Effect). We discuss how GIRAE can be applied to multiple types of impact, including environmental impacts, damage and management costs. We propose two methods for applying GIRAE. The species-specific method computes the relationship between impact, range size, abundance and per-unit effect for a given species across multiple invaded sites or regions of different sizes. The multi-species method combines data from multiple species across multiple sites or regions to calculate a per-unit effect for each species and is computed using a single regression model. The species-specific method is more accurate, but it requires a large amount of data for each species and assumes a constant per-unit effect for a species across the invaded area. The multi-species method is more easily applicable and data-parsimonious, but assumes the same relationship between impact, range size and abundance for all considered species. We illustrate these methods using data about money spent managing plant invasions in different biomes of South Africa. We found clear differences between species in terms of money spent per unit area invaded, with per-unit expenditure varying substantially between biomes for some species\\u2014insights that are useful for monitoring and evaluating management.

Twenty plant species of alien origin differing in invasiveness were studied in terms of status and typical structures of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in urban habitats in Silesia Upland (southern Poland). We observed that 75_% of investigated plant species were mycorrhizal. The arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) of most plant species was of the Arum morphology. The nearly 100_% mycorrhizal frequency, high intensity of AM colonization within root cortex and the presence of arbuscules in all mycorrhizal plant species indicate that the investigated species are able to establish AM associations in the secondary range and urban habitats. DSE were present in all mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal species. The frequency of DSE was significantly lower in non-mycorrhizal group of plants, however, sclerotia of DSE were found mainly in the roots of non-mycorrhizal plant species. The group of species native to North America including three Solidago congeners have the highest values of all AM mycorrhization and DSE indices. Moreover, we observed that most mycorrhizal invasive species belonged to the family Asteraceae. In turn, representatives of Poaceae had the lowest values of AM mycorrhization. Nevertheless, quite high values of DSE frequency were also encountered in roots of Poaceae species. The high invasiveness of the representatives of the Asteraceae family from North America support theory that both taxonomic pattern, and the fact of root endophytes colonization contribute to invasion success. While, the taxa of Reynoutria also represent successful invaders but they are of Asiatic origin, non-mycorrhizal and weakly colonized by DSE fungi.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-02-19\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; urbanization; invasion biology; habitat; invasive species; invasive plant; biological invasion; urban habitat; invasion success; urban invasion\",\"subject\":\"urbanization; invasion biology; habitat; invasive species; invasive plant; biological invasion; urban habitat; invasion success; urban invasion\",\"authors\":\"Gucwa-Przepi\\u00f3ra, Ewa; Chmura, Damian; Soko\\u0142owska, Kamila\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35928436\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8573eda843a21821167cb1a86cbdfda159ccc3ddd0873bb0cea8b254df157fd8\",\"relevance\":83,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Gucwa-Przepi\\u00f3ra, Ewa; Chmura, Damian; Soko\\u0142owska, Kamila\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55295077719143e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55091453032175e-27\",\"labels\":\"8573eda843a21821167cb1a86cbdfda159ccc3ddd0873bb0cea8b254df157fd8\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"89359ef510e0e62197c10a2f615e9b6847451392dfb16531515a9960ef581636\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q26747773; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q26747773; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4852354; doi:10.1155\\/2016\\/5304028\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q26747773; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q26747773; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4852354; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2016\\/5304028\",\"title\":\"The Microbiome of Animals: Implications for Conservation Biology\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In recent years the human microbiome has become a growing area of research and it is becoming clear that the microbiome of humans plays an important role for human health.

In forest ecosystems, the threats caused by IAS include hybridization, transmission of diseases and species competition. This review sets out to analyze the impact of alien plant species on forest regeneration, which we consider to be one of the key stages in tree ecology for the survival of forest ecosystems in the future. The focus of the study is directly relevant to practitioners, forest managers and the conservation management of forests. With this systematic review, we aim to provide an overview of 48 research studies reporting on the impact and\\/or management of IAS in European temperate forests. We followed a multi-step protocol for compiling the publications for the literature review, with nine search queries producing a total of 3,825 hits. After several reduction rounds, we ended up with a grand total of 48 papers. We identified 53 vascular plant species having a negative influence on forest regeneration in Central European forests. In total, 21 tree species are reported to be impacted by IAS in 24 studies. The results of the review synthesis show that five impact mechanisms affect the regeneration success of native tree species: competition for resources, chemical impact on regeneration, physical impact on regeneration, structural impact on regeneration and indirect impact through interaction with other species. We identified in our synthesis management measures that have been recommended for application at different stages of biological invasions. The associated costs and required resources of management measures are under-reported or not accessible by reviewing the scientific literature. We can thus conclude that it is very import to improve the links between science and practical forest management.

Scientifically sound information is required to advise invasive species management strategies, where early detection and rapid response is particularly important. One approach to this is to determine: (i) the relative importance of pathways of invasion by which a species is introduced, (ii) the range of likely impacts associated with each species, and (iii) the relationship between pathways and impacts, to assess the relative threats posed by different pathways of alien species introductions. This assessment was performed on 139 alien plants that are invasive across the South African National Parks (19 national parks, covering ~39,000 km2), and based on available literature and expert opinion, known to have negative ecological impacts. For each species the likelihood of being introduced by each of eight pathways, and of having negative impacts in each of 13 identified impact categories, was assessed. The similarity of impact and pathway types between species was assessed using the Jaccard index and cladograms. Differences in the prevalence of impacts and pathways and relationships between these were assessed using a Chi-squared contingency and Generalised Linear Model. Nearly 80% of the species are ornamental plants and about 60% are also dispersed by rivers, highlighting the importance of managing ornamental species and surveillance along rivers in preventing future invasions. As to the impacts, ~95% of the species compete directly with native species and 70% change the physical structure of the environment. The majority of species exert multiple impacts, with 70% of species assessed having five or more impacts.

The scale of this challenge exceeds available resources and so it is essential to prioritise the management of invasive alien species. Species prioritisation for management typically involves a hierarchy of processes that consider the likelihood and scale of impact (risk assessment) and the feasibility, costs and effectiveness of management (risk management). Risk assessment processes are widely used, risk management less so, but are a crucial component of resource decision making. To assess the cost-effectiveness of prioritisation, we considered 26 high-risk species considered for eradication from Great Britain (GB) with pre-existing risk assessment and risk management outputs. We extracted scores to reflect the overall risk to GB posed by the species, together with the estimated cost and the overall feasibility of eradication. We used these to consider the relative reduction in risk per unit cost when managing prioritised species based on different criteria. We showed that the cost-effectiveness of prioritisation within our sample using risk assessment scores alone, performed no better than a random ranking of the species. In contrast, prioritisation including management feasibility produced nearly two orders of magnitude improvement compared to random. We conclude that basing management actions on priorities based solely on risk assessment without considering management feasibility risks the inefficient use of limited resources. In this study, the cost-effectiveness of species prioritisation for action was greatly increased by the inclusion of risk management assessment.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021-12-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; invasive species; invasive species management; invasion management\",\"subject\":\"invasive species; invasive species management; invasion management\",\"authors\":\"Robertson, Peter A; Mill, Aileen C; Adriaens, Tim; Moore, Niall; Vanderhoeven, Sonia; Essl, Franz; Booy, Olaf\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111322858\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8bead71d917af60ba4d279e2956bf9386ecf6f7872e56b91823a917d373bf4bd\",\"relevance\":80,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Robertson, Peter A; Mill, Aileen C; Adriaens, Tim; Moore, Niall; Vanderhoeven, Sonia; Essl, Franz; Booy, Olaf\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.06348790083843e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77387870981185e-27\",\"labels\":\"8bead71d917af60ba4d279e2956bf9386ecf6f7872e56b91823a917d373bf4bd\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"8cb4606b3b57fee73b809d6d60bbdaf07aed3ce5eee90a5a5486b528d86f1b3a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111149397; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q111149397; doi:10.3390\\/PLANTS10061036\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111149397; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q111149397; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/PLANTS10061036\",\"title\":\"A Comparative Review of Six Invasive Nassella Species in Australia with Implications for Their Management\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Two Nassella species, Nassella trichotoma and Nassella neesiana, have significantly reduced the carrying capacity of Australia\\u2019s south-east rangelands and agricultural systems. It is, therefore, of considerable concern that four other Nassella species have also become naturalised in Australia, and are noted to share many of the ecological features of the two currently widespread species. This paper reviews the distribution, ecology, and impacts of all six Nassella species, which are currently naturalised in Australia, and makes recommendations toward a blanket Nassella control program. The review highlights observed similarities between the species, including the time of flowering, seed type, germination requirements, and growth morphology. These common factors support the possibility that an integrated Nassella control program could be designed to integrate good grazing management with cultural control methods, such as soil cultivation, fire, and native plant competition, with treatments being implemented prior to the common annual seed maturation period. Notwithstanding the success of these integrated programs, it is recognised that seeds of all species may remain viable in the seedbank for up to 12 years, meaning ongoing monitoring and management will be required. To develop even finer control programs, further research into the ecology of these Nassella species is recommended to determine any additional weak spots in these species\\u2019 defences, and to subsequently develop and apply novel integrated control methods that target all six species.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021-05-24\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; Australia; invasion management\",\"subject\":\"Australia; invasion management\",\"authors\":\"Humphries, Talia; Florentine, Singarayer\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111149397\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8cb4606b3b57fee73b809d6d60bbdaf07aed3ce5eee90a5a5486b528d86f1b3a\",\"relevance\":107,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Humphries, Talia; Florentine, Singarayer\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.06347883031686e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77389491602864e-27\",\"labels\":\"8cb4606b3b57fee73b809d6d60bbdaf07aed3ce5eee90a5a5486b528d86f1b3a\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"905a015fdc3636ebff8daf5b7f211e3d66e16bd314df15ad5351493537dae157\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35653686; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35653686; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4457794; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0127575\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35653686; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35653686; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4457794; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0127575\",\"title\":\"Genetic Evidence of Hybridization between the Endangered Native Species Iguana delicatissima and the Invasive Iguana iguana (Reptilia, Iguanidae) in the Lesser Antilles: Management Implications\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The worldwide increase of hybridization in different groups is thought to have become more important with the loss of isolating barriers and the introduction of invasive species. This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investigating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive common green iguana (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been genotyped at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the implementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statistics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybridization patterns and introgression dynamics across the islands. The iguanas identified as hybrids in the wild, thanks to morphological analysis, were all genetically F1, F2, or backcrosses. A high proportion of individuals were also the result of a longer-term admixture. The absence of reproductive barriers between species leads to hybridization when species are in contact. Yet morphological and behavioral differences between species could explain why males I. iguana may dominate I. delicatissima, thus resulting in short-term species displacement and extinction by hybridization and recurrent introgression from I. iguana toward I. delicatissima.

Invasive species often co-occur in protected areas, represented by sparse, isolated individuals or populations in different stages in the process of invasion. Species invasiveness, habitat invasibility and impact also differ between ecosystems, so the risk of invasion varies. Besides, prioritization is required due to constraints on time, financial and other resources. Priority-setting is therefore key to help protected area managers invest efforts on biological invasions that offer the best chances of producing large-scale positive results at the lowest cost possible. A priority-setting scheme for the control of invasive non-native species in natural areas is presented in this paper. The scheme, based on field observations of species occurrences, was applied to the Itatiaia National Park (Brazil). Priorities are calculated from a combination of three criteria attributed to each occurrence: species risk of invasion considering local ecosystems, invasion stage, and species frequency. Data collected in the field in the Itatiaia National Park were used to calculate priorities for 50 non-native species (six animals and 44 plants) in four locations in the Park. The highest priorities were attributed to species of high risk in an early stage of invasion occurring in one site, whereas a few widespread species of low risk were given lower priority. The scheme has proven functional for setting priorities for the control of non-native species in the Itatiaia National Park and in many other protected areas in Brazil.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-10-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; aquatic science; prioritization; introduced species; invasion management\",\"subject\":\"aquatic science; prioritization; introduced species; invasion management\",\"authors\":\"Ziller, S\\u00edlvia R.; S\\u00e1 Dechoum, Michele; Silveira, Raphaela Aparecida Duarte; Rosa, Hugo Marques; Motta, Marcelo Souza; Silva, Leonardo Filipe; Oliveira, Beatriz Cunha Mello; Zenni, Rafael D.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q107461668\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"9108f532038d4f28a54c8fa00ba1726337f83902fb0caae261d9053d5b67331f\",\"relevance\":100,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Ziller, S\\u00edlvia R.; S\\u00e1 Dechoum, Michele; Silveira, Raphaela Aparecida Duarte; Rosa, Hugo Marques; Motta, Marcelo Souza; Silva, Leonardo Filipe; Oliveira, Beatriz Cunha Mello; Zenni, Rafael D.\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.06347413158644e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77385741731567e-27\",\"labels\":\"9108f532038d4f28a54c8fa00ba1726337f83902fb0caae261d9053d5b67331f\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"931d36e28e90a4df526b747bb03c672262202b1040350651e31bda906f07d332\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q107468699; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q107468699; doi:10.3897\\/NEOBIOTA.62.52793\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q107468699; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q107468699; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3897\\/NEOBIOTA.62.52793\",\"title\":\"The importance of assessing positive and beneficial impacts of alien species\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Extensive literature is available on the diversity and magnitude of impacts that alien species cause on recipient systems. Alien species may decrease or increase attributes of ecosystems (e.g. total biomass or species diversity), thus causing negative and positive environmental impacts. Alien species may also negatively or positively impact attributes linked to local human communities (e.g. the number of people involved in a given activity). Ethical and societal values contribute to define these environmental and socio-economic impacts as deleterious or beneficial. Whilst most of the literature focuses on the deleterious effects of alien taxa, some recognise their beneficial impacts on ecosystems and human activities. Impact assessment frameworks show a similar tendency to evaluate mainly deleterious impacts: only relatively few, and not widely applied, frameworks incorporate the beneficial impacts of alien species. Here, we provide a summary of the frameworks assessing beneficial impacts and briefly discuss why they might have been less frequently cited and applied than frameworks assessing exclusively deleterious impacts. Then, we review arguments that invoke a greater consideration of positive and beneficial impacts caused by alien species across the invasion science literature. We collate and describe arguments from a set of 47 papers, grouping them in two categories (value-free and value-laden), which span from a theoretical, basic science perspective to an applied science perspective. We also provide example cases associated with each argument. We advocate that the development of transparent and evidence-based frameworks assessing positive and beneficial impacts might advance our scientific understanding of impact dynamics and better inform management and prioritisation decisions. We also advise that this development should be achieved by recognising the underlying ethical and societal values of the frameworks and their intrinsic limitations.

Site and species characteristics (both plant and herbivore) must be considered when assessing the potential for herbivore damage, making it difficult to set thresholds for efficient management. Using the invasive brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula in New Zealand as a case study, we parameterized a generic model to predict annual probability of browse-induced mortality of five tree species at 12 sites. We compared predicted and observed tree mortality for each species_+_site combination to establish herbivore abundance - tree mortality thresholds for each site on a single and combined tree species basis. Model results indicated it is likely that possum browse was the primary cause of all tree mortality at nine of the 12 species-site combinations, allowing us to estimate site-specific thresholds below which possum population numbers should be reduced and maintained to keep tree mortality under a predetermined level, for example 0.5% per year. The browse model can be used to set site- and species-specific management action thresholds, and can be adapted easily for other plant or herbivore species. Results for multiple plant or herbivore species at a single site can be combined to create conservative, site-wide management strategies, and used to: determine which sites will be affected most by changes in herbivore abundance; quantify thresholds for herbivore management; and justify expenditure on herbivore control.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-04\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasion biology; invasive species; herbivory; herbivore; invasion impact; invasive herbivore\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; invasive species; herbivory; herbivore; invasion impact; invasive herbivore\",\"authors\":\"Holland, Pen; Gormley, Andrew M; Pech, Roger P\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q28603703\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"94ccfd369007c5a3a7256f28468ae84af8fe066e0f4ffe2f52811bfc18170574\",\"relevance\":66,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Holland, Pen; Gormley, Andrew M; Pech, Roger P\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12728711725319e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37655184916113e-27\",\"labels\":\"94ccfd369007c5a3a7256f28468ae84af8fe066e0f4ffe2f52811bfc18170574\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"955f109aa5d806688ea060412304c2d4d6a0b669b06869caba1f0d228b42cadb\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110626111; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q110626111; doi:10.3897\\/NEOBIOTA.55.49547\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110626111; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q110626111; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3897\\/NEOBIOTA.55.49547\",\"title\":\"On the RIP: using Relative Impact Potential to assess the ecological impacts of invasive alien species\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Invasive alien species continue to arrive in new locations with no abatement in rate, and thus greater predictive powers surrounding their ecological impacts are required. In particular, we need improved means of quantifying the ecological impacts of new invasive species under different contexts. Here, we develop a suite of metrics based upon the novel Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric, combining the functional response (consumer per capita effect), with proxies for the numerical response (consumer population response), providing quantification of invasive species ecological impact. These metrics are comparative in relation to the eco-evolutionary baseline of trophically analogous natives, as well as other invasive species and across multiple populations. Crucially, the metrics also reveal how impacts of invasive species change under abiotic and biotic contexts. While studies focused solely on functional responses have been successful in predictive invasion ecology, RIP retains these advantages while adding vital other predictive elements, principally consumer abundance. RIP can also be combined with propagule pressure to quantify overall invasion risk. By highlighting functional response and numerical response proxies, we outline a user-friendly method for assessing the impacts of invaders of all trophic levels and taxonomic groups. We apply the metric to impact assessment in the face of climate change by taking account of both changing predator consumption rates and prey reproduction rates. We proceed to outline the application of RIP to assess biotic resistance against incoming invasive species, the effect of evolution on invasive species impacts, application to interspecific competition, changing spatio-temporal patterns of invasion, and how RIP can inform biological control. We propose that RIP provides scientists and practitioners with a user-friendly, customisable and, crucially, powerful technique to inform invasive species policy and management.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-04-03\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasive species; invasion biology; introduced species; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"invasive species; invasion biology; introduced species; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Dickey, James W.

Here we tested how alterations in AMF community induced by an invasive plant species generate feedback to the invasive plant itself and affect subsequent interactions between the invasive species and its native neighbors. We first examined the effects of the invasive forb Solidago canadensis L. on AMF communities comprising five different AMF species. We then examined the effects of the altered AMF community on mutualisms formed with the native legume forb species Kummerowia striata (Thunb.) Schindl. and on the interaction between the invasive and native plants. The host preferences of the five AMF were also assessed to test whether the AMF form preferred mutualistic relations with the invasive and\\/or the native species. We found that S. canadensis altered AMF spore composition by increasing one AMF species (Glomus geosporum) while reducing Glomus mosseae, which is the dominant species in the field. The host preference test showed that S. canadensis had promoted the abundance of AMF species (G. geosporum) that most promoted its own growth. As a consequence, the altered AMF community enhanced the competitiveness of invasive S. canadensis at the expense of K. striata. Our results demonstrate that the invasive S. canadensis alters soil AMF community composition because of fungal-host preference. This change in the composition of the AMF community generates positive feedback to the invasive S. canadensis itself and decreases AM associations with native K. striata, thereby making the native K. striata less dominant.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2010-08-24\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; invasion biology; invasion success; mycorrhiza; plant invasion\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; invasion success; mycorrhiza; plant invasion\",\"authors\":\"Zhang, Qian; Yang, Ruyi; Tang, Jianjun; Yang, Haishui; Hu, Shuijin; Chen, Xin\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q33680098\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"9c3e67716d803cbaadbe37f58aa2de8c5e7f27d832d675245018b3e54d6c3c0b\",\"relevance\":36,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Zhang, Qian; Yang, Ruyi; Tang, Jianjun; Yang, Haishui; Hu, Shuijin; Chen, Xin\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55265253707859e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55090717168706e-27\",\"labels\":\"9c3e67716d803cbaadbe37f58aa2de8c5e7f27d832d675245018b3e54d6c3c0b\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"a1b031c09f3537a77714a9b2f89163dd3940459499ca3d71a6edf7db33af8989\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35866495; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35866495; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0144762\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35866495; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35866495; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0144762\",\"title\":\"Barcoding Techniques Help Tracking the Evolutionary History of the Introduced Species Pennaria disticha (Hydrozoa, Cnidaria)\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Christmas tree hydroid Pennaria disticha is listed as one of the most common introduced species in Hawaii. Firstly reported in Kaneohe Bay (Oahu) in 1928, it is now established throughout the entire archipelago, including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a U.S. National Monument and World Heritage site. The Hawaiian population of P. disticha has also been reported as being the source of further introductions to Palmyra Atoll in the U.S. Line Islands. Using a phylogenetic hypothesis based on a 611 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial 16S barcoding gene, we demonstrate that P. disticha is a complex of cryptic species, rather than one species with cosmopolitan distribution. We also show that in Hawaii there are three species of Pennaria, rather than one introduced species. Two of these species share haplotypes with specimens from distant locations such as Florida and Panama and may have been introduced, possibly from the Atlantic Ocean. A third species could either represent a lineage with nearly cosmopolitan distribution, or another introduced species. Our dataset refutes the widely accepted idea that only one lineage of P. disticha is present in Hawaii. On the contrary, P. disticha in Hawaii may be the outcome of multiple independent introductions of several morphologically undistinguishable cryptic lineages. Our results uncover an unsuspected complexity within the very common hydroid P. disticha, and highlight the need for routine use of molecular tools, such as DNA barcoding, to improve the identification and recognition of non-indigenous species.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2015-12-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; Cnidaria; introduced species; invasive species; invasion management\",\"subject\":\"Cnidaria; introduced species; invasive species; invasion management\",\"authors\":\"Miglietta, Maria Pia; Odegard, Dean; Faure, Baptiste; Faucci, Anuschka\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35866495\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a1b031c09f3537a77714a9b2f89163dd3940459499ca3d71a6edf7db33af8989\",\"relevance\":96,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Miglietta, Maria Pia; Odegard, Dean; Faure, Baptiste; Faucci, Anuschka\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.06346058089619e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77389923993096e-27\",\"labels\":\"a1b031c09f3537a77714a9b2f89163dd3940459499ca3d71a6edf7db33af8989\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"a5111ab1c765200157cb3be94957cc219e82f79a0531e4809e6fde59b489c45a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35813359; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35813359; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4723625; doi:10.1007\\/S00442-015-3472-6\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35813359; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35813359; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4723625; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/S00442-015-3472-6\",\"title\":\"Herbivory and dominance shifts among exotic and congeneric native plant species during plant community establishment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Invasive exotic plant species often have fewer natural enemies and suffer less damage from herbivores in their new range than genetically or functionally related species that are native to that area. Although we might expect that having fewer enemies would promote the invasiveness of the introduced exotic plant species due to reduced enemy exposure, few studies have actually analyzed the ecological consequences of this situation in the field. Here, we examined how exposure to aboveground herbivores influences shifts in dominance among exotic and phylogenetically related native plant species in a riparian ecosystem during early establishment of invaded communities. We planted ten plant communities each consisting of three individuals of each of six exotic plant species as well as six phylogenetically related natives. Exotic plant species were selected based on a rapid recent increase in regional abundance, the presence of a congeneric native species, and their co-occurrence in the riparian ecosystem. All plant communities were covered by tents with insect mesh. Five tents were open on the leeward side to allow herbivory. The other five tents were completely closed in order to exclude insects and vertebrates. Herbivory reduced aboveground biomass by half and influenced which of the plant species dominated the establishing communities. Exposure to herbivory did not reduce the total biomass of natives more than that of exotics, so aboveground herbivory did not selectively enhance exotics during this early stage of plant community development. Effects of herbivores on plant biomass depended on plant species or genus but not on plant status (i.e., exotic vs native). Thus, aboveground herbivory did not promote the dominance of exotic plant species during early establishment of the phylogenetically balanced plant communities.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2015-10-19\",\"subject_orig\":\"enemy release hypothesis; wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q85759287; hypothesis:enemy release hypothesis; hypothesis:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q85759287; theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; herbivory; invasion success\",\"subject\":\"enemy release hypothesis; herbivory; invasion success\",\"authors\":\"Engelkes, Tim; Meisner, Annelein; Morrien, Elly; Kostenko, Olga; Putten, Wim H.; Macel, Mirka\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35813359\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a5111ab1c765200157cb3be94957cc219e82f79a0531e4809e6fde59b489c45a\",\"relevance\":84,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Engelkes, Tim; Meisner, Annelein; Morrien, Elly; Kostenko, Olga; Putten, Wim H.; Macel, Mirka\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\",\"hypothesis\":\"enemy release hypothesis\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55349281071115e-28\",\"y\":\"5.5508788995005e-27\",\"labels\":\"a5111ab1c765200157cb3be94957cc219e82f79a0531e4809e6fde59b489c45a\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"a79bee434e2035957578ae37b8f116351802851d558949a05009dd8df7b5bfa0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110626041; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q110626041; doi:10.1007\\/S10530-021-02490-Y\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110626041; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q110626041; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/S10530-021-02490-Y\",\"title\":\"A novel approach to quantifying trophic interaction strengths and impact of invasive species in food webs\",\"paper_abstract\":\"AbstractMeasuring ecological and economic impacts of invasive species is necessary for managing invaded food webs. Based on abundance, biomass and diet data of autochthonous and allochthonous fish species, we proposed a novel approach to quantifying trophic interaction strengths in terms of number of individuals and biomass that each species subtract to the others in the food web. This allowed to estimate the economic loss associated to the impact of an invasive species on commercial fish stocks, as well as the resilience of invaded food webs to further perturbations. As case study, we measured the impact of the invasive bassMicropterus salmoidesin two lake communities differing in food web complexity and species richness, as well as the biotic resistance of autochthonous and allochthonous fish species against the invader. Resistance to the invader was higher, while its ecological and economic impact was lower, in the more complex and species-rich food web. The percidPerca fluviatilisand the whitefishCoregonus lavaretuswere the two species that most limited the invader, representing meaningful targets for conservation biological control strategies. In both food webs, the limiting effect of allochthonous species againstM. salmoideswas higher than the effect of autochthonous ones. Simulations predicted that the eradication of the invader would increase food web resilience, while that an increase in fish diversity would preserve resilience also at high abundances ofM. salmoides. Our results support the conservation of biodiverse food webs as a way to mitigate the impact of bass invasion in lake ecosystems. Notably, the proposed approach could be applied to any habitat and animal species whenever biomass and diet data can be obtained.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021-03-13\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasive species; food web; invasion impact; trophic interaction\",\"subject\":\"invasive species; food web; invasion impact; trophic interaction\",\"authors\":\"Calizza, Edoardo; Rossi, Loreto; Careddu, Giulio; Caputi, Simona Sporta; Costantini, Maria Letizia\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110626041\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a79bee434e2035957578ae37b8f116351802851d558949a05009dd8df7b5bfa0\",\"relevance\":94,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Calizza, Edoardo; Rossi, Loreto; Careddu, Giulio; Caputi, Simona Sporta; Costantini, Maria Letizia\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12721274738883e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37653796591912e-27\",\"labels\":\"a79bee434e2035957578ae37b8f116351802851d558949a05009dd8df7b5bfa0\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"aa93841531008f5f918b9d36c28f7399e283be5f61d405c288fdad872c10e753\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110663854; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q110663854; doi:10.3897\\/NEOBIOTA.70.68202\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110663854; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q110663854; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3897\\/NEOBIOTA.70.68202\",\"title\":\"_Management of invasive alien species in Spain: A bibliometric review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Scientific and grey literature on invasive alien species (IAS) is conditioned by social, economic and political priorities, editorial preferences and species and ecosystem characteristics. This leads to knowledge gaps and mismatches between scientific research interests and management needs. We reviewed the literature on IAS management in Spain found in Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Dialnet to identify key deficiencies and priority research areas. The collected literature was classified, employing features describing formal aspects and content. We used bibliometric and keyword co-occurrence network analyses to assess the relationship between features and reveal the existence of additional topics. Most of the compiled documents (n = 388) were focused on terrestrial ecosystems and inland waters, whereas marine and urban ecosystems were under-represented. The literature was largely generic and not species-specific, focusing on raising awareness and proposing changes on current regulation as prominent approaches to prevent further introductions. The compiled authors exhibited many clear publishing preferences (e.g. language or document type), but less regarding target taxa. In addition, there was a strong association between species and the different features considered, especially between the methodological approach (e.g. review, field experiment) and the primary emphasis of study (i.e. basic\\/theoretical, applied or interdisciplinary). This indicates that research on IAS has had a strong species-specific focus. References about terrestrial species focused mainly on vascular plants, whereas references about inland waters were mostly on fishes and the giant reed (Arundo donax), which has been managed with partial success. Animal culling and plant removal were the most frequent eradication and small-scale control treatments, whereas the documents addressing wider spatial scales were largely theoretical.

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Red List) categorises native species based on their risk of extinction. Such assessments evaluate the extent to which different pressures, including alien species, threaten native species. The much newer IUCN Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) categorises alien species on the degree to which they have impacted native species. Conceptually, the schemes are related. One would expect that: 1) if a native species is assessed as threatened under the Red List due to the impacts of alien species, then at least one alien species involved should be classified as harmful under EICAT; and 2) if an alien species is assessed as harmful under EICAT, then at least one native species impacted should be assessed as threatened by alien species under the Red List.

We found a weak positive correlation, but it is clear there is not a simple one-to-one relationship.

Introduction: There is a large information gap on the occurrence of non-native species and their impacts on native biodiversity in the Amazon region in Brazil. Objective: The objective of this study was to characterize the floristic composition of a protected area in Manaus, Amazonas, and assess the potential impact of non-native invasive species. Methods: A floristic survey was carried out in 30 plots measuring 20 x 20 m with 1 x 1 m subplots. The estimated parameters were density, frequency, dominance, Importance Value Index (IVI), and Environmental Impact of Non-Native Species (IIAE). Results: In total, 8 out of 264 species registered in the tree-shrub layer were not native. A total of 61 species were identified in the herbaceous layer, five of which were non-native. The impact is estimated based on the highest abundance of species of non-native species. Conclusions: The presence of non-native species in the study area is an indication of a potential impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functions.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-07-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; introduced species; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"introduced species; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Magalh\\u00e3es, Lana Cynthia Silva; Ziller, Silvia Renate; Silva-Forsberg, Maria Clara\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110757051\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b2bd476b56bcccc9dbade5ac19d13e4084f8c0086796ea3cd3b81ea5c7ad2693\",\"relevance\":105,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Magalh\\u00e3es, Lana Cynthia Silva; Ziller, Silvia Renate; Silva-Forsberg, Maria Clara\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12725275831694e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37651426452385e-27\",\"labels\":\"b2bd476b56bcccc9dbade5ac19d13e4084f8c0086796ea3cd3b81ea5c7ad2693\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"b4f345651f289cca04411ba6e8eba1c66cb5aa529df1829759d477627f861a3d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34850358; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q34850358; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC3706395; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0068678\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34850358; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q34850358; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC3706395; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0068678\",\"title\":\"Are high-impact species predictable? An analysis of naturalised grasses in northern Australia\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Predicting which species are likely to cause serious impacts in the future is crucial for targeting management efforts, but the characteristics of such species remain largely unconfirmed. We use data and expert opinion on tropical and subtropical grasses naturalised in Australia since European settlement to identify naturalised and high-impact species and subsequently to test whether high-impact species are predictable. High-impact species for the three main affected sectors (environment, pastoral and agriculture) were determined by assessing evidence against pre-defined criteria. Twenty-one of the 155 naturalised species (14%) were classified as high-impact, including four that affected more than one sector. High-impact species were more likely to have faster spread rates (regions invaded per decade) and to be semi-aquatic. Spread rate was best explained by whether species had been actively spread (as pasture), and time since naturalisation, but may not be explanatory as it was tightly correlated with range size and incidence rate. Giving more weight to minimising the chance of overlooking high-impact species, a priority for biosecurity, meant a wider range of predictors was required to identify high-impact species, and the predictive power of the models was reduced. By-sector analysis of predictors of high impact species was limited by their relative rarity, but showed sector differences, including to the universal predictors (spread rate and habitat) and life history. Furthermore, species causing high impact to agriculture have changed in the past 10 years with changes in farming practice, highlighting the importance of context in determining impact. A rationale for invasion ecology is to improve the prediction and response to future threats. Although our study identifies some universal predictors, it suggests improved prediction will require a far greater emphasis on impact rather than invasiveness, and will need to account for the individual circumstances of affected sectors and the relative rarity of ...\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-07-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; Australia; naturalization; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"Australia; naturalization; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Klinken, Rieks D; Panetta, F Dane; Coutts, Shaun R\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q34850358\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b4f345651f289cca04411ba6e8eba1c66cb5aa529df1829759d477627f861a3d\",\"relevance\":98,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Klinken, Rieks D; Panetta, F Dane; Coutts, Shaun R\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12726324128399e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37655044373642e-27\",\"labels\":\"b4f345651f289cca04411ba6e8eba1c66cb5aa529df1829759d477627f861a3d\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"b9ef7fe325f55dc9aeae3f673fe2b4e444011f9dd568a030c1b08e5a69f9ad72\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q30571682; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q30571682; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC3447880; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0045400\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q30571682; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q30571682; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC3447880; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0045400\",\"title\":\"Interaction of species traits and environmental disturbance predicts invasion success of aquatic microorganisms\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Factors such as increased mobility of humans, global trade and climate change are affecting the range of many species, and cause large-scale translocations of species beyond their native range. Many introduced species have a strong negative influence on the new local environment and lead to high economic costs. There is a strong interest to understand why some species are successful in invading new environments and others not. Most of our understanding and generalizations thereof, however, are based on studies of plants and animals, and little is known on invasion processes of microorganisms. We conducted a microcosm experiment to understand factors promoting the success of biological invasions of aquatic microorganisms. In a controlled lab experiment, protist and rotifer species originally isolated in North America invaded into a natural, field-collected community of microorganisms of European origin. To identify the importance of environmental disturbances on invasion success, we either repeatedly disturbed the local patches, or kept them as undisturbed controls. We measured both short-term establishment and long-term invasion success, and correlated it with species-specific life-history traits. We found that environmental disturbances significantly affected invasion success. Depending on the invading species' identity, disturbances were either promoting or decreasing invasion success. The interaction between habitat disturbance and species identity was especially pronounced for long-term invasion success. Growth rate was the most important trait promoting invasion success, especially when the species invaded into a disturbed local community. We conclude that neither species traits nor environmental factors alone conclusively predict invasion success, but an integration of both of them is necessary.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2012-09-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; invasion biology; invasive species; invasion success; aquatic invasion; invasion success prediction\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; invasive species; invasion success; aquatic invasion; invasion success prediction\",\"authors\":\"M\\u00e4chler, Elvira; Altermatt, Florian\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q30571682\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b9ef7fe325f55dc9aeae3f673fe2b4e444011f9dd568a030c1b08e5a69f9ad72\",\"relevance\":93,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"M\\u00e4chler, Elvira; Altermatt, Florian\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55241190610801e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55089939258287e-27\",\"labels\":\"b9ef7fe325f55dc9aeae3f673fe2b4e444011f9dd568a030c1b08e5a69f9ad72\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"},{\"id\":\"ba5e25ae9d05ee048a17ad73a238bf0e03402719498634bb7e9b36b3bd6f5443\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q28731546; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q28731546; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC3293794; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0032407\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q28731546; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q28731546; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC3293794; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0032407\",\"title\":\"A battle lost? Report on two centuries of invasion and management of Lantana camara L. in Australia, India and South Africa\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Recent discussion on invasive species has invigorated the debate on strategies to manage these species. Lantana camara L., a shrub native to the American tropics, has become one of the worst weeds in recorded history. In Australia, India and South Africa, Lantana has become very widespread occupying millions of hectares of land. Here, we examine historical records to reconstruct invasion and management of Lantana over two centuries and ask: Can we fight the spread of invasive species or do we need to develop strategies for their adaptive management? We carried out extensive research of historical records constituting over 75% of records on invasion and management of this species in the three countries. The records indicate that governments in Australia, India and South Africa have taken aggressive measures to eradicate Lantana over the last two centuries, but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful. We found that despite control measures, the invasion trajectory of Lantana has continued upwards and that post-war land-use change might have been a possible trigger for this spread. A large majority of studies on invasive species address timescales of less than one year; and even fewer address timescales of >10 years. An understanding of species invasions over long time-scales is of paramount importance. While archival records may give only a partial picture of the spread and management of invasive species, in the absence of any other long-term dataset on the ecology of Lantana, our study provides an important insight into its invasion, spread and management over two centuries and across three continents. While the established paradigm is to expend available resources on attempting to eradicate invasive species, our findings suggest that in the future, conservationists will need to develop strategies for their adaptive management rather than fighting a losing battle.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2012\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion management; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113019190; South Africa; India; Australia; Lantana camara; invasive species; invasion management; invasive plant\",\"subject\":\"South Africa; India; Australia; Lantana camara; invasive species; invasion management; invasive plant\",\"authors\":\"Bhagwat, Shonil A; Breman, Elinor; Thekaekara, Tarsh; Thornton, Thomas F; Willis, Katherine J\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q28731546\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ba5e25ae9d05ee048a17ad73a238bf0e03402719498634bb7e9b36b3bd6f5443\",\"relevance\":24,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Bhagwat, Shonil A; Breman, Elinor; Thekaekara, Tarsh; Thornton, Thomas F; Willis, Katherine J\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion management\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion management\",\"x\":\"4.06345304595704e-27\",\"y\":\"-2.77389526744537e-27\",\"labels\":\"ba5e25ae9d05ee048a17ad73a238bf0e03402719498634bb7e9b36b3bd6f5443\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Invasion management\"},{\"id\":\"bffcfeba314aeaf4ed15940880fd6b415ed44d7d57f2ff690c560571d71afc91\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35908440; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35908440; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4732764; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0147826\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35908440; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35908440; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4732764; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0147826\",\"title\":\"Non-Native Plant Invasion along Elevation and Canopy Closure Gradients in a Middle Rocky Mountain Ecosystem\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Mountain environments are currently among the ecosystems least invaded by non-native species; however, mountains are increasingly under threat of non-native plant invasion. The slow pace of exotic plant invasions in mountain ecosystems is likely due to a combination of low anthropogenic disturbances, low propagule supply, and extreme\\/steep environmental gradients. The importance of any one of these factors is debated and likely ecosystem dependent. We evaluated the importance of various correlates of plant invasions in the Wallowa Mountain Range of northeastern Oregon and explored whether non-native species distributions differed from native species along an elevation gradient. Vascular plant communities were sampled in summer 2012 along three mountain roads. Transects (n = 20) were evenly stratified by elevation (~70 m intervals) along each road. Vascular plant species abundances and environmental parameters were measured. We used indicator species analysis to identify habitat affinities for non-native species. Plots were ordinated in species space, joint plots and non-parametric multiplicative regression were used to relate species and community variation to environmental variables. Non-native species richness decreased continuously with increasing elevation. In contrast, native species richness displayed a unimodal distribution with maximum richness occurring at mid-elevations. Species composition was strongly related to elevation and canopy openness. Overlays of trait and environmental factors onto non-metric multidimensional ordinations identified the montane-subalpine community transition and over-story canopy closure exceeding 60% as potential barriers to non-native species establishment. Unlike native species, non-native species showed little evidence for high-elevation or closed-canopy specialization. These data suggest that non-native plants currently found in the Wallowa Mountains are dependent on open canopies and disturbance for establishment in low and mid elevations.

In Chile, the species has been observed around 30\\u00b0S of latitude, but no official reports exist for the presence ofC. intestinalisin southern regions (above 40\\u00b0S), where most of the mollusk aquaculture centers are located. Here, we used occurrences from multiple invaded regions and extensive field sampling to model and validate the environmental conditions that allow the species to persist and to find the geographic areas with the most suitable environmental conditions for the spread ofC. intestinalisin the Chilean coast. By studying the potential expansion ofC. intestinalissouthward in the Chilean Coast, we aimed to provide valuable information that might help the development of control plans before the species becomes a significant problem, especially above 40\\u00b0S. Our results highlight that, by using portions of the habitat that are apparently distinguishable, the species seem to be not only genetically distinct, but ecologically distinct as well. The two regional models fitted for sp A and for sp B showed disagreement on which sections of Chilean coastline are considered more suitable for these species.

We find that the predictions for the impacts of invasive species are ecologically plausible, even in large networks. Species in the same taxonomic group are similarly impacted by a virtual invasive species. However, interesting differences within a given taxonomic group can occur.

Of the 15 species assessed, the three terrestrial invasive plant species that could pose the greatest threat to Alberta's biodiversity are giant knotweed (Fallopia sachalinensis), tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis), and alkali swainsonpea (Sphaerophysa salsula).

This mixture produced biomass rapidly and showed tolerance to weed species other than parthenium weed. However, the mixture was unable to suppress the growth of parthenium weed. The second mixture of predominantly native pasture species (including forest bluegrass, Queensland bluegrass, Buffel grass and siratro) produced biomass relatively slowly, but eventually reached the same biomass production as the first mixture 12 weeks after planting. This mixture suppressed parthenium weed re-establishment by 78% compared to the control treatment. Its tolerance to the invasion of other weed species and the maintenance of forage species evenness was also superior.

Tourism and outdoor recreation involve the frequent congregation of people, vehicles and vessels from geographically diverse areas. They are therefore perceived to be major pathways for the movement of non-native species, and ones that will become increasingly important with the continued growth of these sectors. However, a global assessment of the relationship between tourism activities and the introduction of non-native species-particularly in freshwater and marine environments-is lacking. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of tourism and outdoor recreation on non-native species in terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments. Our results provide quantitative evidence that the abundance and richness of non-native species are significantly higher in sites where tourist activities take place than in control sites. The pattern was consistent across terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments; across a variety of vectors (e.g. horses, hikers, yachts); and across a range of taxonomic groups.

Here we aimed to determine if the recent range expansion of Bactrocera invadens into southern Africa can be better understood through niche exploration tools, ecological niche models (ENMs), and through incorporating information about Bactrocera dorsalis s.s., a putative conspecific species from Asia. We test for niche overlap of environmental variables between Bactrocera invadens and Bactrocera dorsalis s.s. as well as two other putative conspecific species, Bactrocera philippinensis and B. papayae. We examine overlap and similarity in the geographical expression of each species' realised niche through reciprocal distribution models between Africa and Asia. We explore different geographical backgrounds, environmental variables and model complexity with multiple and single Bactrocera species hypotheses in an attempt to predict the recent range expansion of B. invadens into northern parts of South Africa.Principal findingsBactrocera invadens has a high degree of niche overlap with B. dorsalis s.s. (and B. philippinensis and B. papayae). Ecological niche models built for Bactrocera dorsalis s.s. have high transferability to describe the range of B. invadens, and B. invadens is able to project to the core range of B. dorsalis s.s. The ENMs of both Bactrocera dorsalis and B. dorsalis combined with B. philipenesis and B. papayae have significantly higher predictive ability to capture the distribution points in South Africa than for B. invadens alone.Conclusions\\/significanceConsistent with other studies proposing these Bactrocera species as conspecific, niche similarity and overlap between these species is high.

Here, we explored the FRs of two land snails that occur in south-western Ontario, one native (Mesodonthyroidus) and one non-indigenous (Cepaeanemoralis) to Canada. The non-indigenous species appears to have low ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities. Consistent with theory, while both species conformed to Type II functional responses, the native species had a significantly higher attack rate (5.30 vs 0.41, respectively) and slightly lower handling time (0.020 vs 0.023), and hence a higher maximum feeding rate (50.0 vs 43.5). The non-indigenous species exhibited a significantly longer time to contact for a variety of food types, and appeared less discriminating of paper that was offered as a non-food type. The non-indigenous species also ate significantly less food when in mixed species trials with the native snail. These feeding patterns match the known low ecological impact of the introduced snail and are consistent with the view that it is an inferior competitor relative to the native species. However, field experimentation is required to clarify whether the largely microallopatric distributions of the two species in south-western Ontario reflect competitive dominance by the native species or other factors such as habitat preference, feeding preferences or predator avoidance. The relative patterns of feeding behaviour and ecological impact are, however, fully in line with recent functional response theory and application.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-06-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Hoxha, Tedi; Crookes, Steve; MacIsaac, Ian; Chang, Xuexiu; Johansson, Mattias; Dick, Jaimie T.A.; Nicolai, Annegret; MacIsaac, Hugh J.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q110625932\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ea3bae4be32f2e97cd729f9f0835b6bc24ffc232b8ac988d17167c88cc299842\",\"relevance\":61,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Hoxha, Tedi; Crookes, Steve; MacIsaac, Ian; Chang, Xuexiu; Johansson, Mattias; Dick, Jaimie T.A.; Nicolai, Annegret; MacIsaac, Hugh J.\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12723037204245e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37650925090301e-27\",\"labels\":\"ea3bae4be32f2e97cd729f9f0835b6bc24ffc232b8ac988d17167c88cc299842\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"eb74b0ad41f5b1a393720323387239dcd96d6aba8bd448dc9b79f7bb23f3e426\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111153007; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q111153007; doi:10.3390\\/F9090567\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111153007; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q111153007; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/F9090567\",\"title\":\"Native Plant Diversity and Composition Across a Pinus radiata D.Don Plantation Landscape in South-Central Chile\\u2014The Impact of Plantation Age, Logging Roads and Alien Species\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Alien tree plantations are expanding globally with potential negative effects for native biodiversity. We investigated plant species diversity and composition in a Pinus radiata landscape in south-central Chile, a biodiversity hotspot, by sampling understory vegetation in different plantation age classes, along forest roads and in natural forest remnants in order to find effective conservation measures for native biodiversity. Plantations, including different age classes and roadsides, maintained high native species richness at the landscape scale but supported a completely different community composition than natural forests. Thus, natural forest remnants must be conserved as plantations cannot replace them. Certain natural forest species occurred frequently in mature plantations and can represent starting points for retaining natural elements in plantations. Generalist native and alien species benefited from plantation management, mainly in young plantations and along roadsides. Stand maturation and a closed canopy, though, reduced alien species occurrences within plantations. Along roads, shade-tolerant aliens should be monitored and removed as they can potentially invade natural forests. Native species conservation in plantations requires a holistic approach of the full mosaic of land uses including the protection of remaining natural forests, alien species monitoring along roadsides and patches with continuous canopy cover to reduce pressure by alien species.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-09-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; Pinus radiata; introduced species; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"Pinus radiata; introduced species; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Heinrichs, Steffi; Pauchard, An\\u00edbal; Schall, Peter\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q111153007\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"eb74b0ad41f5b1a393720323387239dcd96d6aba8bd448dc9b79f7bb23f3e426\",\"relevance\":104,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Heinrichs, Steffi; Pauchard, An\\u00edbal; Schall, Peter\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12726453899356e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.37653141037427e-27\",\"labels\":\"eb74b0ad41f5b1a393720323387239dcd96d6aba8bd448dc9b79f7bb23f3e426\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"ee288922cd2887b1349b8d37f2b1ba46181421f55f58072f3d38142df03580a0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q113692831; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113692831; doi:10.3897\\/BISS.6.93879\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q113692831; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q113692831; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3897\\/BISS.6.93879\",\"title\":\"LIFE RIPARIAS Early Alert: Using GBIF-mediated data to better manage invasive alien species\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Invasive alien species represent one of the major threats to biodiversity. Prevention is better than cure, but once invasive species get established, early management interventions are important to prevent further damage to nature and increasing management costs. Managers need to be informed as swiftly as possible when invasive species pop up in their area. Moreover, an effective response also requires information on species in neighbouring areas. This way, managers can anticipate recolonisation and coordinate the response across higher spatial scales. Open data are indispensible to efficiently organize such early detection of and rapid response to invasive species. Here, we present LIFE RIPARIAS Early Alert, a new open source tool that aggregates data from diverse sources and sends tailored e-mail alerts to managers. The tool focusses on the project area of the EU co-funded project LIFE RIPARIAS (Reaching Integrated and Prompt Action in Response to Invasive Alien Species, LIFE19 NAT\\/BE\\/000953), which aims to improve dataflows for the management of invasive alien species in river basins across regional administrative borders in Belgium. Data on invasive alien species in Belgium are scattered across a multitude of sources, including project surveys, official monitoring schemes, scientific projects and citizen science reporting portals. We facilitated the standardization and publication of these sources as open datasets to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The early alert tool then harvests these observations from GBIF, visualizes them on a map as well as in table view, with their exact coordinates and a link to the original record. The tool allows for date range filtering and the selection of newly reported (and published) observations through a simple intuitive user interface.

Invasive species Solidago canadensis as well as all the other invasive species in general poses a threat especially in the protected landscape areas such as Poodri PLA thanks to disrupting their natural ecosystems and reducing their exceptional biodiversity. Solidago canadensis can achieve those goals mainly thanks to the ability of quick propagation not only sexual one by seeds, but also asexual (vegetative) by rhizomes and thanks to releasing allelopathic substances which has negative impact on other plant species for example inhibition of their germination and growth. By these means it relatively quickly sets up monodominant covers, displaces original and rare plant species and poses threat to further development of the landscape of Poodri PLA.

Comparing current to historical records revealed 18 extirpations of native plant species (32% of species historically present), 31 exotic species introductions, and one case of exotic introduction followed by extirpation. Contemporary surveys indicated that native species cover declined dramatically from 1986 to 2006, coincident with the extirpation of \\u2018old-growth\\u2019 conifers. Because vegetation change co-occurred with an increasing gull population locally and regionally, we tested several predictions from the hypothesis that the presence and activities of seabirds help to explain those changes. Specifically, we predicted that on Mandarte and nearby islands with gull colonies, we should observe higher nutrient loading and exotic plant species richness and cover than on nearby islands without gull colonies, as a consequence of competitive dominance in species adapted to high soil nitrogen and trampling. As predicted, we found that native plant species cover and richness were lower, and exotic species cover and richness higher, on islands with versus without gull colonies. In addition, we found that soil carbon and nitrogen on islands with nesting gulls were positively related to soil depth and exotic species richness and cover across plots and islands. Our results support earlier suggestions that nesting seabirds can drive rapid change in insular plant communities by increasing nutrients and disturbing vegetation, and that human activities that affect seabird abundance may therefore indirectly affect plant community composition on islands with seabird colonies.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-07-21\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion impact; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q112148709; ecosystem; seabird; invasion biology; invasive species; ecosystem change; invasion impact\",\"subject\":\"ecosystem; seabird; invasion biology; invasive species; ecosystem change; invasion impact\",\"authors\":\"Lameris, Thomas K; Bennett, Joseph R.; Blight, Louise K; Giesen, Marissa; Janssen, Michael H; Schamin\\u00e9e, Joop J H J; Arcese, Peter\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q31122777\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"f7d304e55b62117d3c8b0167236d62074afb1593e0d0b7c4ecd8b44b8c006dc1\",\"relevance\":86,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Lameris, Thomas K; Bennett, Joseph R.; Blight, Louise K; Giesen, Marissa; Janssen, Michael H; Schamin\\u00e9e, Joop J H J; Arcese, Peter\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion impact\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion impact\",\"x\":\"-4.12727496054199e-27\",\"y\":\"-1.376560920263e-27\",\"labels\":\"f7d304e55b62117d3c8b0167236d62074afb1593e0d0b7c4ecd8b44b8c006dc1\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Invasion impact\"},{\"id\":\"ff1b0e33044a62bf4dd5c8e3f35eea41433e1f3d0c437752090f2310622ebfcf\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35838015; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35838015; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4640883; doi:10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0141559\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35838015; http:\\/\\/www.wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q35838015; https:\\/\\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\\/pmc\\/articles\\/PMC4640883; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/JOURNAL.PONE.0141559\",\"title\":\"Sampling and Complementarity Effects of Plant Diversity on Resource Use Increases the Invasion Resistance of Communities\",\"paper_abstract\":\"BackgroundAlthough plant diversity is postulated to resist invasion, studies have not provided consistent results, most of which were ascribed to the influences of other covariate environmental factors.Methodology\\/principal findingsTo explore the mechanisms by which plant diversity influences community invasibility, an experiment was conducted involving grassland sites varying in their species richness (one, two, four, eight, and sixteen species). Light interception efficiency and soil resources (total N, total P, and water content) were measured. The number of species, biomass, and the number of seedlings of the invading species decreased significantly with species richness. The presence of Patrinia scabiosaefolia Fisch. ex Trev. and Mosla dianthera (Buch.-Ham. ex Roxburgh) Maxim. significantly increased the resistance of the communities to invasion. A structural equation model showed that the richness of planted species had no direct and significant effect on invasion. Light interception efficiency had a negative effect on the invasion whereas soil water content had a positive effect. In monocultures, Antenoron filiforme (Thunb.) Rob. et Vaut. showed the highest light interception efficiency and P. scabiosaefolia recorded the lowest soil water content. With increased planted-species richness, a greater percentage of pots showed light use efficiency higher than that of A. filiforme and a lower soil water content than that in P. scabiosaefolia.Conclusions\\/significanceThe results of this study suggest that plant diversity confers resistance to invasion, which is mainly ascribed to the sampling effect of particular species and the complementarity effect among species on resources use.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2015-11-10\",\"subject_orig\":\"theme:invasion success; theme:wikidata.org\\/entity\\/Q109467185; invasion biology; biodiversity; invasion resistance; invasion success\",\"subject\":\"invasion biology; biodiversity; invasion resistance; invasion success\",\"authors\":\"Zhu, Dan H; Wang, Ping; Zhang, Wei Z; Yuan, Yue; Li, Bin; Wang, Jiang\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholia.toolforge.org\\/work\\/Q35838015\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ff1b0e33044a62bf4dd5c8e3f35eea41433e1f3d0c437752090f2310622ebfcf\",\"relevance\":33,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"dctype\":\"journal article\",\"dctypenorm\":\"121\",\"doi\":\"\",\"dclang\":\"eng\",\"dclanguage\":\"en\",\"content_provider\":\"enKORE project\",\"dccoverage\":\"\",\"is_duplicate\":false,\"has_dataset\":false,\"sanitized_authors\":\"Zhu, Dan H; Wang, Ping; Zhang, Wei Z; Yuan, Yue; Li, Bin; Wang, Jiang\",\"annotations\":{\"theme\":\"invasion success\"},\"repo\":\"ftenkore\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Invasion success\",\"x\":\"1.55350005760542e-28\",\"y\":\"5.55089054276552e-27\",\"labels\":\"ff1b0e33044a62bf4dd5c8e3f35eea41433e1f3d0c437752090f2310622ebfcf\",\"area_uri\":4,\"area\":\"Invasion success\"}]"
