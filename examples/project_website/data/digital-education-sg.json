In Lithuania, before the COVID-19 pandemic, distance education in preschool education, which is meant to prepare a child for school, was not applied, there were no specific guidelines, tested teaching platforms or pedagogic practices. The study deals with the results of focus groups research performed in June 2020, designated for discussing of experiences of the Lithuanian preschool education institutions in distance education gained during the quarantine (from 16\\/03\\/2020 to 29\\/05\\/2020). The performed analysis of experiences in the organisation of distant education in preschool education disclosed the essential challenges faced when applying this form of education in the education of six-year-old children. It has been established that the key challenges organizing distance education in preschool education are related to the lack of the IT solutions for distance education; the readiness of the participants of the education process for distance education and engagement in suchprocess of education, as well as the lack of support from national and regional institutions in the organisation of distance education. The results of research open possibilities for further researches, which are necessary for efficient and sustainable distance education integration into preschool education. In this context, explicit, deep research related to the analysis of appropriateness of distance education platforms in the early stage of age, search for didactic solutions of digital content for them and deep research into concrete implementation cases is necessary.\",\"published_in\":\"Digital Education Review; No 40 (2021); 141-153 ; Digital Education Review; No. 40 (2021): Number 40, December 2021; 141-153 ; Digital Education Review; N\\u00fam. 40 (2021): N\\u00famero 40, diciembre 2021; 141-153 ; 2013-9144\",\"year\":\"2021-12-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"Preschool education; organisation of education; distance education; COVID-19\",\"subject\":\"Preschool education; organisation of education; distance education; \",\"authors\":\"Railien\\u0117, Asta; Merfeldaite, Odeta; Prakapas, Romas\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/revistes.ub.edu\\/index.php\\/der\\/article\\/view\\/32971\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"1139076037b91cd4a577353b4e6f0250053b6c16d63f47728a271851554e5890\",\"relevance\":467,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2ac33f3c2c463cc8a18ee244aa3d79073a310097800cc1eefad4e578a22efb4c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/repl.gianfj.com\\/index.php\\/jldhe\\/article\\/view\\/489; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1759-667X; doi:10.47408\\/jldhe.v0i14.489; 1759-667X; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/27bfab4308a74f018de2586176faf170\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.47408\\/jldhe.v0i14.489; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/27bfab4308a74f018de2586176faf170\",\"title\":\"Making use of students' digital habits in higher education: What they already know and what they learn\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Varieties of digital practices have increasingly become part of people\\u2019s everyday lives and people, in general, use these communicative practices on a daily basis, mostly for social and entertaining purposes. As to higher education, researchers have pointed out that digital technology could be a useful tool in how to learn more effectively, if it is based on the abilities that students bring with them into higher education from their everyday life (for example, Buzzard et. al., 2011). In this case study, we explore the issue of students' digital practices in everyday life as well as in higher education, in a teacher training programme at a Swedish University. The aim is two-fold: on the one hand, to provide knowledge regarding students' everyday experiences of digital practices and the ways in which these are utilised in higher education; on the other hand, to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which higher education contributes to challenging and developing students' digital skills. Twenty-nine students from teacher training programmes participated in the study by answering a questionnaire. The results show that the students\\u2019 digital habits are not being used or acknowledged in higher education, except for when it comes to their Teacher Training Practice (TTP). Furthermore, the results also show that higher education contributes to students\\u2019 digital skills. This, we argue, could be of interest for teachers and researchers in teacher training programmes and for teachers in primary to tertiary education, in developing education activities with digital technology based on pupils\\u2019 and students\\u2019 digital habits. We can also see that the study can inspire other teachers in higher education, where the idea of using students\\u2019 digital habits perhaps is not yet taken into consideration.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Learning Development in Higher Education, Iss 14 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital technology; higher education; teacher training practice; digital habits; digital skills; digital environment; Theory and practice of education; LB5-3640\",\"subject\":\"digital technology; higher education; teacher training practice; digital habits; digital skills; digital environment; Theory and practice of education; \",\"authors\":\"Eva Hansson; Jeanette Sj\\u00f6berg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.47408\\/jldhe.v0i14.489\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"2ac33f3c2c463cc8a18ee244aa3d79073a310097800cc1eefad4e578a22efb4c\",\"relevance\":466,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.47408\\/jldhe.v0i14.489\"},{\"id\":\"4ea7c4cb485aed83ecdbb20cc0e991bcd30ccdc51c3f80789c7bc4b9ee796818\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/communities\\/paee-ale; https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.5095070; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/communities\\/paee-ale\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.5095069; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/5095069\",\"title\":\"Management of digital transformation of educational technology: key elements\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The aim of this paper is to provide insight into the key elements of management of digital transformation of educational technology and to suggest avenues for future study.

Although scholars have highlighted the importance of students' digital informal learning in developing their digital competence, the mediating role of digital informal learning between digital competence and academic performance have remained unexplored. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the mediating role of digital informal learning between higher education students' digital competence and their academic performance. The data were collected from 319 students from Shiraz University in Iran. Data were analysed using structural equation modeling via AMOS. The result showed a positive effect of the students' digital competence on their digital informal learning and academic performance. Moreover, digital informal learning as the mediator variable had a positive effect on the relationship between digital competence and students' academic performance.

Educating them and bringing them into society is one of the most fundamental tasks of a nation. The disadvantageous position that individuals with a disability are exposed to shows the importance of the need for inclusive education for the quality of life. It is important to use the merits of digital transformation to provide services and education for all to support sustainability. This research aims to shine a light on the problems related to inclusive education faced in the special education schools and rehabilitation centers and put forward suggestions for digital transformation. As inclusive means inclusion, social interaction, access, and equality for education, the role of digital transformation is examined for the quality of inclusive education. Self-reflection is a qualitative form which was employed in the research involving school managers and teachers who were selected randomly from the Special Education Schools and Rehabilitation Centers that participated in the research. It is revealed that most of the studies focus on inclusive education, the digital divide, social inclusion, online learning, and the implication of inclusive education in digital transformation. Although studies expose inclusive education in digital transformation, most of these have 0.20 quality criteria, showing an intensified need to extend the existing body of knowledge. It is shown that the vast majority of inclusive education aligns with the institution\\u2019s inclusive education vision and purpose. Concerning financing, it is difficult to find sponsors among non-governmental organizations to support the institution\\u2019s inclusive education-related material, equipment, and security needs, and Ministry of National Education funding is essential. There is a need to improve the inclusive education competencies of administrators and teachers, and in-service training should be provided. Self-improvement opportunities of administrators and teachers of the institution are significantly inadequate and should be improved.\",\"published_in\":\"Electronics, Vol 11, Iss 585, p 585 (2022)\",\"year\":\"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital transformation; inclusive education; special education; education management; sustainable management; policy development; Electronics; TK7800-8360\",\"subject\":\"digital transformation; inclusive education; special education; education management; sustainable management; policy development; Electronics; \",\"authors\":\"Refia Ari; Zehra Altinay; Fahriye Altinay; Gokmen Dagli; Engin Ari\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/electronics11040585\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"d9867beba11d5ecb899fb0ea9551dc97b1a482a6636c14da107839afa960765e\",\"relevance\":436,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/electronics11040585\"},{\"id\":\"08e8c980f24fd49ebdd2cb56ef6b7ffb0263d207901fdaac787e2c65a52aba34\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/155846; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/tojde\\/issue\\/16897\\/176081\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/tojde\\/issue\\/16897\\/176081\",\"title\":\"Digital \\u201cTsunami\\u201d in Higher Education: Democratisation Movement Towards Open And Free Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The result of the digital \\u201cTsunami\\u201d changes in education in the 21st has been huge.

Recent reflections of these changes over citizenship studies are noteworthy. One of the relevant concepts, digital citizenship can be defined as applying and advocating behaviors necessary for legal, ethical, safe, and responsible use of info-communication technologies in online settings (ISTE, 2007). Day by day, individuals are becoming more and more digital citizens with the spread of the Internet and digital communication devices. However, this gives rise to discussions about problems related with ethics, privacy and security, health, communication, and etc. (Symantec, 2010; Deniz, 2010; Kadll, Kumba & Kanamad, 2010; Gunduz & Ozdinc, 2008; Kabakci & Can, 2009). All these hot issues, debates, and current technological competence standards point that teachers should teach this concept to their students as efficiently as possible by adopting digital citizenship (Greenhow, 2010). Ribble (2006) states that this education can be carried out through 9 dimensions such as digital ethics, digital communication, digital literacy, digital access, digital commerce, digital rights and law, digital privacy and security, digital responsibility, and digital health & wellness.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Social Studies Education Research, Vol 5, Iss 1, Pp 38-78 (2014)\",\"year\":\"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital citizenship; Social studies course; Citizenship education; Education (General); L7-991; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"Digital citizenship; Social studies course; Citizenship education; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"H\\u0131d\\u0131r KARADUMAN; Cemil Ozt\\u00fcrk\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/0b1e363cd5fe4df28fc96c2fdbbc705c\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"bb576e893ebf482c38b37d03d9000ddc087189cb8f3fc19026765253c7837298\",\"relevance\":434,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"4a57c032b54142169a4434e38a42bcc182ff22d6683e7878291cc7605f462b88\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.5635384\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.5635383; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/5635383\",\"title\":\"INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES APPLIED IN EDUCATION: COMMUNICATION AND DISTANCE EDUCATION\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Current Education seeks the use of information and communication technologies in education.

The sample comprised 1,126 specialists in Information Technology, Computer Technology, Computer Education, Computer Science, and Computer Engineering working in public higher education instructions throughout the country. The selection was the result of multi-stage random sampling from 76 public higher education instructions that offer undergraduate education. The instrument was a questionnaire form on essential digital competency components for undergraduate students in higher education institutions. The question items employed a 7-point Likert scale and showed Cronbach\\u2019s alpha values for the content validity and reliability at a range of.93-.97 per domain and .87-.99 per component.

The study methodology deploys the differentiation of philosophical and scientific paradigms. Pre-digital education is associated with the classical paradigm. Accordingly, the parameters of pre-digital education include the notions of finite and true knowledge, a singular type of learning algorithms, a balanced learning process, and the deterministic influence of educational programs. The indicators of digital education are identified within the framework of the non-classical and post-non-classical paradigms. The non-classical form of digital education is characterized by the presence of alternative educational programs, the polysemantic object of study, infinite knowledge, and pragmatic orientation. This form of education accentuates the subjective and personal context, the opportunities for plural explanations, and the technologies for studying the singular, the local, and the fragmental. Digital education contributes to modeling infinite discourses and intersubjective practices. All educational innovations within digital education appear as a way of ontological and gnoseological construction. Digital education enhances the role of interdisciplinary education. The competencies of \\u201ccross-cutting\\u201d and extensive understanding of a complex subject appear. Students should be focused on the results of teaching in various disciplines.

Humanity became dependent on the Internet with the increasing technological developments and especially the emergence of the pandemic. Everything from socializing to bank transactions, education, digital games, grocery shopping, and governmental processes are now actualized on digital platforms. The impact of new media on daily life and the ways of use have caused the concept of citizenship to change in a world that has become more global with the effect of the pandemic. Borders began to become blurry and concepts to become global. Subscribers spending a lot of time on digital platforms began to feel that they now belong to those platforms. Thus, digital citizenship has become an important subject. The first thing that comes to mind considering digital citizenship is the Model of Citizenship Model by Ribble and Bailey. This model of digital citizenship has a framework consisting of nine elements associated with each other. In this study, the digital citizenship elements starting with the digital access of digital technology users as digital trade, digital communication, digital literacy, digital ethics, digital law, digital rights and responsibilities, digital health, and digital security based on this model will be examined. Mastery of each element brings Internet subscribers one step closer to be named as digital citizens. These elements also serve as guidance for all subjects transferred to the digital medium such as education, economy, health, and law after the pandemic. The relationship between digital citizenship and the rapidly developing digital world during the Covid-19 pandemic will be revealed in this study. The researchers intend to examine the way digital citizenship is perceived in Turkey with semi- structured interviews.\",\"published_in\":\"The Turkish Online Journal of Design, Art and Communication, Vol 11, Iss 3, Pp 1019-1035 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital citizenship; digital communication; digital socializing; digital ethics; digital privacy; digital (online) education; Fine Arts; N; Arts in general; NX1-820; Communication.

We find that 1) digital education orientation or on-boarding processes for faculty vary widely; 2) institutions employ an extensive array of professional development practices for digital education; 3) institutions report culture change, work security, and unclear expectations as challenges in providing digital education training and support; and 4) institutions articulate aspirations and hopes around professional development investments in order to build digital education capacity.

Leadership perspectives on edtech in a COVID-19 reality\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract The edtech community has promoted claims that digital education enhances access, learning, and collaboration. The COVID-19 pandemic tested these claims like never before, as higher education systems seemingly overnight had to move teaching online. Through a sequential mixed-method approach, we investigated how 85 higher education leaders in 24 countries experienced this rapid digital transformation. Through their experiences, we identified the multiple and overlapping factors that contribute to an institution\\u2019s ability to realize the potential of digital education, in terms of access, learning and collaboration, whilst highlighting deeply rooted inequalities at the individual, institutional and system level. Drawing on these empirics, we put forth recommendations for closing the digital divides and pathways forward. Higher education leaders are uniquely positioned to move beyond the emergency adoption of online learning towards inclusive, long-term visions for digital education, which emphasize collaboration over individual gain.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, Vol 18, Iss 1, Pp 1-17 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital learning; Higher education; Edtech; Leadership; Governance; Digital transformation; Special aspects of education; LC8-6691; Information technology; T58.5-58.64\",\"subject\":\"Digital learning; Higher education; Edtech; Leadership; Governance; Digital transformation; Special aspects of education; Information technology;; 5-\",\"authors\":\"Melissa Laufer; Anne Leiser; Bronwen Deacon; Paola Perrin de Brichambaut; Benedikt Fecher; Christian Kobsda; Friedrich Hesse\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s41239-021-00287-6\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"bb5c373933a9e5fcb2c8241d69c66ca5d5e968e0d2b3bd884e913faf3d7e344e\",\"relevance\":393,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s41239-021-00287-6\"},{\"id\":\"b273b353f7f966b9da37beee21db0b39522c6f75dc18e71848923e8953200d00\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2263\\/80564; http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.17159\\/2223-0386\\/2020\\/n24a6\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2263\\/80564; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17159\\/2223-0386\\/2020\\/n24a6\",\"title\":\"A self-study of pedagogical experiences in History Education at a university during the COVID-19 pandemic\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Educational transformation is an ongoing process. However, in 2020 the transformation in South Africa was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This global health threat was inadvertently a catalyst for considerable change within the field of education. Considering that the nature of COVID-19 was infectious, the best mode of delivery for education to students during the pandemic was digital platforms. For the History Education department at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), this was a significant transition from the conventional contact methods. While digital platforms were used under normal conditions to complement contact lectures, the transition meant that all teaching was completely dependent on digital platforms. Navigating this change was both interesting and challenging for me as a teacher and supervisor of History Education. This paper is a self-study of my experiences of engaging with online History Education at postgraduate and undergraduate levels within Higher Education. History Education modules had to be re-engineered, and pedagogical considerations had to be explored to align with the use of digital software. The online transition was not seamless and was accompanied by challenges that ranged from technological inaccessibility and teacher training for online education to academic disparities. At the onset of the transition, technology proved to exacerbate existing geo-social and educational inequalities within the learning community at the UKZN\\u2019s History Education department. It undeniably took a considerable amount of time to acclimatise to the new digital platforms for online education. Eventually, there were visible successes. For instance, new online pedagogies proved effective in traversing History Education modules via online education. Training in the use of software and applications was also useful in achieving the learning objectives of History Education modules. Online resources, such as multimedia, were easier to incorporate into History Education lectures. This provided an integrative shift between theory and real-life experiences. Arguably, the COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst for embracing digital platforms, which we, as educationalists, may not have otherwise implemented were it not a necessity. ; https:\\/\\/upjournals.up.ac.za\\/index.php\\/yesterday_and_today\\/article\\/view\\/1906\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"History Education; COVID-19; Multimodal Model for Online Education; Digital platforms; Higher education; Remote learning\",\"subject\":\"History Education; Multimodal Model for Online Education; Digital platforms; Higher education; Remote learning\",\"authors\":\"Iyer, Leevina M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2263\\/80564\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"b273b353f7f966b9da37beee21db0b39522c6f75dc18e71848923e8953200d00\",\"relevance\":392,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"f17513123bfb3097e7071ecba4cb29767cd129d34fbd3507f1054526997bee83\",\"relation\":\"Paedagogica Historica vol:50 issue:6 pages:861-870; https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/465817; 0030-9230; doi:10.1080\\/00309230.2014.955511; 1477-674X\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/465817; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/00309230.2014.955511\",\"title\":\"Towards a history of e-ducation? Exploring the possibilities of digital humanities for the history of education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"n the past few years, worries about decreasing jobs or even the possible disappearance of the history of education as a field of study have frequently surfaced. Hence, the question arises as to whether the history of education, as a field of study, has a future \\u2013 or is it, as many authors have remarked, in danger? This article starts from the idea that our field of study is definitely not alone in its struggle: many branches of the humanities have fallen victim to similar appeals of economic efficiency and relevance. In response to these developments, digital humanities in particular have been identified as a way out of the impasse. Therefore, this article explores the ways in which digital humanities or digital history can offer valuable contributions to the future of the history of education. This paper advocates that, although digital humanities or digital history cannot magically make our problems disappear, historians of education should further embrace the possibilities digital technology has to offer for the investigation of our educational past. I argue that digital technology not only has the potential to make our lives considerably easier; it can also help in addressing new research questions, give new meaning to existing concepts within the history of education and further enhance the interdisciplinary character of our discipline. ; status: published\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-09-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital history; technology; history of education\",\"subject\":\"digital history; technology; history of education\",\"authors\":\"Van Ruyskensvelde, Sarah\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/465817\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"f17513123bfb3097e7071ecba4cb29767cd129d34fbd3507f1054526997bee83\",\"relevance\":389,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"b42ae6b461e947d2237bb3222d2b3579dbb5d9c5f55dc6be18f1a73df9b1faf0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.idunn.no\\/dk\\/2015\\/02\\/guidelines_and_regulations_for_teaching_digital_competence_; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0809-6724; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1891-943X; 0809-6724; 1891-943X; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/141634970a3547bba0b28dd852322600\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/141634970a3547bba0b28dd852322600\",\"title\":\"Guidelines and Regulations for Teaching Digital Competence in Schools and Teacher Education: A Weak Link?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Teacher education has recently been criticised for not fulfilling its obligation to adequately prepare teachers to utilise digital tools in the classroom. In this paper, we raise the question of why Norwegian teacher education does not prepare student teachers to integrate digital tools into their teaching as required by the Norwegian curriculum. We question the formal premises governing the development of digital competence in teacher education and how they correspond with the requirements of the Norwegian national education curriculum. To gain insight into this question, we analysed how digital competence is presented in the official key documents that create the framework for teacher education, and compared them to the requirements of the Norwegian National Curriculum. Our findings indicate that there is a weak link between the curriculum and the premises for digital competence in teacher education.\",\"published_in\":\"Nordic Journal of Digital Literacy, Vol 10, Pp 69-83 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital competence; teacher education reform; national curriculum; Digitalcompetence; teachereducationreform; nationalcurriculum; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"Digital competence; teacher education reform; national curriculum; Digitalcompetence; teachereducationreform; nationalcurriculum; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"B\\u00e5rd Ketil Engen; Tonje Hilde Gi\\u00e6ver; Louise Mifsud\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/141634970a3547bba0b28dd852322600\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"b42ae6b461e947d2237bb3222d2b3579dbb5d9c5f55dc6be18f1a73df9b1faf0\",\"relevance\":386,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"f4cd2408bd28b37472ad6808664d687e0643691f9d65f7a84963761c3b60ec74\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/2140650; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/epess\\/issue\\/64895\\/1038710\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/epess\\/issue\\/64895\\/1038710\",\"title\":\"Digital Literacy Perspective: Reflections on Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Today&#039;s society demands more and more different types of skills.

This article examines European Union policies addressing the matter of digital technologies in education, discusses the application of different technological tools in education and looks at the links with the fundamental right to education. It is argued that the right to education should be expanded to encompass technologically enhanced education while also recognizing that digital technologies bring both extraordinary opportunities and risks. It is further suggested that a number of basic principles and essential safeguards must be ensured in the process of adapting education to technological progress.

The following research methods were used: 1) a conceptual analysis of scientific publications, forecasts, foresight-studies and analytical reports; 2) expert interviews, 3) a questionnaire based survey (32 experts \\u2013 researchers, professors, representatives of government and consulting companies). The following core groups of digital technologies are designated: 1) digital solutions for defining the personal goals of education, educational navigation, building a project for an individual educational trajectory; 2) adaptive educational environment for the implementation of an individual educational trajectory; 3) digital solutions for learning activities support; monitoring the results of education; solutions for educational logistics; 4) digital solutions for assessment and certification (personal identification and competency assessment); 5) digital solutions for career support and lifelong education; 6) digital solutions for building and supporting university communities (including teachers, students, graduates, university partners); 7) digital solutions for monitoring and modeling the dynamics of competences at the population level. Each group includes 3\\u201312 technologies, so it is possible to build a detailed \\u201cmap\\u201d of digital technologies for higher education sphere.

This paper presents the findings of a systematic review of empirical studies published between May 2009 and May 2019 focusing on students\\u2019 learning outcomes and teachers\\u2019 pedagogical activities in digital game-based learning in primary education. The results indicated that support, guidance, and interaction are the most frequently used pedagogical activities during gameplay sessions in primary education and that teachers\\u2019 most significant concern with regard to learning outcomes is knowledge acquisition, followed by attitude and motivation, skill outcomes, and behavior change. The findings will be useful for enabling researchers and teachers to integrate effective pedagogical activities into digital game-based learning strategies. Further studies are proposed to explore teachers\\u2019 competencies in relation to digital learning environments in primary education.\",\"published_in\":\"Sun , L , Chen , X & Ruokamo , H 2021 , ' Digital Game-based Pedagogical Activities in Primary Education : A Review of Ten Years\\u2019 Studies ' , International Journal of Technology in Teaching and Learning , vol. 16 , no. 2 , pp. 78-92 . < https:\\/\\/jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu\\/issues\\/ >\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital game-based learning; earning outcomes; pedagogical activities; primary education; \\/dk\\/atira\\/pure\\/person\\/fieldofscience2010\\/5\\/18; Media and communications\",\"subject\":\"digital game-based learning; earning outcomes; pedagogical activities; primary education; Media and communications\",\"authors\":\"Sun, Liping; Chen, Xiaojun; Ruokamo, Heli\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/research.ulapland.fi\\/fi\\/publications\\/acf480c4-b70d-47c9-867e-9c4915192ad2\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"ae5551a3bc29408e617403a4afcc28da2c9a6f884a4f8725caf56254ec218df5\",\"relevance\":379,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"fd038302bc7e469a0cdd51be783637df979d2c2c85c0a9c4464390b0f478f4ff\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3591450\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3591449; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3591449\",\"title\":\"Digital Citizenship in Education Visioning Safety and Responsibilities in Digital World\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The inevitability of digital tools and technology usage has accelerated over the past 30 years and continues to grow rapidly.

The article is devoted to the development of digital education. The gap between generations and social groups exacerbates the contradictions between the education system and the demands of the information society, and the increase in the volume, accessibility, speed of acquisition and exchange of knowledge has changed the style of knowledge of modern man. The key competence was the ability to distinguish important from unimportant, reliable from unreliable. Students need to purposefully develop digital identity. All this gives rise to a set of problems facing the modern school. The purpose of the study described in the article is to identify promising ways to digitalize the school, build a model of digital school and identify a set of factors that are important for the transformation of the school for all in the school for everyone. Methodology. In the course of the study, based on the analysis of existing approaches to the development of digital technologies and digitalization of education, the ways of formation and development of a digital school are revealed. The structure of the core of digital education providing comparability of the knowledge, values, skills and competences mastered and shown in various types of activity of the person is defined. This is the value, activity and content basis for the formation of digital socio-cultural educational environment. This core is proposed to be considered as a basis for the development of concepts of subject areas, GEF and educational programs at all levels of education. Results. The interpretation of the term \\u00abdigital education\\u00bb is given, which is understood as educational activity, the key factors of which are digital data, processing, exchange and analysis of which allow the individual to achieve new results of education in a specific sociocultural situation. According to the model, the digital school provides not only training and education, but also effective integration of the individual into a high-tech rapidly changing complex environment. The educational ecosystem is an integrative socio-cultural environment, in the center of which is not a teacher of a traditional school, but a student, surrounded by peers and adults who help him realize his personal educational trajectory. Conclusion. The article outlines the prerequisites for a new era-the era of digital education, formulated the definition of the term \\u00abdigital education\\u00bb, justified the relevance of the development and the structure of the core of digital education, describes the model of digital school, presents the structure of the educational ecosystem and the effects of its implementation for different stakeholders.\",\"published_in\":\"RUDN Journal of Informatization in Education, Vol 16, Iss 4, Pp 295-307 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital education; the core of digital education; digital school; educational ecosystem; Information technology; T58.5-58.64\",\"subject\":\"digital education; the core of digital education; digital school; educational ecosystem; Information technology;; 5-\",\"authors\":\"Alexander M.

In this sense, the capacity to understand what constitutes agency in digital contexts of education and evaluate students\\u2019 digital agency is now crucial. In contrast to traditional approaches to student agency in digital contexts that subsume technologies to educational intentions, media research has illustrated a more complex interplay between humans and technology. Drawing on this insight, the paper argues for a more critical disposition to digital student agency, wherein relational, cultural, and technological dynamics are central to agency. Specifically, the article proposes a framework for digital student agency that distinguishes five critical domains to student agency in digital contexts: (1) agentic possibility, (2) digital self-representation, (3) data uses, (4) digital sociality, and (5) digital temporality. The article concludes by outlining the implications of the framework for educational practice and academic research around student agency and student learning. Specifically, adopting the framework implies changes in how we investigate student agency in digital contexts and enables critical investigations of student-centred teaching practices.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontline Learning Research, Vol 9, Iss 3, Pp 52-68 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"student agency; networked publics; learning; educational technologies; digital education; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"student agency; networked publics; learning; educational technologies; digital education; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"Maria Hvid Stenalt\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14786\\/flr.v9i3.697\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"d6dec303926e3567b87c11b828a24e1646f47f2cf4df7303a2678b046764ae7d\",\"relevance\":361,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14786\\/flr.v9i3.697\"},{\"id\":\"f014453f8fdf7f9463758d7e3c7bcc7fe069adc14a51abd503be9e73e956e987\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.lib.uoguelph.ca\\/index.php\\/ajote\\/article\\/view\\/1936; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1916-7822; 1916-7822; doi:10.21083\\/ajote.v2i1.1936; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/54118e2ceefc4f0d901fade6bb868674\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21083\\/ajote.v2i1.1936; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/54118e2ceefc4f0d901fade6bb868674\",\"title\":\"TOWARDS UTILIZING NEW DIGITAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF PEACE EDUCATION IN NIGERIA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Recent events in Nigeria have shown that the country cannot move forward without considering peace education in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions.

Tertiary students, internationally face both opportunities and challenges in learning and adapting to this paradigm shift in the delivery of education. It remains unclear how students in international contexts are responding to these changes in digital learning during and post-COVID-19. This paper aims to compare student perceptions of digital competence, confidence, and resilience in present times using data from surveys of tertiary students from Australia, Cambodia, China, India, and Malaysia. There are disparities not only in the teaching and learning pedagogies amongst these countries but also in the levels of technological advancement, infrastructure support, and pace of digital innovation in the delivery of courses. These differences have put in focus students both digital competencies and resilience as they pursue higher education on various digital learning platforms. Resilience includes the ability to bounce back or adapt from stress (Smith et al., 2008) Digital resilience is students tech-savviness and preparedness to adapt to different digital environments as they pursue higher education. This paper examines the perceptions of tertiary undergraduate students from these countries in this emerging new digital learning norm-. A total of 687 tertiary students from the aforementioned countries participated in a survey to questions related to digital competence, confidence in using and\\/or adapting to digital innovation, and resilience. Statistically significant attributes are identified to help better understand the challenges these culturally diverse students perceive in digital learning environments. This study will reveal barriers that impact the digital transformation of undergraduate students which can be used to recommend necessary teaching and learning support frameworks to enhance their digital competence and resilience.

In addition, the take up of social networking technologies and innovative methods of digital publishing have encouraged educators to produce, distribute and share content and commentary. Grey literature may make a substantial contribution to education even though issues such as credibility, access and a lack of standards can pose problems for producers and users. This paper begins by providing a context for the discussion of grey literature within the broader policy and education environment in Australia. An overview of grey literature as it appears in education in Australia introducing evidence of its usage, dissemination and application in Australian education then follows. Evidence about the access, dissemination and use of grey literature is drawn from an examination of the characteristics of a leading social networking and digital publishing service that was used by educators in schools, training institutes and teacher education faculties. This evidence is discussed in the context of influential national, state and institutional policies that address the use of digital technologies in education. As the take up of digital technologies in education increases, there is an expectation that the access to, dissemination of and use of digital publishing by and for educators will increase and have an impact on online professional learning and awareness of education research and practices.

Apps, games, computer programs, and social media, etc. can support and improve learning processes. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions of social life accelerated a shift towards the application of digital media in education as well as in distance learning. This paper answers questions about the current usage of digital media in non-formal education in Germany, especially in the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The results of a 2020 survey in Germany with 111 participants show that digital media are an integral part of non-formal education; in particular, audio and video recording and filesharing are used often. Notably, the usage of web calls and webinars has increased since the pandemic. Regarding the disadvantages of digitals formats, participants note the investment in time and effort as well as the expensive equipment needed for development. Despite being dissatisfied with existing offers, a lot of institutions have not developed their own digital education formats (yet). This indicates a possible need for further training and education of educators in non-formal ESD, enabling them to independently create digital formats. This would also contribute to the quality of digital formats, of which many were possibly developed without proper expertise.\",\"published_in\":\"Sustainability, Vol 14, Iss 2114, p 2114 (2022)\",\"year\":\"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital education; environmental education; global education; #ESDfor2030; Digital Sustainability Education (DSE); pandemic; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350\",\"subject\":\"digital education; environmental education; global education; #ESDfor Digital Sustainability Education (DSE); pandemic; Environmental effects of industries and plants; Renewable energy sources; Environmental sciences; \",\"authors\":\"Florian Kohler; Alina Kuthe; Fiona Rochholz; Alexander Siegmund\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su14042114\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"c7e2ac3729c9f80418531bc08ffb11316c1748d43ee8773f83fb8e2e191856a9\",\"relevance\":342,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su14042114\"},{\"id\":\"768903861b7367873e2932fc30df9ba4ce65b59da14ab96cbf4da9b82aa0ef8f\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/1299752; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/sead\\/issue\\/57800\\/797372; doi:10.29250\\/sead.797372\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/sead\\/issue\\/57800\\/797372; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.29250\\/sead.797372\",\"title\":\"Innovation and the Digital Transformation of Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Digital transformation institutions expect fundamental disruptions in nature of both demand and supply of the economic delivery model for higher education.

In youth leisure, computers are more than information devices: they convey stories, images, identities, and fantasies through providing imaginative opportunities for play, and as cultural and ideological forms. In this paper, I report on a project conducted with teacher education students at a university in Johannesburg, South Africa. The focus of the project is to examine how students construct their identities digitally through the multimodal narratives they create in the English classroom. To do this I report on two narratives, as well as a recurring theme, decolonisation. The latter theme is significant because it was during the time of this project that South African universities found themselves in the grip of decolonisation and free education protests. I use New Literacy Studies as a framework to theorise literacy practices, and the work of Hall and others to theorise identity. The paper presents further possible implications of digital identity construction for teaching and learning.Keywords: decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"published_in\":\"South African Journal of Education; Vol 38, No 2 (2018); 1-9 ; 2076-3433 ; 0256-0100\",\"year\":\"2018-06-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"subject\":\"decolonization; digital identities; digital literacies; digital narratives; higher education; South Africa\",\"authors\":\"Kajee, Leila\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ajol.info\\/index.php\\/saje\\/article\\/view\\/173120\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"23f1739d2f39a41b3aebb4e7d3dbf751ba9741d5c2957bf88dd59684c8236bb4\",\"relevance\":340,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e2a51ee685bd18f8871d544409218fda15fe707532ca2bb508e09543b0f0ee5c\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.2575649; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2575650; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2575650; oai:zenodo.org:2575650\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2575650; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2575650\",\"title\":\"Internet Skills as a Measure of Digital Inclusion among Mathematics Education Students: Implications for Sustainable Human Capital Development in Nigeria\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Global technology penetration reports have consistently indicated high levels of digital technology adoption among Nigerian students. Considering that mathematics education students are being trained to manifest proficiency in vital areas of communication, information technology, critical thinking, leadership, teamwork, problem solving and entrepreneurship, the imperative of emphasizing the place of digital skills in their education is more relevant now than ever. Consequently, this study adopts a survey research design to provide detailed background information of component indicators of digital literacy among a sample of 215 Mathematics Education students drawn randomly from a Federal University in North Central, Nigeria. The Digital Access Index (DAI) and the Measure of Internet Skills (MOIS) were used as standardized measures of digital inclusion, with data analyzed using mean, standard deviation and simple charts. The findings of the study indicate that the status of digital inclusion among mathematics education students in Nigeria is high. The implications of this outcome for sustainable human capital development were discussed. Evidently, the level of internet skills revealed in this study is an indication that despite existing context in Nigeria, youths will continue to negotiate and chart their way to political participation and economic success.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Education and Knowledge Management (IJEKM) 2(1) 1-16\",\"year\":\"2019-02-22\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital Inclusion; Digital Literacy; Mathematics Education; Internet Skills; Human Capital; Sustainable Development; Nigerian Higher Education\",\"subject\":\"Digital Inclusion; Digital Literacy; Mathematics Education; Internet Skills; Human Capital; Sustainable Development; Nigerian Higher Education\",\"authors\":\"Iji, Clement Onwu; Abah, Joshua Abah\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2575650\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"e2a51ee685bd18f8871d544409218fda15fe707532ca2bb508e09543b0f0ee5c\",\"relevance\":339,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"41d7cab15aaf07689d62b8bd9c3faa7d912ac90691b3d499bb51a0a8a7dfdbbb\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/1350293X.2021.1971730; Norges forskningsr\\u00e5d: 275576; Universitetet i Stavanger: IN-10986; Undheim, M.

Knowledge, skills, and understandings of literacy emerge through sociocultural interactions with non-digital tools (e.g., paper-printed books) and digital tools (e.g., touch screen tablets). However, debate is ongoing over the role that digital experiences play in emergent literacy development. Researchers have voiced the need to conceptualise a common framework for literacy development that considers the emergence of digital literacy skills alongside conventional literacy skills and how these skills might interact during development. This is particularly important in light of the increasing use of digital texts used by young children, such as E-books and digital games. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that might guide research and practice by examining the relationships between emergent literacy skills, emergent digital literacy skills, and proficiency in reading and writing. ; Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Education and Professional Studies ; No Full Text\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education Systems not elsewhere classified\",\"subject\":\"Education Systems not elsewhere classified\",\"authors\":\"Neumann, Michelle; Finger, Glenn; Neumann, David\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10072\\/123797\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"7bfc7096443611ba6098c9924e3fc578d188dc9e763f34ed513bc76cd325cb48\",\"relevance\":329,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"1bc3a3358f7da6edb767ad1c91ac28f38573160ffca7c66594a7234db03258a9\",\"relation\":\"Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education (AACE); 978-1-939797-08-7; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11189\\/3465; https:\\/\\/www.editlib.org\\/p\\/147705\\/\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11189\\/3465; https:\\/\\/www.editlib.org\\/p\\/147705\\/\",\"title\":\"Using digital storytelling to prepare new teachers for multicultural and digital natives' classrooms.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The 21 Century learners are said to be digital natives.

Examples are given as an active position in the direction of ensuring digital transformations of educational and managerial processes in a particular educational institution; it contributes to the implementation of national tasks in the direction of ensuring the digital development of society. Emphasis is placed on how the role of methodological services is changing, on the need for systemic changes in the perception of the educational institution's perception of the process of ensuring the digital development of both teachers and students, and vocational education institutions in general. The study examines four vectors of digital development for vocational (technical) education institutions of Ukraine from the possible options, proposed by European colleagues who have already shown positive results at the level of the education system (vocational in particular) and a separate institution of vocational (technical) education. In particular, the possibility of measuring the level of digital development of the educational institution through the use of the SELFIE service, developed by the European Commission together with a group of educational experts and practitioners from European countries, was considered. The platform is available in more than thirty languages, including Ukrainian. Examples of online tools common in both European educational communities and those, developed by domestic specialists (but taking into account European experience,) are given, thanks to which it is possible to carry out self-assessment, assessment, and soon certification of digital competencies of teachers.

The aim of the article is to analyze concepts such as digital literacy, digital competences, digital consumption, digitalization of society, which will determine the role and place of modern universities in the process of developing a new concept of higher education. In this paper, the preconditions that have become decisive are analyzed. Factors for the comprehensive introduction of digital literacy in the university study process, the issues related to digital competencies of students and the organization of higher education in the post are considered. The study of the digital education role in the processes of transforming the country's economy and the formation of a single digital space, the goals and objectives of universities in the reform of higher education are determined, a model for assessing the digital competence of students is proposed. Research methods: analysis (separation of the general concept of \\u00abdigital competence\\u00bb into constituent elements), synthesis (merging of divided and investigated parts), induction (general review of digital technologies and digital competences), deduction (transition from the general perception of digital technologies and digital competences to the definition properties and characteristics of individual competencies and skills), abstraction (definition of peculiarities inherent in digital competencies), concretization (study of the features of individual digital computing ten this). Scientific novelty of the article is a model of digital literacy of students, developed on the basis of a pyramidal model taking into account the concept of digital competence. This model is based on a high level of understanding and generalization of digital student skills. The purpose of using the proposed model is to identify all spheres of knowledge, skills and abilities that should be considered for the formation and evaluation of digital competence. The proposed model is quite flexible and can be adapted to different target groups of students and digital users. The object of the research is the level of students' digital literacy, models, methods and techniques for measuring it. From the point of view of authors, special attention deserves a model, developed on the basis of a pyramidal model, taking into account the concept of digital competence. This model is based on a high level of understanding and generalization of students' digital skills. The purpose of using the proposed model is to identify all spheres of knowledge, skills and abilities that should be considered for the formation and evaluation of digital competence. The proposed model is flexible enough and can be adapted to different target groups of students and digital users. The main conclusions of the study can be considered: 1. Introduction of digital technologies in higher education to increase the level of digital literacy is an urgent requirement of time. 2. The purpose of introducing digital technologies into higher education is the training of highly skilled professionals for work in a post\\u2010industrial society. 3. Modern life requires the introduction of digital technologies in absolutely all spheres of human activity. 4.

Today, it has become the basis for the digital transformation of education, whose essence is transforming the methods of professional teaching by integrating digital technologies and moving to a data-based decision-making model. Among the participants of educational relations, there are diametrically opposite views on the possibility and feasibility of digitalization of education, especially at its initial stage. The purpose of this research is to present an authorial standpoint on the problem of digitalization of education with regard to both elementary general education in general, and digitalization of the Mathematics and Computer Science subject area, in particular, at the level of primary general education. The research methods include content analysis of scientific articles and methodological publications, the regulatory framework of school education, as well as generalization and systematization of international research in the field of the digital transformation of education.

With the digital transformation of education a significant change occurs not only in terms of what is considered to be a matter of education, but also in the very principles of interaction between the subjects of education. In order to do this, in the first section several examples of conceptual justifications of applying digital technologies in education are examined with the task of demonstrating how in such justifications the activity of education is reduced to the process of learning and what risks such instrumental interpretation engenders. Then, these issues are analyzed and contextualized utilizing the material of the philosophical discussion of the 20th century - the critique of the progressive education in the analytic philosophy of education. By outlining the relevance of the arguments of discussion on manner\\/matter to realities of digital education, the issue of the dominance of the logic of learning in current education is analyzed. In the last section several adjustments to the contemporary discourse on digitalization of education are proposed, aimed at finding a balance between individual and social dimensions of the problem of matter of education, given the current tendency of mass personalization in education. Particularly, the importance of the idea of education as a common good in the contemporary educational discourse is claimed.\",\"published_in\":\"RUDN Journal of Philosophy, Vol 25, Iss 4, Pp 626-639 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"philosophy; education; digital technologies; matter of education; formalization; mass personalization; adaptive learning; socialization; common good; subjects; Philosophy.

Nowadays, when a digital society is being built, digital transformation is becoming the basis for the world economic development. This leads to a rapid change in the professions being in demand in the employment market and, consequently, the professional requirements for the qualification framework, competences in particular. Thus, educational activities require updating the content and methods of teaching, finding innovative forms of learning, expanding the access to educational resources, implementing learning opportunities without restrictions on the bases of space and time, introducing new approaches to the organisation of educational services in general. The purpose of this study is to analyse and systematise the European experience in the field of the digital transformation of education, outlining some ways to use it for transforming the education in Ukraine. The main research methods used are as follows: a systematic analysis of regulatory, scientific, and methodological sources on the digital transformation of education in European countries, the study of the methodological tools to support teachers in the development of a digital society. For the digital transformation of education, it is necessary to take a number of important steps which include: the development of normative initiatives by the state to ensure the regulatory framework enabling the transformation of education; the modernisation of educational systems, the updating of the content of school and university education; training and retraining of teachers, taking into consideration the increasing proficiency level of their digital skills and competences. The paper presents in detail how these steps are implemented in the EU. Based on the analysed sources, we can come to these conclusions: in Europe, the conditions facilitating an increase in pedagogues\\u2019 proficiency in terms of digital competences have been created; the tools aimed at supporting their activities have been developed, which contributes to the digital transformation of education in general. Ukraine has also recognised the digital transformation as a priority policy for the development of the digital economy and the emergence of a digital society as a whole. To ensure a quality educational process, the modern education system of Ukraine needs changes. The digitalisation of all levels of education, and, in the future, their digital transformation appear to be important steps in this respect.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u041d\\u0430\\u0443\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0412\\u0456\\u0441\\u043d\\u0438\\u043a \\u041f\\u0456\\u0432\\u0434\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0443\\u043a\\u0440\\u0430\\u0457\\u043d\\u0441\\u044c\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u041d\\u0430\\u0446\\u0456\\u043e\\u043d\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u041f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0423\\u043d\\u0456\\u0432\\u0435\\u0440\\u0441\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u0442\\u0443 \\u0456\\u043c\\u0435\\u043d\\u0456 \\u041a. \\u0414. \\u0423\\u0448\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u044c\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e, Vol 132, Iss 3, Pp 71-78 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital transformation; digitalisation of education; digital transformation of education; digital society; Education (General); L7-991\",\"subject\":\"digital transformation; digitalisation of education; digital transformation of education; digital society; \",\"authors\":\"Strutynska Oksana\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24195\\/2617-6688-2020-3-9\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"69324f698af7c7e3b101b7e31873c10ab7b36204600731a5f930e9074d570c5e\",\"relevance\":289,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24195\\/2617-6688-2020-3-9\"},{\"id\":\"f7caddbadb3ef9e27a2c62ffd24d06c67ee3db7f6a6b2699cb25eb0b7c84b4be\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\\/portal\\/en\\/publications\\/screenwriting-higher-education-and-digital-ecologies-of-expertise(e50f587c-eff8-42f6-84b3-c0aaabb2ba6c).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/14790726.2015.1131304; https:\\/\\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\\/ws\\/files\\/48113420\\/Ashton_and_Conor_2016_Screenwriting_higher_education_and_digital_ecologies_of_expertise_New_Writing.docx; http:\\/\\/www.scopus.com\\/inward\\/record.url?scp=84958052078&partnerID=8YFLogxK\",\"title\":\"Screenwriting, higher education and digital ecologies of expertise\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this paper, we examine screenwriting and higher education in terms of emergent, digital \\u2018ecologies of screenwriting expertise\\u2019.

While some literature indicates certain challenges in this regard, in general, the emphasis is on an encouragement and promotion of digital technology in higher education. While we recognised the positive potential of the use of digital technology in higher education, we were cautious of an instrumentalist and disembodied understanding of (digital) technology and its potential impact on higher education \\u2013 as a sector of education and as a body of students. Aim: To re-conceptualise the way in which technology is understood for its use in the higher education sector, as is argued, would be of benefit for transformation in higher education. Setting: South African Higher Education sector. Methods: Phenomenology of embodiment. Results: An embodied understanding of technology through the embodied phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty and an explication of its potential for transformation in higher education via the working concept of the Embodied Screen leads to a full understanding of the student as embodied and socially-embedded individual. Conclusion: A more holistic and embodied understanding of digital technology serves to supplement transformation in higher education, especially if transformation is itself understood in concrete social and bodily terms as is the case in the South African context.\",\"published_in\":\"Transformation in Higher Education, Vol 3, Iss 0, Pp e1-e8 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital technology; technology; embodiment; higher education; transformation; merleau-Ponty; phenomenology; Education; L; Theory and practice of education; LB5-3640\",\"subject\":\"digital technology; technology; embodiment; higher education; transformation; merleau-Ponty; phenomenology; Education; L; Theory and practice of education; \",\"authors\":\"Jean du Toit; Ann\\u00e9 H.

Digital education is increasingly used for clinical practice guideline dissemination and adoption. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of digital education in improving the adoption of clinical practice guidelines. Methods We performed a systematic review and searched seven electronic databases from January 1990 to September 2018. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We included studies in any language evaluating the effectiveness of digital education on clinical practice guidelines compared to other forms of education or no intervention in healthcare professionals. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of the body of evidence. Results Seventeen trials involving 2382 participants were included. The included studies were diverse with a largely unclear or high risk of bias. They mostly focused on physicians, evaluated computer-based interventions with limited interactivity and measured participants\\u2019 knowledge and behaviour. With regard to knowledge, studies comparing the effect of digital education with no intervention showed a moderate, statistically significant difference in favour of digital education intervention (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI 0.16, 1.54; I 2 = 83%, n = 3, moderate quality of evidence). Studies comparing the effect of digital education with traditional learning on knowledge showed a small, statistically non-significant difference in favour of digital education (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI \\u2212 0.12, 0.59; I 2 = 34%, n = 3, moderate quality of evidence). Three studies measured participants\\u2019 skills and reported mixed results. Of four studies measuring satisfaction, three studies favoured digital education over traditional learning. Of nine studies evaluating healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviour change, only one study comparing email-delivered, spaced education intervention to no intervention reported improvement in the intervention group. Of three studies reporting patient outcomes, only one study comparing email-delivered, spaced education games to non-interactive online resources reported modest improvement in the intervention group. The quality of evidence for outcomes other than knowledge was mostly judged as low due to risk of bias, imprecision and\\/or inconsistency. Conclusions Health professions digital education on clinical practice guidelines is at least as effective as traditional learning and more effective than no intervention in terms of knowledge. Most studies report little or no difference in healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviours and patient outcomes. The only intervention shown to improve healthcare professionals\\u2019 behaviour and modestly patient outcomes was email-delivered, spaced education. Future research should evaluate interactive, simulation-based and spaced forms of digital education and report on outcomes such as skills, behaviour, patient outcomes and cost.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Medicine, Vol 17, Iss 1, Pp 1-16 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Clinical practice guidelines; Health professions education; Systematic review; Digital education; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"Clinical practice guidelines; Health professions education; Systematic review; Digital education; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Lorainne Tudor Car; Aijia Soong; Bhone Myint Kyaw; Kee Leng Chua; Naomi Low-Beer; Azeem Majeed\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12916-019-1370-1\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"78a502dba86c273a26dbdcffad138cd76409bb3d9eeb223409e1a6860b18e856\",\"relevance\":271,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12916-019-1370-1\"},{\"id\":\"3dc9260da0f83b7d5c5d309496ddb74f279ca321043d3b74f307d9e928546434\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.alexandria.unisg.ch\\/248385\\/1\\/Developing%20Digital%20Competences%20of%20Teachers_final.pdf; Seufert, Sabine & Scheffler, Nina (2016) Developing Digital Competences of Vocational Teachers.

Particularly vocational schools are obviously under pressure to deal with changes due to digitalization in many sectors and professions. One reason why technology-based learning is still underdeveloped in schools could be the insufficient digital competences of teachers. Presently most teachers gain their knowledge on how to use digital media for learning and teaching informally. In the implementation of formal educational efforts, a low practical feasibility in specific working context as well as time and financial aspects are criticized. Present research shows that nonformal and informal learning should be better linked in order to develop teachers\\u2019 digital competences sustainably.

This is especially crucial in the vocational education context, which is closer to the world of work and, therefore, more sensitive to the disruptive changes of digitalisation. This chapter addresses this issue by proposing the result of a project that aimed to identify a new professional profile in the context of dual vocational education in Switzerland. The Digital Facilitator is a new term that refers to a teacher with advanced digital competency who is an expert in facilitating digital innovation adoption within educational institutions. Thus, it constitutes a possible concrete way to address the issue of integrating the individual and the organisational perspectives related to digital transformation. The profile is discussed by presenting an analysis of acknowledged existing frameworks and by considering the specificities of the context in which it was developed. The opportunities and challenges associated with introducing the profile are also critically addressed.\",\"published_in\":\"Digital Transformation of Learning Organizations 2021 p. 169-187\",\"year\":\"2021-01-06\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital skills; Competence profile; Vocational education; Teacher education; School digital transformation\",\"subject\":\"Digital skills; Competence profile; Vocational education; Teacher education; School digital transformation\",\"authors\":\"Cattaneo, Alberto A.

Pre-service teachers' perceptions of digital citizenship and their patterns of knowledge of digital citizenship were explored. Background This study examines the concepts of digital citizenship, including digital communication, digital rights \\/ responsibilities, critical thinking, digital participation, digital security, digital skills, digital ethics, and digital commerce, of pre-service teachers and their interaction with instructional technology. This research study will inform policies and strategies to enhance teacher trainings and education in Turkey. Methodology A mixed methodology of data sources including a survey and open-ended questions were collected to explore pre-service teachers' perceptions of digital citizenship. The Digital Citizenship Scale was used as the quantitative data collection instrument. Various statistical techniques and tests such as ANOVA, t-Test, and Tukey HSD were used in the analysis of the data. Contribution This study contributes to existing literature knowledge by demonstrating the patterns of digital citizenship that influence Turkish pre-service teachers' professional development and deepening the discussion of change in policies and strategies in education programs in Turkey. Findings Results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference of digital citizenship scores of male and female pre-service teachers with male participants scoring higher than female participants. However, participants' mean scores did not significantly differentiate by their departments. Similarly, it was observed that participants' mean scores did not significantly differentiate by the high school types. As far as parent educational background was concerned, the mean scores of the participants did not indicate a significant difference by the education level of the mother, but the scores differed significantly by the father's education level. Similar responses emerged in the open-ended questions. Participants expressed that they felt competent in digital communication and digital participation and their parents are partly influential in the improvement of these skills. In addition, the majority of the participants stated that the major they enrolled did not have any contribution to their digital skills so far. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for practitioners to include in their teacher education programs training pre-service teachers to become digital citizens. Recommendations for Researchers Recommendations for researchers to include identifying practical activities that enhance pre-service teachers' digital citizenship skills. Impact on Society The findings and results of this study will help display a universal digital citizenship model for pre-service and veteran teachers in Turkey as well as to strengthen their interaction with instructional and information technologies through policy and strategy changes in educational settings. Future Research Further studies should be undertaken, especially in developing countries. Future research can further explore pre-service teachers' perceptions of digital citizenship such as digital rights, responsibilities, and ethics as well as evaluating the opinions of school administrators, students, and parents regarding their perceptions of digital citizenship in educational settings.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital Citizenship; Pre-Service Primary School Teachers; Digital Technologies; Internet\",\"subject\":\"Digital Citizenship; Pre-Service Primary School Teachers; Digital Technologies; Internet\",\"authors\":\"Ata, Ridvan; Yildirim, Kasim\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12809\\/1172\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"946d902bd29bffc6268ebcc633986bd2c80db1319b32307ac9ba6959ca002178\",\"relevance\":236,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"0eabe4f75d5c2cdf7b6493d022148293e823209d96ef60152b7558f118bdc103\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.20368\\/1971-8829\\/1068; http:\\/\\/www.je-lks.org\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/Je-LKS_EN\\/article\\/view\\/1068\",\"title\":\"Evaluations to the gamification effectiveness of digital game-based adventure education course -- GILT\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study aimed to design a digital game-based adventure education (GILT) course for team-building purposes.

It promotes equitable access to digital information or digital knowledge resources. The digital divide among the developed and developing countries, rich and poor, educated and uneducated remains a hindrance in the society for dissemination of information or learning resources to great extent. National Education Policy 2020 emphasized on extensive use of technology in education and addressed reducing the digital divide for maximum dissemination of digital education. With the advancement of information technology, there is the rapid creation of new knowledge. The Digital Explosion of knowledge domains is increasing significantly faster in the 21st-centuryglobal world where we are connected by technology. However, the digital divide poses great threats to sustainable development goals; specifically goal number four quality education and goal number ten reduced inequalities and social inclusion. Nevertheless, somehow many countries especially developing countries like India, fail to achieve sustainable development goals to many extents. The present paper attempts to explore the issues and concerns of the digital divide in the higher education ecosystem in the Indian context. It also reflects on the extent of e-inclusion and the digital divide especially in the teaching-learning system and how the majority of the people in our society will come under the purview of the e-inclusion ecosystem so far as higher education is concerned. This paper also provides an overview of different digital divides, issues, and Government initiatives taken to bridge the gap and digitally empower the learner, especially in higher education\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital divide, E-Inclusion, Sustainable Development Goals, Digital Information; http\\/\\/www.sxcepatna.edu.in\\/b_jrearc.html\",\"subject\":\"Digital divide, E-Inclusion, Sustainable Development Goals, Digital Information; http\\/\\/www.sxcepatna.edu.in\\/b_jrearc.html\",\"authors\":\"Prasenjit Roy\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.6393264\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"83d272438e6bec2f9e7dd8a82e5a3873a0e4a3efcbefe8b8f2220ef5fd204de2\",\"relevance\":219,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.6393264\"},{\"id\":\"91c11d5d784b94ce95b33af160abf917163aa56264479cdf9d7610376d7ce7cd\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.oslomet.no\\/index.php\\/seminar\\/article\\/view\\/4254; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1504-4831; doi:10.7577\\/seminar.4254; 1504-4831; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9f781dd748184e65b9a6ae61abee3960\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7577\\/seminar.4254; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9f781dd748184e65b9a6ae61abee3960\",\"title\":\"Global Education Industry - Exploring the state of affairs in Austria\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Digitization initiatives in the field of education always correspond with developments in the education industry. In recent years, globally networked development dynamics have emerged that are essentially characterized by an education-industrial complex and are also relevant in Austria. While on the one hand the corona-induced developmental boosts of 'digital' education are welcomed, especially in edtech contexts, on the other hand the international discourses on the problematic role of the global education industry can no longer be ignored.

Adaptation of education processes both in kindergartens and universities is related with readiness of teachers for implementation of digital technologies into education process. The significance of their use in education is accompanied by numerous questions regarding elimination of negative influence of digital content on a forming developing person, on their rational and reasonable application at early stages of social and personal development of preschool children. The conceptual field of pedagogy is supplemented by new categories: digital education, digital education environment, digital competence. This article presents results of teachers\\u2019 surveying on the issue of readiness to designing information environment and attitude to the digital technologies implemented into education. On the one hand, the teachers highlighted advantages of the applied information technologies: individual education, possibility to master the program by preschool children and to consolidate knowledge and skills in the case of prolonged absence from studies, time saving, mobility and flexibility of education. On the other hand, the teachers mentioned the main drawbacks of the use of digital technologies: possible harm for health of children, inability of full development of speech, communication skills, development of gaming activity. The main problems preventing active use of modern technologies are comprised of low digital competence of university graduates and working teachers; age features of preschool children, which do not allow to study material without assistance by adults; the lack of opportunities of pupil\\u2019s parents to actively participate in educational activity of preschool entity.\",\"published_in\":\"SHS Web of Conferences, Vol 98, p 05028 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"digitalization of education; tutors; preschool education; education environment; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"digitalization of education; tutors; preschool education; education environment; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Zakharova Larisa; Andrianova Yelena; Silakova Marina; Subbotina Yekaterina\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1051\\/shsconf\\/20219805028\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"247dd21c7eba6c2d78026ead70c41cf1d304d30afb8f10c2b2af653ac1b164f2\",\"relevance\":216,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1051\\/shsconf\\/20219805028\"},{\"id\":\"eb6fefb5e57764cffd8504a5424e49695f5bbaebbb4aa5cc3be4b99ec877d1e4\",\"relation\":\"Frontiers in Education;January 2022 %7C Volume 6 %7C Article 784701; https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/articles\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2021.784701\\/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Fronti; urn:issn:2504-284X; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2980954; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2021.784701; cristin:1980881\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2980954; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2021.784701\",\"title\":\"The Digital Transformation of Higher Education Teaching: Four Pedagogical Prescriptions to Move Active Learning Pedagogy Forward\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Digital learning technologies are expected to reform higher education: The recent Digital Education Action Plan (2021\\u20132027) of the European Commission (EC) states that digital education should facilitate more personalised, flexible, and student-centred teaching (European Commission, 2021). This places great demands on university teachers, whose technological skills have long been considered the most formidable barrier to the digital transformation of higher education (B\\u00f8rte et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a steep technological learning curve among higher education teachers. Overnight, university teachers were forced to adapt their teaching to a digital, online format to meet the needs of more than 1.5 billion students across the globe who have been affected by COVID-19 restrictions (UNESCO, 2021). Despite a great willingness to change, over a year into the pandemic, the frustration among (university) teachers has become apparent. A United Kingdom survey found that higher education teachers thought that their pedagogical practis had been \\u201creduced to the fulfilment of rudimentary technical functions\\u201d and that they played more of a transmissionist pedagogical role (Watermeyer et al., 2020). Taking the perspective of the students, recent survey data from Norwegian higher education shows that, during the pandemic, lack of motivation and sense of loneliness have been an increasing problem among students (NOKUT the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education, 2020). From this we learn that a fully digital approach in higher education has limitations both when it comes to pedagogical practices and students\\u2019 well-being. ; publishedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"784701 ; Frontiers in Education ; 6 ; 1-6\",\"year\":\"2022-01-14T08:16:16Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital education; Educational technology; Pedagogy; Blended learning; Active learning pedagogy\",\"subject\":\"Digital education; Educational technology; Pedagogy; Blended learning; Active learning pedagogy\",\"authors\":\"R\\u00f8e, Yngve; Wojniusz, Slawomir; Bjerke, Annette Hessen\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2980954\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"eb6fefb5e57764cffd8504a5424e49695f5bbaebbb4aa5cc3be4b99ec877d1e4\",\"relevance\":215,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"863206dcdbafef366a47987db957b723bf4c8652d9deab5249d41d2ca853bbe4\",\"relation\":\"International Journal of Inclusive Education;; https:\\/\\/www.tandfonline.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1080\\/13603116.2021.1937344; International Journal of Inclusive Education. 2021, .; urn:issn:1360-3116; urn:issn:1464-5173; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2834337; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/13603116.2021.1937344; cristin:1916314\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2834337; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/13603116.2021.1937344\",\"title\":\"Increasing faculty\\u2019s competence in digital accessibility for inclusive education: a systematic literature review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The use of information and communications technology (ICT) in higher education institutions has increased in the past 20 years. While ICT has brought many benefits to students and faculty, research shows that it also creates barriers and challenges for students with disabilities due to the inaccessibility of digital tools and learning materials.

This systematic literature review aims to study existing work on increasing the faculty members\\u2019 competence in providing accessible and inclusive digital learning materials and environments to students in higher education. Sixteen peer-reviewed papers were included and analysed. Most trainings included topics on disability and awareness, legislation, and methods of producing accessible digital materials and providing inclusive digital learning environments. While surveys and interviews were mostly used to evaluate training outcomes, there was a lack of objective data and commonly accepted instrument for evaluation. Good practices and further research opportunities are identified.

Tertiary students, internationally face both opportunities and challenges in learning and adapting to this paradigm shift in the delivery of education. It remains unclear how students in international contexts are responding to these changes in digital learning during and post-COVID-19. This paper aims to compare student perceptions of digital competence, confidence, and resilience in present times using data from surveys of tertiary students from Australia, Cambodia, China, India, and Malaysia. There are disparities not only in the teaching and learning pedagogies amongst these countries but also in the levels of technological advancement, infrastructure support, and pace of digital innovation in the delivery of courses. These differences have put in focus students\\u2019 both digital competencies and resilience as they pursue higher education on various digital learning platforms. Resilience includes the ability to bounce back or adapt from stress (Smith et al., 2008) Digital resilience is students\\u2019 tech-savviness and preparedness to adapt to different digital environments as they pursue higher education. This paper examines the perceptions of tertiary undergraduate students from these countries in this emerging new digital learning norm-. A total of 687 tertiary students from the aforementioned countries participated in a survey to questions related to digital competence, confidence in using and\\/or adapting to digital innovation, and resilience. Statistically significant attributes are identified to help better understand the challenges these culturally diverse students perceive in digital learning environments. This study will reveal barriers that impact the digital transformation of undergraduate students which can be used to recommend necessary teaching and learning support frameworks to enhance their digital competence and resilience. This will help tertiary institutions better equip all stakeholders in adapting to the new normal of higher education in the future.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of University Teaching & Learning Practice\",\"year\":\"2021-08-23T08:25:19Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital competencies; Digital resilience; Digital technology; COVID-19\",\"subject\":\"Digital competencies; Digital resilience; Digital technology; \",\"authors\":\"Eri, Rajaraman; Gudimetla, Prasad; Star, Shaun; Rowlands, Josh; Girgla, Anit; To, Loeurt; Li, Fan; Sochea, Nhem; Bindal, Umesh\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ro.uow.edu.au\\/jutlp\\/vol18\\/iss5\\/7\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"c08527b37e79a957937838a8cd626cd4be9ba14af45e48e3859db45039081dd4\",\"relevance\":195,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"20f59ea4469528609a7a0f8557502b8b286e7d0a4758f5575a8847b1723d5554\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/philosopheducation.com\\/index.php\\/philed\\/article\\/view\\/611; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2309-1606; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2616-7662; 2309-1606; 2616-7662; doi:10.31874\\/2309-1606-2020-26-1-1; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b4b3281a55cf43e981746f40cc67e766\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.31874\\/2309-1606-2020-26-1-1; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b4b3281a55cf43e981746f40cc67e766\",\"title\":\"Homo Digitalis, Digital culture and Digital Education: Explorations of Philosophical Anthropology and of Philosophy of Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The article presents an analysis of reflections of the Western philosophical anthropology and anthropological oriented philosophy of education upon the digital culture as a new stage of the mass culture development inherited from industrial society.

The orientation function of the concept \\u201chomo digitalis\\u201d is unveiled, which is wide-spread using in the West-European, especially in Germany, and in the provocative philosophy of education. The ideal-typically construct of the human as the creation and the creator of the digital culture explains the distinctiveness of the communications in the space of this culture which is represented generally as a visual culture making provocation on purpose making close of the traditional writing culture. There is settling a comparative analyze of human figures created of the different generations of the German philosophical anthropology with accentuating on the semantics of homo digitalis, homo faber and homo creator which are partly complementary. The spatially and temporally characteristics of the digital culture are described, its forms of the communication are explicating in their singularity where the phatic communication predominates and risks of the digital alienation exists. The digital culture changes the self-recognition of the post-industrial societies which need world-view and moral orientation including expertly moral evaluation that is necessary for the prevention of the modernization risks.

By bringing together some of the emerging changes in education governance, in this article we argue for a new constitution of governance, precision education governance. Precision education governance combines three overlapping and strengthening lines of governance: (i) global governance of education, (ii) marketisation, privatisation and digitalisation, and (iii) behavioural and life sciences as the basis for managing the future education.

As the use of digital resources continue to rise within higher institutions of learning, students are expected to develop the required digital literacy skills. Digital literacy skill is a basic requirement for students to function effectively in the information society, which is experiencing a paradigm shift from print resources to digital resources. Hence, digital literacy skill becomes very important since the use of digital resources depend on the competences in using digital resources. In the fast-growing knowledge society, information literacy has become one of the most important skills. This is because students with research information needs will most likely use digital resources if they have the skills required for their effective usage. Whilst information literacy seems to be a term that is mostly associated with higher education, its application to digital resources is yet to be widely exploited. In order to foster the development of digital literacy skills through institutional curriculum, this study explores the dimensional constructs of digital literacy with the aim of having students who can use digital tools to advance learning and keeping up with changing technologies as well as become global digital citizens. The dimensional constructs of digital literacy as outlined in this study are important in the use of digital resources because of the proliferation of digital information presently experienced due to a series of developmental digital activities in our world.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"Dimensional constructs -- higher education; Digital literacy; skills-- higher education\",\"subject\":\"Dimensional constructs; higher education; Digital literacy; skills-- higher education\",\"authors\":\"Odede, Israel R.; Jiyane, Glenrose V.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10530\\/1860\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"b0d071e1cb96125c75d45ea57fca59eda4c7ea9d6a3883084b58bfe4dfbe2e82\",\"relevance\":179,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"6efefb972f3e7f3a6deee87d4a3f1f4ec59348ab4ecd51b88d4c54bb8cae4ed3\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.19173\\/irrodl.v17i5.2566; http:\\/\\/www.irrodl.org\\/index.php\\/irrodl\\/article\\/viewFile\\/2566\\/3887; http:\\/\\/www.irrodl.org\\/index.php\\/irrodl\\/article\\/viewFile\\/2566\\/3904; http:\\/\\/www.irrodl.org\\/index.php\\/irrodl\\/article\\/viewFile\\/2566\\/3908; http:\\/\\/www.irrodl.org\\/index.php\\/irrodl\\/article\\/viewFile\\/2566\\/3909\",\"title\":\"Digital Curation as a Core Competency in Current Learning and Literacy: A Higher Education Perspective\",\"paper_abstract\":\"&lt;p class=\\\"3\\\"&gt;Digital curation may be regarded as a core competency in higher education since it contributes to establishing a sense of metaliteracy (an essential requirement for optimally functioning in a modern media environment) among students. Digital curation is gradually finding its way into higher education curricula aimed at fostering social media literacies. Teachers are urged to blend informal and formal learning and since most people informally use curation in their daily lives for compiling relevant information, it may be fairly easy to adopt digital curation in teaching and learning. Teachers, however, require considerable insight in incorporating various informal digital curation tools in educational practices. The SECTIONS model may assist in guiding decisions around the suitability of digital curation tools for a higher education environment. Including digital literacy training in the professional development of academic staff members may sensitize them to the possibilities that incorporating digital approaches in curricula offer. The Five Cs of Digital Curation framework may guide academic staff members in compiling suitable digital material. There as yet appears not to be a pedagogy that fully acknowledges the various digital curation processes. A pedagogy of abundance, acknowledging that content often is freely available and abundant, may eventually prove relevant in this regard.&lt;\\/p&gt;\",\"published_in\":\"The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning ; volume 17, issue 5 ; ISSN 1492-3831\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education\",\"subject\":\"Education\",\"authors\":\"Ungerer, Leona M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.19173\\/irrodl.v17i5.2566\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"6efefb972f3e7f3a6deee87d4a3f1f4ec59348ab4ecd51b88d4c54bb8cae4ed3\",\"relevance\":175,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.19173\\/irrodl.v17i5.2566\"},{\"id\":\"94772f6b0f7a3518c0d7f18c520c786dc924e49023eb585900585df2f39af0fe\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ijem.com\\/\\/IJEM_5_3_465.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2469-9632; 2469-9632; doi:10.12973\\/ijem.5.3.465; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7217663407b145ef8a4684cefedf1726\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.12973\\/ijem.5.3.465; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7217663407b145ef8a4684cefedf1726\",\"title\":\"Social Studies Teacher Candidates\\u2019 Perception of Digital Citizenship\",\"paper_abstract\":\"With the rapid pace of technological and digital change, the use of mass communication and digital communication tools, and internet usage have become very prevalent and thus digital citizenship education has become a necessity for individuals so that they can effectively use these technologies.

However, this kind of educational activity is limited by several factors such as transportation, time and space, etc., which result in several defects such as limited visiting efficiency, lacks of evaluation for teaching achievements etc. To solve these problems, we put forward a countermeasure program of digital museums towards second classroom for primary and secondary school students. First, we analyzed the studies of second classroom based on the digital museums both in China and other countries.

These include a lack of clear categorization of digital health education in the literature; constantly evolving concepts, pedagogies, or theories; and a multitude of methods, features, technologies, or delivery settings. The Digital Health Education Collaboration was established to evaluate the evidence on digital education in health professions; inform policymakers, educators, and students; and ultimately, change the way in which these professionals learn and are taught. The aim of this paper is to present the overarching methodology that we use to synthesize evidence across our digital health education reviews and to discuss challenges related to the process. For our research, we followed Cochrane recommendations for the conduct of systematic reviews; all reviews are reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidance. This included assembling experts in various digital health education fields; identifying gaps in the evidence base; formulating focused research questions, aims, and outcome measures; choosing appropriate search terms and databases; defining inclusion and exclusion criteria; running the searches jointly with librarians and information specialists; managing abstracts; retrieving full-text versions of papers; extracting and storing large datasets, critically appraising the quality of studies; analyzing data; discussing findings; drawing meaningful conclusions; and drafting research papers. The approach used for synthesizing evidence from digital health education trials is commonly regarded as the most rigorous benchmark for conducting systematic reviews. Although we acknowledge the presence of certain biases ingrained in the process, we have clearly highlighted and minimized those biases by strictly adhering to scientific rigor, methodological integrity, and standard operating procedures. This paper will be a valuable asset for researchers and methodologists undertaking systematic reviews in digital health education. ; Public Health and primary care ; Prevention, Population and Disease management (PrePoD)\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Medical Internet Research\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"methods; education; medical; systematic reviews; evidence-based; distance; professional\",\"subject\":\"methods; education; medical; systematic reviews; evidence-based; distance; professional\",\"authors\":\"Car, J.; Carlstedt-Duke, J.; Car, L.T.; Posadzki, P.; Whiting, P.; Zary, N.; Atun, R.; Majeed, A.; Campbell, J.; Digital Hlth Educ Collaboration\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1887\\/3195239\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"713ecda02e296b1e792349ac678bcb8a47e7783125481f90db2f001fa7dd5f39\",\"relevance\":134,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"35ce8eb1f232e10bea8c7516ccb5344dfbf5b0df8c22ff21278872371c51ff1f\",\"relation\":\"Globalisation, Societies and Education Vol. 16, Issue 1, p. 49-65; 10.1080\\/14767724.2017.1356701\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.13\\/1404922\",\"title\":\"#Eduresistance: a critical analysis of the role of digital media in collective struggles for public education in the USA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"From Facebook-coordinated high-school walkouts to compelling Internet-based protest art that has accompanied recent teacher strikes, grassroots education activism in the USA has gone digital. Despite the proliferation of research on the mediatisation of education policy, few studies have explored the ways in which activists for public education engage with Web 2.0 technologies. This paper makes a contribution to this under-researched area by exploring selected activist accounts including Parents Across America, United Opt Out National, and the PS 2013 campaign in New York City. I draw on critical, feminist, and cultural studies theories of education and social movement media to analyse activist media practices in a policy and political milieu dominated by corporate media and neoliberal governance structures. The analysis reveals that progressive education activists strategically deploy digital media to amplify voice, build collective identity, and disseminate alternative knowledge to enable direct action.

The aim of this study is to discuss its effectiveness as a strategy for developing Media Education. The 16 activities we have collected are mostly targeted at the school population and show an emphasis on media production, a dimension that is often not considered part of formal learning, which is more focused on reading than on writing. The results lead us to raise questions about the importance of non-formal education. Interestingly, most of these initiatives have been designed to take place in the school context and are, in various ways, supported by the Ministry of Education, a situation which blurs the boundaries between formal and non-formal learning. The analysis of the data leads us to this specific recommendation: these initiatives should be formally evaluated in order to understand their real impact on the acquisition of news media education skills. ; ESF -European Science Foundation(SFRH\\/BPD\\/92204\\/2013) ; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/publishedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"Media education; Digital literacy; Competitions; Formal; Non-formal; Education; Formal and non-formal education; Ci\\u00eancias Sociais::Ci\\u00eancias da Comunica\\u00e7\\u00e3o\",\"subject\":\"Media education; Digital literacy; Competitions; Formal; Non-formal; Education; Formal and non-formal education;\",\"authors\":\"Pereira, Lu\\u00eds; Jorge, Ana; Brites, Maria Jos\\u00e9\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1822\\/45250\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"de8a1bbe7dbd026032bf02f6439ecd5beaa3cc32d50f237845b6ff3ae12bfce6\",\"relevance\":132,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"00da13326286b08d72bdcdfd357690e1dc29aa309a09c151fc83ba40a1db9720\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/1910666; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2146-5967; 2146-5967; doi:10.5961\\/jhes.2021.475; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6bd9b952bfa84f219dcc30c846385abe\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5961\\/jhes.2021.475; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6bd9b952bfa84f219dcc30c846385abe\",\"title\":\"The Mediating Role of Attitude towards Distance Education in the Effect of Digital Literacy Level on Satisfaction with Distance Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study aims to examine whether the attitudes towards distance education have a mediating role in the effect of academicians\\u2019 digital literacy levels on their satisfaction with distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a postdigital era, blurred boundaries between digital technologies and physical reality place new demands on citizenship, teacher education institutions (TEIs), and teacher educators (TEDs). This paper explores Swedish TEDs\\u2019 views of digital citizenship and the professional digital competence (PDC) required for teaching subject student teachers to teach for digital citizenship. Seven TEIs participated and 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted with TEDs teaching a Core Education Subjects module on education and democracy mandatory for all student teachers. TEDs generally believe that the digitalization of society impacts the democratic assignment and addressing this requires specific PDC. Conceptualizations of digital citizenship tend to foreground source criticism as well as ethical, safe, and sound use of digital technologies, and to some degree also (im-)material means of democratic participation. While generally believing that TE should address questions relating to digital citizenship and that TEDs have an important role in this regard, digital technologies are discussed in the module coincidentally and TEDs are unsure to what degree student teachers receive such training. Challenges include lack of time and unclear Degree Objectives. To develop TEDs\\u2019 PDC to include questions relating to digital citizenship in their teaching, support is needed through policy and continuous professional development for TEDs, including reviews of course content and program structure. Future TE research needs to explore digital citizenship in the school subject social studies.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital citizenship; Professional digital competence; Teacher education; Postdigital; Democratic assignment; Pedagogical Work; Pedagogiskt arbete\",\"subject\":\"Digital citizenship; Professional digital competence; Teacher education; Postdigital; Democratic assignment; Pedagogical Work; Pedagogiskt arbete\",\"authors\":\"\\u00d6rtegren, Alex\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/urn.kb.se\\/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:umu:diva-192591\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"e217b9ddb0feb0bf2195eada7a85c334d820e8830ed607a618e0ceb11d15a395\",\"relevance\":118,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"968edb56a18cfd1b502160c8c54f59418c09eb1cfbcdc05c5ef9ce1e2aff3966\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/repository.uki.ac.id\\/4927\\/1\\/PrintvsDigitalReadingComprehensioninEFL.pdf; Pardede, Parlindungan (2019) Print vs Digital Reading Comprehension in EFL.

Previous research has highlighted limitations in technological access in rural areas and the importance of mobile phones for transitions. Whilst universities offer wide-ranging digital support, there remains a tendency towards universalist mechanisms. Drawing on a longitudinal study across three universities, and employing Holland\\u2019s theory of figured worlds, we highlight rural students\\u2019 experiences of digital transitions across different cultural worlds, prior to university and once they arrive, including the bewildering technocratic systems and practices and resulting conflicts and positionings encountered.

These technological transformations have the ability to deepen, enrich, and adaptively guide learning and interaction, but they also hold potential risks for neglecting people's affective learning processes\\u2014that is, learners' emotional experiences and expressions in learning. We argue that technologies and their usage in particular should be designed with the goal of enhancing learning and interaction that acknowledges both fundamental aspects of learning: cognitive and affective. In our empirical research, we have explored the possibility of using various types of emerging digital tools as individual and group support for cognitively effortful and affectively meaningful learning. We present four case studies of experiments dealing with social networking systems, programming with computer games, and \\u201cmakers culture\\u201d and digital fabrication as examples of digital education. All these experiments investigate novel ways of technological integration in learning by focusing on their affective potential. In the first study, a social networking system was used in a higher education context for providing a forum for online learning. The second study demonstrates a Minecraft experiment as game-based learning in primary school education. Finally, the third and the fourth case study showcases examples of \\u201cmaker\\u201d contexts and digital fabrication in early education and in secondary school. It is concluded that digital systems and tools can provide multiple opportunities for affective learning in different contexts within different age groups. As a pedagogical implication, scaffolding in both cognitive and affective learning processes is necessary in order to make the learning experience with emerging digital tools meaningful and engaging.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Education, Vol 4 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"affective learning; collaborative learning; digital education; digital fabrication; maker education; social networking systems; Education (General); L7-991\",\"subject\":\"affective learning; collaborative learning; digital education; digital fabrication; maker education; social networking systems; \",\"authors\":\"Piia N\\u00e4ykki; Jari Laru; Essi Vuopala; Pirkko Siklander; Sanna J\\u00e4rvel\\u00e4\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2019.00128\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"347dfd1a5b63ec2b7ba074eb3471f5103f00c63e35c8dbfdae1245adedac92a2\",\"relevance\":112,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/feduc.2019.00128\"},{\"id\":\"2bd2720ac96289b21d6d50ea9d3406425645ec550f74f07de7b03e696e2c1296\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2227-7102\\/11\\/8\\/402; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2227-7102; doi:10.3390\\/educsci11080402; 2227-7102; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5e5e42d35980413f9692388980b7f059\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/educsci11080402; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5e5e42d35980413f9692388980b7f059\",\"title\":\"Digital Competence Assessment Methods in Higher Education: A Systematic Literature Review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The rapid increase in recent years in the number of different digital competency frameworks, models, and strategies has prompted an increasing popularity for making the argument in favor of the need to evaluate and assess digital competence. To support the process of digital competence assessment, it is consequently necessary to understand the different approaches and methods. This paper carries out a systematic literature review and includes an analysis of the existing proposals and conceptions of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education, with the aim of better understanding the field of research. The review follows three objectives: (i) describe the characteristics of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education; (ii) provide an overview of current trends; and, finally, (iii) identify challenges and issues in digital competence assessment in higher education with a focus on the reliability and validity of the proposed methods. On the basis of the findings, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital competence assessment in higher education requires more attention, with a specific focus on instrument validity and reliability. Furthermore, it will be of great importance to further investigate the use of assessment tools to support systematic digital competence assessment processes. The analysis includes possible opportunities and ideas for future lines of work in digital competence evaluation in higher education.\",\"published_in\":\"Education Sciences, Vol 11, Iss 402, p 402

The major dimensions of open education enabled by digital affordances are elaborated, and their contribution to development acknowledged.

Today education is realised by means of digital technologies, and art creativity involves digital media. This model adds variety to the forms of training of art specialists. The author of the paper studies the educational value and requirements, existing problems and strategies of introducing digital technologies to the field of art education. : \\u041d\\u0430\\u0443\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0435 \\u043c\\u043d\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435, \\u0412\\u044b\\u043f\\u0443\\u0441\\u043a 10 2018, Pages 97-102\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u0446\\u0438\\u0444\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u044b\\u0435 \\u043c\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438\\u0430; \\u0445\\u0443\\u0434\\u043e\\u0436\\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0435 \\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435; \\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u044b\\u0435 \\u043c\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438\\u0430; digital media; art education; new media\",\"subject\":\"\\u0446\\u0438\\u0444\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u044b\\u0435 \\u043c\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438\\u0430; \\u0445\\u0443\\u0434\\u043e\\u0436\\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0435 \\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435; \\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u044b\\u0435 \\u043c\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438\\u0430; digital media; art education; new media\",\"authors\":\"\\u0412\\u0430\\u043d, \\u0415.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.25807\\/pbh.22224378.2018.10.97.102\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"d2ae6317c05bcb129cd8a7bee2373e113dfa1520db339d7e49ea60be5a92515a\",\"relevance\":91,\"resulttype\":[\"Text\",\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.25807\\/pbh.22224378.2018.10.97.102\"},{\"id\":\"d61f66ea6456a9c053598b9161d1fc2683f96ec7bae4fbaa8adde45f67dba495\",\"relation\":\"Digitization of education as a key characteristic of modernity \\/ V.

The Digital Sabbath and Digital Distraction exhibition results from a creative arts research project involving graduate art teachers and art education lecturers who communicate well visually. The project followed the experiences of nine participants (including the researchers) as they gave up access to digital technologies for a day a week over a three-month period, a practice known as Digital Sabbath (DS). The participants\\u2019 narratives (artefacts, journals and interviews) formed the stimulus for visualisations of the Digital Sabbath experience after a pre-intervention survey. Each researcher developed a series of works with participants, documenting the nature of their experiences and affective responses to the process. The researchers are creating a large collaborative piece that documents general themes from the project experience. The artworks produced for this research aim to communicate the findings of the research with a broader audience, and to incite discussion around our use of technology and its effect on our lives. For many participants, the practice was incredibly difficult and small interactions with technology were often discussed as \\u2018necessary\\u2019.

In 2006, the European Union defined digital competence as one of eight key competences for lifelong learning. The terms digital literacies and digital competence have since been used interchangeably, particularly in policy documents concerning education and the digitalization of educational systems and teaching. However, whether these concepts carry similar meanings, and are understood in a similar way, across languages and cultures is not self-evident. By taking the curricula in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway as examples, this article attempts to clarify similarities and differences in how the concepts are interpreted, as well as what implications this has for the digitalization of education. The analyses reveal that different terms are used in the curricula in the different countries, which are connected to themes or interdisciplinary issues to be incorporated into school subjects. The conceptualizations of the terms share a common emphasis on societal issues and a critical approach, highlighting a particular Nordic interpretation of digital literacies and digital competence.\",\"published_in\":\"Media and Communication; Vol 7, No 2 (2019): Critical Perspectives on Digital Literacies: Creating a Path Forward; 25-35 ; 2183-2439\",\"year\":\"2019-06-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"bildung; curricula; digital competence; digital literacies; education; literacy\",\"subject\":\"bildung; curricula; digital competence; digital literacies; education; literacy\",\"authors\":\"Godhe, Anna-Lena\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.cogitatiopress.com\\/mediaandcommunication\\/article\\/view\\/1888\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"e85fc43c429c954a2c9de36893a9f7287432d25ac7a650398868fa2064b948d6\",\"relevance\":78,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"fea30e952cae89fc3c7cef6b10f37577621726b88e3661528149ae4062c13770\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.edubook.com.tw\\/OAtw\\/detail.aspx?no=412655; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1816-5338; doi:10.3966\\/181653382018031301005; 1816-5338; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/31699a7f3c1248639356a5012f482e1f\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3966\\/181653382018031301005; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/31699a7f3c1248639356a5012f482e1f\",\"title\":\"10.3966\\/181653382018031301005\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u6280\\u8853\\u63a8\\u52d5\\u4e86\\u5916\\u8a9e\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u6559\\u80b2\\u767c\\u5c55\\uff0c\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\u8005\\u7684\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u80fd\\u529b\\u5df2\\u6210\\u70ba\\u4e8c\\u5341\\u4e00\\u4e16\\u7d00\\u516c\\u6c11\\u5fc5\\u5099\\u6280\\u80fd\\u4e4b\\u4e00\\u3002\\u4f9d\\u64da\\u8a2d\\u8a08\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\u7406\\u8ad6\\u53ca\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u7406\\u8ad6\\uff0c\\u672c\\u7814\\u7a76\\u5f9e\\u8ab2\\u7a0b\\u76ee\\u6a19\\u3001\\u6559\\u5b78\\u6cd5\\u548c\\u8a55\\u4f30\\u6a19\\u6e96\\u5c64\\u9762\\u69cb\\u5efa\\u4e86\\u5916\\u8a9e\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u6559\\u5b78\\u6a21\\u5f0f\\uff0c\\u4e26\\u7d93\\u7531\\u6df1\\u5ea6\\u8a2a\\u8ac7\\u5c0d\\u5916\\u8a9e\\u6559\\u5e2b\\u548c\\u7b2c\\u4e8c\\u8a9e\\u8a00\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\u8005\\u9032\\u884c\\u8ab2\\u7a0b\\u9700\\u6c42\\u5206\\u6790\\u3002\\u672c\\u7814\\u7a76\\u8a8d\\u70ba\\uff1a\\u4e00\\u3001\\u7576\\u524d\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u4efb\\u52d9\\u8a2d\\u8a08\\u7684\\u96e3\\u9ede \\u5728\\u65bc\\u8ab2\\u7a0b\\u6574\\u5408\\u554f\\u984c\\u3002\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u8ab2\\u7a0b\\u8a2d\\u7f6e\\u61c9\\u6253\\u901a\\u8ab2\\u5167\\u53ca\\u8ab2\\u5916\\u5169\\u985e\\u8cc7\\u6e90\\uff0c\\u5145\\u5206\\u9ad4\\u73fe\\u8a9e\\u8a00\\u6587\\u5316\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\u548c\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8cc7\\u6e90\\u4f7f\\u7528\\u7684\\u6709\\u6a5f\\u7d50\\u5408\\uff0c\\u5f15\\u5c0e\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\u8005\\u7d93\\u7531\\u878d\\u5408\\u3001\\u4e92\\u52d5\\u548c\\u591a\\u6a21\\u614b\\u9032\\u884c\\u81ea\\u4e3b\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\u548c\\u5408\\u4f5c\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\uff0c\\u6700\\u7d42\\u5be6\\u73fe\\u8ab2\\u7a0b\\u8cc7\\u6e90\\u512a\\u5316\\u914d\\u7f6e\\uff1b\\u4e8c\\u3001\\u8ab2\\u5802\\u6559\\u5b78\\u9700\\u4f9d\\u8a17\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8a9e\\u5883\\u958b\\u5c55\\u5be6\\u8e10\\u6d3b\\u52d5\\uff0c\\u6559\\u5e2b\\u7d93\\u7531\\u660e\\u78ba\\u5316\\u6307\\u5c0e\\u548c\\u6279\\u5224\\u5f0f\\u6559\\u5b78\\uff0c\\u9f13\\u52f5\\u5b78\\u7fd2\\u8005\\u5c07\\u65b0\\u7684\\u77e5\\u8b58\\u9077\\u79fb\\u81f3\\u6578 \\u4f4d\\u8a9e\\u5883\\uff0c\\u767c\\u63ee\\u591a\\u5a92\\u9ad4\\u7684\\u4fc3\\u5b78\\u6548\\u679c\\uff1b\\u4e09\\u3001\\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u7e3e\\u6548\\u8a55\\u4f30\\u61c9\\u540c\\u6642\\u517c\\u9867\\u8a9e\\u8a00\\u76ee\\u6a19\\u3001\\u8a0a\\u606f\\u76ee\\u6a19\\u3001\\u6280\\u8853\\u76ee\\u6a19\\u548c\\u95dc\\u4fc2\\u76ee\\u6a19\\u7684\\u9054\\u6210\\u60c5\\u6cc1\\u3002 Recent advance in digital technology has promoted the development of digital literacy education in foreign languages; learners\\u2019 digital literacy has become one of the essential skills of citizens in the 21st century. Based on the theory of learning by design and digital literacies theory, this study attempts to construct the digital literacies teaching model from the curriculum, instruction and evaluation aspects. It is argued that the difficulty of current digital literacies task design lies on how to handle curriculum integration. Digital literacies courses should make use of digital resources available inside and outside the classroom contexts with reference to the unique features of language and culture. Through curriculum integration, interaction and multi-modal self-learning and cooperative learning, digital resources can be fully utilized. Moreover, classroom teaching should involve digital resources to enhance the language context. With explicit instruction and guidance, teachers should encourage learners to transfer their learning to the digital context. Lastly, evaluators should take into account the achievement of language objectives related to language, information and technology.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Curriculum Studies, Vol 13, Iss 1, Pp 93-109 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u6559\\u5b78\\u6a21\\u5f0f; \\u9700\\u6c42\\u5206\\u6790; \\u8ab2\\u7a0b; \\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u80fd\\u529b; Keywords: teaching model; needs analysis; curriculum; digital literacies; Education; L; Theory and practice of education; LB5-3640\",\"subject\":\"\\u6559\\u5b78\\u6a21\\u5f0f; \\u9700\\u6c42\\u5206\\u6790; \\u8ab2\\u7a0b; \\u6578\\u4f4d\\u8b80\\u5beb\\u80fd\\u529b; Keywords: teaching model; needs analysis; curriculum; digital literacies; Education; L; Theory and practice of education; \",\"authors\":\"\\u738b\\u6a02 Le Wang; \\u9ea5\\u9673\\u6dd1\\u8ce2 Barley Mak\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3966\\/181653382018031301005\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"fea30e952cae89fc3c7cef6b10f37577621726b88e3661528149ae4062c13770\",\"relevance\":77,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3966\\/181653382018031301005\"},{\"id\":\"b1b7b0cb4bf92a7e9e1bd707703a545a518cc64b5329fb88faa521e057b4dce9\",\"relation\":\"Handley, F.J.L.

Digital storytelling, as both a teaching method and a learning resource, has been applied in many innovative ways at all levels of education. Digital storytelling supports student learning and allows teachers to adopt innovative and improved teaching methods. Storytelling is a proven and popular pedagogy, while digital storytelling is relatively recent and still seldom used in the setting of early childhood education. Using a case study of a storytelling\\u2013art\\u2013science club in Jakarta, Indonesia, the researcher explored how and why digital storytelling is used in early childhood education. This club is one of the few organizations that use digital storytelling for teaching and learning programs in early childhood. Data were collected qualitatively using in-depth interviews with four teachers, document analysis, and twice-observations of storytelling activities in each session with 35 and 37 children. The collected data were analyzed using analytical memoing methods. The results indicate that teachers in this club used digital storytelling for several important reasons. They claimed that simple digital technology made storytelling more entertaining, captivating, engaging, communicative and theatrical. This study suggests that the ability of teachers to use digital technology should be enhanced; schools' information and communication technology (ICT) devices should be equipped; some funding should also be allocated by the government to modernize school equipment; while the curriculum should be tailored to meet technological developments, and provide opportunities for children to learn how to make good use of technology.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Child Care and Education Policy, Vol 15, Iss 1, Pp 1-20 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital storytelling; Early childhood education; ICT; Educational technology; Education (General); L7-991; Special aspects of education; LC8-6691\",\"subject\":\"Digital storytelling; Early childhood education; ICT; Educational technology; Special aspects of education; \",\"authors\":\"Maila D.

In particular, it argues that there is an urgent need for the higher education community to develop more sophisticated understandings of the nature of the digital divisions that exist within current cohorts of university students - not least inequalities of \\u00bfeffective' use of ICT to access information and knowledge. With these thoughts in mind, the paper presents a review of recent research and theoretical work in the area of digital exclusion and the digital divide, and considers a number of reasons why digital exclusion remains a complex and entrenched social problem within populations of higher education students. ; Aunque muchos autores ya rechazan con seguridad la noci\\u00f3n de brecha digital, este documento razona que las desigualdades en el uso de las TIC en la educaci\\u00f3n superior contempor\\u00e1nea tienen una importancia creciente en lugar de decreciente.

The use of digital technologies by educators in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is a portal for innovative teaching and learning. While there is a gradual increase in the use of these innovative technologies by HEIs in South Africa, there is still a long way to transform the educational system fully. Effective use of digital technologies in teaching and learning needs a certain level of digital literacy. Digital literacy enhances teaching and learning by helping educators integrate and use digital technologies, while equipping students with skills to access the internet effectively. The impact of digital technology has beaconed the need of educators to acquire 21st-century skills. Digital literacy skills are critical in realising the potential and benefits of digital technologies. This paper investigates the importance of digital technologies in education and the impact of digital literacy skills on the effective use of these technologies in HEIs in South Africa. Data collection was primarily based on a critical review of literature relating to the application of mobile technologies in HEIs in South Africa. The results revealed various barriers inhibiting educators from adopting mobile technologies in teaching and learning, including lack of digital literacy skills, time constraints, unwillingness to change, lack of educator confidence, poor technological infrastructure, and lack of digital or mobile devices. The study provides recommendations to enable and inspire educators in HEIs to use mobile digital technologies effectively.\",\"published_in\":\"Mousaion: South African Journal of Information Studies; Vol. 39 No. 2 (2021); 20 pages ; 2663-659X ; 0027-2639\",\"year\":\"2021-08-31\",\"subject_orig\":\"digital technology; mobile technology; digital literacy skills; higher education institutions; educators\",\"subject\":\"digital technology; mobile technology; digital literacy skills; higher education institutions; educators\",\"authors\":\"Masenya, Tlou Maggie\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.upjournals.co.za\\/index.php\\/LIS\\/article\\/view\\/8428\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"d34aeff8085b89e8dfaf285b2d6d22ac1519670580747fcacb03a750d6005fdb\",\"relevance\":61,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"5c6e05e10a25bd1550354fc8c2819a5e7287404ef0a836c316380491aeb8e6cd\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/urn.fi\\/urn:nbn:fi-fe2021041910821\",\"title\":\"Sustainable design and prototyping using digital fabrication tools for education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Prototyping physical artifacts is a fundamental activity for both product development in industrial and engineering design domains and the development of digital fabrication skills. Prototyping is also essential for human-centric problem-solving in design education. Digital fabrication assists in rapid prototype development through computer-aided design and manufacturing tools. Due to the spread of makerspaces like fabrication laboratories (FabLabs) around the world, the use of digital fabrication tools for prototyping in educational institutes is becoming increasingly common. Studies on the social, environmental, and economic sustainability of digital fabrication have been carried out. However, none of them focus on sustainability and prototyping-based digital fabrication tools or design education. To bridge this research gap, a conceptual framework for sustainable prototyping based on a five-stage design thinking model is proposed. The framework, which is based on a comprehensive literature review of social, economic, and environmental sustainability factors of digital fabrication, is applied to evaluate a prototyping process that took place in a FabLab in an education context aimed at enhancing sustainability. Three case studies are used to evaluate the proposed framework. Based on the findings, recommendations are presented for sustainable prototyping using digital fabrication tools.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"sustainability indicators; prototyping; digital fabrication; design education; FabLab; makerspace\",\"subject\":\"sustainability indicators; prototyping; digital fabrication; design education; FabLab; makerspace\",\"authors\":\"Soomro, S.

Digital technology is largely reshaping the nature of learning in classroom. Digital classroom is one clear manifestation of this emerging trend. There is a burgeoning academic culture of digital classroom today. It is increasingly incomprehensible for the larger academic community to quench their thirst for knowledge without computer technology. The blending of traditional classroom and digital classroom becomes almost imminent. But it is also equally important to understand the inherent merits and demerits of digital classroom. Use of computer technology can enhance the quality of education, but technology alone cannot be sufficient. The basic challenges lie in entrenching the proper use of benefits provided by digital technology. This article seeks to examine the pros and cons of digital classroom along with the major challenges it poses. The methodology applied for this study is explanatory approach. A theoretical-based research, coupled with practical experiences, through critical analysis of existing literatures on digital classroom is carried out.\",\"published_in\":\"Higher Education for the Future ; volume 8, issue 1, page 20-30 ; ISSN 2347-6311 2348-5779\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education\",\"subject\":\"Education\",\"authors\":\"Singh, Mayengbam Nandakishwor\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2347631120980272\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"5071ad41e59cde1031b9e465fb9bf9a95d2c1808d2263171ea731ff7ad61bb53\",\"relevance\":58,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2347631120980272\"},{\"id\":\"4c863c2f28c72867ac40198950afddd7279e1c5cd4f8b7c9635c9e68b8dc1cb2\",\"relation\":\"Archives and Records; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10197\\/9624; 40; 2; 146; 163; doi:10.1080\\/23257962.2018.1425135\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10197\\/9624; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/23257962.2018.1425135\",\"title\":\"Digital curation on a small Island: a study of professional education and training needs in Ireland\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this paper, we use the case study method to understand digital curation knowledge, skills, needs and challenges in Ireland, in order to direct the development of postgraduate digital curation educational programmes. Data was collected in three intervals over a two-year period: a web questionnaire about digital curation knowledge and skills and interest in continuing professional development (CPD); nine interviews with individuals who engaged in digital curation work about workplace challenges and CPD education; and a final online questionnaire about preferences for digital curation CPD education. Findings suggest that Ireland-specific issues emerged: (a) because there is so little understanding about digital curation in Ireland, even among information professionals, individuals were not always sure when they were doing digital curation work and if they needed to learn more and; (b) individuals were often the only ones in their institutions with digital curation skills and found themselves struggling to educate supervisors and colleagues about the necessity of their work as well as the resources needed to conduct their work. Considering these findings, comprehensive postgraduate digital curation education in Ireland would need to include a focus on these issues. ; Archives and Records Association\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-02-28T14:35:28Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Professional development; Archival education; Continuing professional development; Case study\",\"subject\":\"Professional development; Archival education; Continuing professional development; Case study\",\"authors\":\"Cushing, Amber; Shankar, Kalpana\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10197\\/9624\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"4c863c2f28c72867ac40198950afddd7279e1c5cd4f8b7c9635c9e68b8dc1cb2\",\"relevance\":57,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2e9053f7c9a90cf8478b11c2ef0a7d5aafb53c899708e4401ee2177e8b22020a\",\"relation\":\"Australasian Journal of Technology Education; Fox-Turnbull, W.

Digital literacy and resilience are crucial for them to navigate the digital world as much as the real world; however, these remain under-researched subjects, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, the education system has put considerable effort into teaching students these skills to promote quality education as part of the United Nations-defined Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). This issue has proven especially salient amid the COVID\\u221219 pandemic lockdowns, which had obliged most schools to switch to online forms of teaching. This study utilizes a dataset of 1061 Vietnamese students taken from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)\\u2019s \\u201cDigital Kids Asia Pacific (DKAP)\\u201d project and employed Bayesian statistics to explore the relationship between the students\\u2019 background and their digital abilities. Results show that economic status and parents\\u2019 level of education are positively correlated with digital literacy. Students from urban schools have only a slightly higher level of digital literacy than their rural counterparts, suggesting that school location may not be a defining explanatory element in the variation of digital literacy and resilience among Vietnamese students. Students\\u2019 digital literacy and, especially resilience, also have associations with their gender. Moreover, as students are digitally literate, they are more likely to be digitally resilient. Following SDG4, i.e., Quality Education, it is advisable for schools, and especially parents, to seriously invest in creating a safe, educational environment to enhance digital literacy among students.\",\"published_in\":\"Sustainability, Vol 12, Iss 3819, p 3819 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"socio-economic status; parental education; digital literacy; digital resilience; Vietnam; quality education; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350\",\"subject\":\"socio-economic status; parental education; digital literacy; digital resilience; Vietnam; quality education; Environmental effects of industries and plants; Renewable energy sources; Environmental sciences; \",\"authors\":\"Trung Tran; Manh-Toan Ho; Thanh-Hang Pham; Minh-Hoang Nguyen; Khanh-Linh P.

Our daily lives are intertwined with digital technologies like social media, smart-phone, tablets and e-commerce just to name a few. It is worrying that India does not have any world class institution of higher learning and that the key indicators of business education were not encouraging. The world is witnessing knowledge explosion but India is lagging behind in terms of quality and universal education. We are no doubt a great and upcoming nation, that being the position, we have far greater challenges compared to the developed countries. The government is keen to create world-class universities. It must understand that world-class institutes are not created; they evolve over decades and centuries, nurtured by respect for knowledge, policy and adequate funds.

In a separate paper, the authors introduced the Digital Media Literacies Framework, which is composed of three interrelated domains: (1) conceptual, (2) functional, and (3) audiovisual, each of which defines a set of prosumer principles used to create digital artefacts. This framework fills a gap in the literature and is the first step towards the provision of a systematic approach to designing digital media assignments. This paper expands on the Digital Media Literacies Framework through the incorporation of Technological Proxies and proposes a taxonomy of digital media types to help educators and students to visualise the skills needed to complete Learner-Generated Digital Media assignments. A taxonomy of digital media types is presented considering the conceptual, functional, and audiovisual domains of the Digital Media Literacies Framework. The taxonomy spans a range of Learner-Generated Digital Media assignments, from the creation of an audio podcast to the complexity of blended media or game development. Implications of the taxonomy for teaching and learning in higher education are discussed.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"130306 - Educational Technology and Computing; 170103 - Educational Psychology; 930203 - Teaching and Instruction Technologies; digital media; teaching; learning\",\"subject\":\"- Educational Technology and Computing;- Educational Psychology;- Teaching and Instruction Technologies; digital media; teaching; learning\",\"authors\":\"Reyna, Jorge; Hanham, Jose (R15203); Meier, Peter\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2042753017752973\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"aeed3f8f9cd4b991a36dab8d30bb32271bc7e11dae41548f21843190c6fb88cf\",\"relevance\":48,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2042753017752973\"},{\"id\":\"93f9d074de29c8287a2c74c737bf0fff1ecc700629c5be0c5c88e3619a24d16d\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/wos\\/WOS:000504062300004; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/hdl\\/10278\\/3721300; volume:9; issue:1; lastpage:47; numberofpages:18; journal:EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND POLICY; urn:ISSN:2663-5771; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10278\\/3721300; https:\\/\\/www.encatc.org\\/media\\/5141-digital-education-as-a-catalyst-for-museum-transformation.pdf\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10278\\/3721300; https:\\/\\/www.encatc.org\\/media\\/5141-digital-education-as-a-catalyst-for-museum-transformation.pdf\",\"title\":\"Digital education as a catalyst for museum transformation: the case of the\\u201d Museums and New Digital Cultures\\u201d course\",\"paper_abstract\":\"To embrace digital transformation, Continuing Professional Development (CDP) has become a strategic asset.

To investigate this approach, the present small-scale study employs the methods including interviewing and analysing the artefacts of three students selected from a purposive sample on a multimedia course.

Through the analysis of information published on the official Google for Education website, the paper seeks to make visible how this service promotes and reproduces certain ways of talking, thinking about and doing education. The aim is to contribute to a critical discussion of the potential implications of allowing major commercial players to take the lead in the development of digital infrastructure in education. Guiding the analysis is the notion of \\u2018problem\\u2019 understood as central for Google for Education\\u2019s success story. The case of Sweden, in which Google for Education has become widely used, forms the vantage point for this discussion. The study makes visible how Google for Education, in the commercial rhetoric, is constructed as the solution to problem representations by being positioned as a much-needed bridge, in the shape of digital information infrastructure, between digital policy and educational practice. However, Google for Education is far from simply a practical solution to a set of expensive and urgent problems. To uncritically embrace Google as the information infrastructure of education is to hand over power to one actor, which closes doors to alternative paths of doing and knowing in education.\",\"published_in\":\"European Educational Research Journal ; page 147490412199721 ; ISSN 1474-9041 1474-9041\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education\",\"subject\":\"Education\",\"authors\":\"Carlsson, Hanna\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1474904121997213\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"1295f506baa2a2db913d4161f24989cb67ba39ed471424c09a50298b4be3efde\",\"relevance\":43,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1474904121997213\"},{\"id\":\"a396640708c3dd7201ae9d51e6b19a1e06a7a448cb57a57cf48b762872655fc1\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ssoar.info\\/ssoar\\/handle\\/document\\/47231; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17645\\/mac.v3i4.335\",\"title\":\"Media Literacy in Montenegro\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Few countries in the world have introduced media education into their curriculums. Montenegro became one of them in 2009, when \\u201cmedia literacy\\u201d was introduced as an optional subject for 16 and 17 year old students of Gymnasium high schools. This article presents the findings of the first and only research conducted so far on media education in Montenegro. It is a national case study which examines the potential of media education to change the school culture and accelerate education system reform towards embracing the new digital education paradigm in the future. The focus is on the results of research conducted through in-depth interviews with media literacy teachers all over the country. Despite the many challenges, all teachers identify the potential of media education to strengthen some of the key competences of the students and to improve their motivation and academic performance.

In a digital work design, digital talents, digital fluency, digital networks, and digital platforms will be the most pronounced words. As a result of the rapid digital transformation effort all over the world, the huge increase in the demand for digital skills has led to a worldwide digital talent gap. To close this gap and to expand the digital talent ecosystem in a country, corporations, governments, and higher education institutions should act together. Universities have to understand the digital capability needs of employers to prepare digitally employable graduates for digitally dominated business environments. Governments should attract digital talents to simplify and digitize their services and operations. Corporations should attract digital talents to succeed in digital transformation and gain a competitive advantage. In this study, we emphasized the effect of digital transformation and digital talent shortage on governments, corporations, and universities. Then we highlighted the importance of their collaboration to develop and sustain digitally talented people in a country.

Research findings indicate that during the previous 23 years digital technology was portrayed as an overwhelmingly positive addition to higher education pedagogy. Less than half of articles analyzed contained attributes of contemplation. Non-contemplative technopedagogical approaches can lead to uncritical adoption or knee-jerk dismissal of digital technology \\u2013 either of which can have substantial and long-lasting consequences within teaching-learning environments. Contemporary pedagogies need to pay closer attention to digital technologies, but must do so in a purposeful and engaged manner.

However, although they make limited use of technology, they are very predisposed to integrate it in their work.

This paper investigates the knowledge about educational technologies of a group of undergraduate students studying the course Introduction to eLearning at a university in Australia and how they adopt unfamiliar technologies into their learning. The study explores the 'digital nativeness' of these students by investigating their degree of digital literacy and the ease with which they learn to make use of unfamiliar technologies. The findings show that the undergraduates were generally able to use unfamiliar technologies easily in their learning to create useful artefacts. They need, however to be made aware of what constitutes educational technologies and be provided with the opportunity to use them for meaningful purposes. The self-perception measures of the study indicated that digital natives can be taught digital literacy. \\u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We have witnessed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic how technology has been embraced within education from online classes to innovative mobile learning approaches and evaluating humanoid robots in education is the next step. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements, schools and society are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and robots in their daily activity. This paper presents a feasibility case study in digital health education where a humanoid robot was chosen to teach based on its form and function. With an imperative to establish a strong and sustainable learning space, the aim of this paper is to present results and learn about the future of digital health education from humanoid robots being deployed in digital health learning spaces. The paper concludes by highlighting key design challenges in unbundling educational approaches in the context of humanoid robots. It is intended that the outcomes of this paper will extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic by contributing to the humanoid robot technology discussion that will push towards more futuristic artificial intelligence in and for education ; peer-reviewed\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2022-03-14T14:53:08Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital education; digital; learning spaces; robots; health\",\"subject\":\"Digital education; digital; learning spaces; robots; health\",\"authors\":\"Connolly, Cornelia; Walsh, Jane C.; Worlikar, Hemendra; Ryan, Leona; Murray, Aoife; O\\u2019Connor, Sadhbh; Kelly, Jack; Coleman, Sean; Vyas Vadhirad, Vijay; Newell, Elaine; O\\u2018Keeffe, Derek T.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10379\\/17073\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"e8a876be6ccff58854b513a07acebec11bbb11cf5d1389abc4a080a4187dc806\",\"relevance\":2,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"ef04fdfbc28160f085b3745ffc1977357381dc2979b19d39f5199ed34b7bceaa\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/4303201; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3897\\/ap.2.e0381; oai:zenodo.org:4303201\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/4303201; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3897\\/ap.2.e0381\",\"title\":\"Spring 2020: Toward a Digital Transformation of Education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\\"We will remember this spring as a time of digital transformation in education,\\\" these words of Valery Falkov at the opening of 2020 International Moscow Salon of Education convey an atmosphere of change that has filled the entire educational sphere. Today's disputes on need for measuring teachers` professional deficits grow fast. Deficiency approach focused on revealing certain mismatch of teacher and his professional activity prevails in most studies that identify and assess the level of professional competences. Of course, this one of important tools for determining qualification gaps will be presented in research works, but in combination with activity-based approach which has proved its effectiveness. Action research is one that identifies and professional difficulties and need of teacher and logically determines routes of his professional development through the system of continuing professional education. It should be noticed that pandemic and transition to distant and online learning revealed lack of very simple skills in teachers such as proper organization of learning process in remote or online mode. Many teachers, students and their parents were not psychologically prepared for complete transition to digital education. In this regard, it is quite reasonable to highlight such challenge in education in digitalization process and need for overcoming it. The paper includes analysis of current satiation in school education in terms of digitalization and transition to online learning. The study brings together various views on methodology and mechanisms of digitalizing school education, and criteria of valid identification of teachers` digital competencies. The present study attempts to compile a passport of teacher's digital competencies and approve a pilot program called \\\"Cognitive models and algorithms for formation of teacher's digital competence in context of digital transformation of general education\\\".
