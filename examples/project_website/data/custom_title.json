An Experimental Solution to a Half-Century Debate\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Cognitive Dissonance can be conceived both as a concept related to the tendency to avoid internal contradictions in certain situations, and as a higher order theory about information processing in the human mind. In the last decades, this last sense has been strongly surpassed by the former, as nearly all experiment on the matter discuss cognitive dissonance as an output of motivational contradictions. In that sense, the question remains: is cognitive dissonance a process intrinsically associated with the way that the mind processes information, or is it caused by such specific contradictions? Objective: To evaluate the effects of cognitive dissonance in the absence of rewards or any mechanisms to manipulate motivation. Method: To solve this question, we introduce a new task, the hypothetical social arrays paradigm, which was applied to 50 undergraduate students. Results: Our findings support the perspective that the human mind shows a tendency to avoid internal dissonance even when there are no rewards or punishment involved. Moreover, our findings also suggest that this principle works outside the conscious level.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2009-06-23\",\"subject_orig\":\"Cognitive Dissonance; Cognitive Psychology; Information Processing\",\"subject\":\"Cognitive Dissonance; Cognitive Psychology; Information Processing\",\"authors\":\"\\u00c1lvaro Machado Dias; Eduardo Oda; Henrique Teruo Akiba; Leo Arruda; Luiz Felipe Bruder\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/1072511\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"010de37aa8252370b69d4fee3d5a97e091cdc8114eee03de4a236608e9682c85\",\"relevance\":75,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Zenodo\",\"repo\":\"ftzenodo\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"x\":\"-0.0351367763836683\",\"y\":\"0.00148617729941269\",\"labels\":\"010de37aa8252370b69d4fee3d5a97e091cdc8114eee03de4a236608e9682c85\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"04f150af8c7b627ce2d2fac36140a35dc532cead3555f777ca151a9253d242a7\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/esensi\\/article\\/view\\/13714; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2087-2038; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2461-1182; 2087-2038; 2461-1182; doi:10.15408\\/ess.v10i1.13714; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/90411afaaf554ae08b329217deb20795\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15408\\/ess.v10i1.13714; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/90411afaaf554ae08b329217deb20795\",\"title\":\"Nexus Between Islamic Spiritual Value, Cognitive Dissonance, Perceived Social Status, and Business Longevity\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This research aims to analyses the relationship pattern between Islamic spiritual value, cognitive dissonance, perceived social status, and business longevity.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to diversity and effective ways of addressing it in future classrooms as a result of changing demographics. Often, students experience resistance to diversity issues because their current understandings or beliefs may not coincide with the information presented in class. One psychological theory that can address this phenomenon is called cognitive dissonance. In the study reported here, the principles of cognitive dissonance theory are applied to an instructional strategy used to reduce resistance. The results indicate that incorporating cognitive dissonance theory into instruction on diversity creates an awareness of dissonance (i.e., metadissonance) and has the potential for reducing resistance to diversity issues. Implications for teacher education are addressed.\",\"published_in\":\"Educational and Psychological Studies Faculty Publications\",\"year\":\"2001-03-01T08:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Diversity in Higher Education; Education; Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education\",\"subject\":\"Diversity in Higher Education; Education; Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education\",\"authors\":\"McFalls, Elisabeth L.; Cobb-Roberts, Deirdre\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/digitalcommons.usf.edu\\/esf_facpub\\/6\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"09be25d06474f414d4570a4bdd7a086f7494c19fd7c9ecfec8f257dcf427bce9\",\"relevance\":56,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Digital Commons University of South Florida (USF)\",\"repo\":\"ftunisfloridatam\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Diversity in higher education, Extracurricular activities, General psychology\",\"x\":\"0.0834414501090795\",\"y\":\"0.221900149822338\",\"labels\":\"09be25d06474f414d4570a4bdd7a086f7494c19fd7c9ecfec8f257dcf427bce9\",\"area_uri\":10,\"area\":\"Diversity in higher education, Extracurricular activities, General psychology\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"0b8e7447e833c536f9b8f84ce14f01b94bdd8d710fa85a4dd2b1874d4c6e91fd\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/hgs\\/dcac011; https:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/hgs\\/article-pdf\\/36\\/1\\/46\\/43773979\\/dcac011.pdf\",\"title\":\"From Particularism to Mass Murder: Nazi Morality, Antisemitism, and Cognitive Dissonance\",\"paper_abstract\":\"ABSTRACT Scholars of the Third Reich have recently begun to study the ethical standards of National Socialist antisemites. Literature on Nazi morality frames German antisemitism as an attempt to reshape the country\\u2019s mores, but it pays insufficient attention to the psychological processes at work in replacing universalism with particularism. The author argues that cognitive dissonance theory could account for the uses and abuses of morality after 1933. He addresses three inter-related questions: did the regime utilize morality primarily to reduce cognitive dissonance?; did Germans invoke morality mainly to reduce cognitive dissonance?; and how successful was the appeal to morality in cognitive dissonance reduction? The first question makes us think about how morality can pre-empt feelings of cognitive dissonance prior to the implementation of certain policies or actions; the second explores how morality decreases dissonance afterward; and the third suggests that new moral frameworks replace older ones, eliminating cognitive dissonance altogether.\",\"published_in\":\"Holocaust and Genocide Studies ; volume 36, issue 1, page 46-59 ; ISSN 8756-6583 1476-7937\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"Political Science and International Relations; Sociology and Political Science; History\",\"subject\":\"Political Science and International Relations; Sociology and Political Science; History\",\"authors\":\"Kauders, Anthony D\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/hgs\\/dcac011\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"0b8e7447e833c536f9b8f84ce14f01b94bdd8d710fa85a4dd2b1874d4c6e91fd\",\"relevance\":117,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/hgs\\/dcac011\",\"content_provider\":\"Oxford University Press (via Crossref)\",\"repo\":\"croxfordunivpr\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"x\":\"-0.00426857020589824\",\"y\":\"0.0296048772557399\",\"labels\":\"0b8e7447e833c536f9b8f84ce14f01b94bdd8d710fa85a4dd2b1874d4c6e91fd\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"source\":\"Holocaust and Genocide Studies\",\"volume\":\"36\",\"issue\":\"1\",\"page\":\"46-59\",\"issn\":\"8756-6583 1476-7937\"},{\"id\":\"0e9803e98847754650d86ee5184df94cdf801bddc8fb7a9de7c20002fb6cf921\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2077-1444\\/9\\/11\\/332; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2077-1444; 2077-1444; doi:10.3390\\/rel9110332; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e8f1ffbdef4e40c5b20d879d73394164\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/rel9110332; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e8f1ffbdef4e40c5b20d879d73394164\",\"title\":\"Whence Orthodox Jewish Feminism?

This study uses Festinger\\u2019s (1965) cognitive dissonance theory and the 2017 Nishma Research Survey of American Modern Orthodox Jews to examine the effect of tension between feminism and Orthodox Judaism on lay men and women. For 14% of Modern Orthodox Jews, issues related to women or women\\u2019s roles are what cause them \\u201cthe most pain or unhappiness\\u201e as Orthodox Jews. The paper examines the sociodemographic characteristics associated with this response and tests whether those who experience this cognitive dissonance are more likely to (1) advocate for changes in the role of women within Orthodox Judaism and\\/or (2) experience religious doubt. The analysis reveals that these individuals overwhelmingly take a feminist stance on issues related to women\\u2019s roles in Orthodox Judaism, and they also manifest more religious doubt.

Much of the research on dissonance has focused on the intraindividual aspect of dissonance.

These perspectives seem to result in contradictory predictions about the role of social information on the arousal and reduction of cognitive dissonance, despite generally sharing a model of the social self based on, or consistent with, social identity theory (Tajfel, 1978).

The ethical and sustainable consumption literature has long recognised this misalignment of value, often referred to as an attitude-behaviour gap. While previous research has explored the reasons behind the attitude-behaviour gap and the rationales constructed by consumers to alleviate any associated tensions between mismatched values, this has not been framed within Festinger\\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Dissonance, particularly for fashion acquisition. This seems somewhat remiss, especially given that Festinger\\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Dissonance has been successfully applied in other consumption contexts and has offered commercial and social marketing opportunities for marketing activity development. The research utilises Festinger\\u2019s Theory of Cognitive Dissonance on qualitative data collected from 38 millennial participants living in Scotland. Adopting an interpretive approach, a semi-structured interview template was administered online and data were analysed thematically, revealing that an infusion of eco-fashion awareness was filtering into millennials\\u2019 consciousness. While the millennials reported feelings of cognitive dissonance when purchasing fast-fashion such as \\u2018irritation\\u2019 and \\u2018guilt\\u2019, unlike previous research, here they did not attempt to justify their behaviour in order to resolve their feelings of dissonance. Rather, the participants perceived this as an opportunity to reaffirm their preferences for sustainability for future consumption practice.

Cognitive dissonance theory states that after making a difficult choice between two equally preferred items, the act of rejecting a favorite item induces an uncomfortable feeling (cognitive dissonance), which in turn motivates individuals to change their preferences to match their prior decision (i.e., reducing preference for rejected items). Recently, however, Chen and Risen [Chen K, Risen J (2010) J Pers Soc Psychol 99:573-594] pointed out a serious methodological problem, which casts a doubt on the very existence of this choice-induced preference change as studied over the past 50 y. Here, using a proper control condition and two measures of preferences (self-report and brain activity), we found that the mere act of making a choice can change self-report preference as well as its neural representation (i.e., striatum activity), thus providing strong evidence for choice-induced preference change. Furthermore, our data indicate that the anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tracked the degree of cognitive dissonance on a trial-by-trial basis. Our findings provide important insights into the neural basis of how actions can alter an individual's preferences.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2010-12-21\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"preference change; cognitive dissonance; neural correlates\",\"authors\":\"Izuma, Keise; Matsumoto, Madoka; Murayama, Kou; Samejima, Kazuyuki; Sadato, Norihiro; Matsumoto, Kenji\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.soton.ac.uk\\/425212\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1e956545c7171eaeac869199f98cbd27192712eb09550053016476cbd13dabcf\",\"relevance\":76,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"University of Southampton: e-Prints Soton\",\"repo\":\"ftsouthampton\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Neural correlates, Blind choice, Choice-induced prefereences\",\"x\":\"0.308721529001675\",\"y\":\"-0.0101029375918346\",\"labels\":\"1e956545c7171eaeac869199f98cbd27192712eb09550053016476cbd13dabcf\",\"area_uri\":12,\"area\":\"Neural correlates, Blind choice, Choice-induced prefereences\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"21af9331a4da4bfb9543797bff5473cac40f534677121919a699f007d5b24eca\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1077801218824999; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/1077801218824999; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/1077801218824999\",\"title\":\"Reducing Rape-Related Attitudes Utilizing a Cognitive Dissonance Paradigm\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study used a cognitive dissonance mechanism that required college students to write essays dispelling previously endorsed rape myth beliefs.

Then, the factors were named according to the items they contain as follows: The family dimension, the emotional dimension, self-compatibility dimension, control and dominance dimension, social dimension, educational dimension and discipline and behavioral commitment dimension. Factorial validity and internal consistency estimates wer acceptable. The results of the study generally show the possibility of extracting cognitive dissonance. They also show that the current scale of cognitive dissonance is valid and meets the required standard specifications. Therefore it can be used in other studies.

This article argues for the utility and value of the \\u201cbelieving selves\\u201d framework, in conjunction with revisionist theories of cognitive dissonance, to advance the claim that beliefs are representations, as well as functions, of cultural history which bind individual and society. ; http:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/journal\\/religions ; hb2016 ; Anthropology and Archaeology\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-07\",\"subject_orig\":\"Study of religion; Belief; Believing selves; Cognitive dissonance; Individual; Society\",\"subject\":\"Study of religion; Belief; Believing selves; Cognitive dissonance; Individual; Society\",\"authors\":\"Bae, Bosco B.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2263\\/56694\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"2f57a703366a6445fa33c81dc27034cf60eddc97671a257e52e989b70a239183\",\"relevance\":44,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"University of Pretoria: UPSpace\",\"repo\":\"ftunivpretoria\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Lexical-semantic features, Literary translation, Religious studies\",\"x\":\"0.038467670803971\",\"y\":\"0.29618226401845\",\"labels\":\"2f57a703366a6445fa33c81dc27034cf60eddc97671a257e52e989b70a239183\",\"area_uri\":6,\"area\":\"Lexical-semantic features, Literary translation, Religious studies\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"31e9aa9103313da2ecc08b99f3b5d3e94ceff5cc993d817e389d59b89c26b195\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/curis.ku.dk\\/portal\\/da\\/publications\\/cognitive-dissonance-from-2-years-of-age(b69524fc-9082-4aa2-a564-ffe2f7b67c87).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.cognition.2022.105039; https:\\/\\/curis.ku.dk\\/ws\\/files\\/291606619\\/GrosseWiesmannEtAl_CogDissFrom2Years.pdf\",\"title\":\"Cognitive dissonance from 2 years of age:Toddlers', but not infants', blind choices induce preferences\",\"paper_abstract\":\"As adults, not only do we choose what we prefer, we also tend to adapt our preferences according to our previous choices.

In the present preregistered study, we asked when this phenomenon develops. We reasoned that cognitive dissonance may emerge around 2 years of age in connection with the development of children's self-concept. We presented N = 200 children aged 16 to 36 months with a blind choice between two toys, and then tested whether their choice had induced a preference for the chosen, and a devaluation of the discarded, toy. Indeed, children's choice-induced preferences substantially increased with age. 26- to 36-months-old children preferred a neutral over the previously blindly discarded toy, but the previously chosen over the neutral toy, in line with cognitive dissonance predictions. Younger infants showed evidence against such blind choice-induced preferences, indicating its emergence around 2 years of age. Contrary to our hypotheses, the emergence of blind choice-induced preferences was not related to measures of self-concept development in the second year of life. Our results suggest that cognitive dissonance develops around 2 years. We speculate about cognitive mechanisms that underlie this development, including later-developing aspects of the self-concept and increasingly abstract representational abilities. ; As adults, not only do we choose what we prefer, we also tend to adapt our preferences according to our previous choices.

When our practice is in conflict with our previous attitudes often change our attitude so that we will operate in concert with; this is cognitive dissonance. The aim of this study was evaluation of relation between decision making styles, personality traits and physiological components of cognitive dissonance and also offering a statistical model about them. Materials and Methods : In this correlation study, 130 students of Elmi-Karbordi University of Safadasht were invited and they were asked to complete Scott & Bruce Decision-Making Styles Questionnaire and Gray-Wilson Personality Questionnaire. Before and after distributing those questionnaires, their physiological conditions were receded. Cognitive dissonance was induced by writing about reducing amount of budget which deserved to orphans and rating the reduction of interest of lovely character that ignore his or her fans. Data analysis conducted through regression and multi vitiate covariance. Results : There were correlation between cognitive styles (Avoidant, dependent, logical and intuitive) and also personality variables (Flight and Approach, active avoidance, Fight and Extinction) with cognitive dissonance. The effect of cognitive (decision making styles) and personality variables on physiological components was mediate indirectly through cognitive dissonance, in levels of P=0.01 and P=0.05 difference, was significant. Conclusion : Decision making styles and personality traits are related to cognitive dissonance and its physiological components, and also predict physiological components of cognitive dissonance.\",\"published_in\":\"Sal\\u0101mat-i ijtim\\u0101\\u0312\\u012b, Vol 3, Iss 3, Pp 211-218 (2016)\",\"year\":\"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Decision making styles; personality traits; Cognitive dissonance; Physiological components; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"Decision making styles; personality traits; Cognitive dissonance; Physiological components; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Saeed Imani; Maryam Zare; Alireza Aghayoosefi; Hossein Zare; Farhad Shaghaghi\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/d43a284beb3345f8bb9333ca475ba34e\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"35ccbef46b0c08afdb01ed0b3b27b55ba102d06dac4d75ce326bc665fc2aba2a\",\"relevance\":101,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Directory of Open Access Journals: DOAJ Articles\",\"repo\":\"ftdoajarticles\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"x\":\"-0.0559126295408945\",\"y\":\"0.0367517125632683\",\"labels\":\"35ccbef46b0c08afdb01ed0b3b27b55ba102d06dac4d75ce326bc665fc2aba2a\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"source\":\"Sal\\u0101mat-i ijtim\\u0101\\u0312\\u012b\",\"volume\":\"3\",\"issue\":\"3\",\"page\":\"211-218\",\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"3abbadedc0c156b945b158a24a93c18af728af1961e620755ae80c1e538f0066\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.psychologicabelgica.com\\/articles\\/517; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2054-670X; 2054-670X; doi:10.5334\\/pb.517; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/627e622cf12343e28aee18c711533892\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5334\\/pb.517; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/627e622cf12343e28aee18c711533892\",\"title\":\"On the Characteristics of the Cognitive Dissonance State: Exploration Within the Pleasure Arousal Dominance Model\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Little is actually known about the nature and characteristics of the cognitive dissonance state.

However, the link between refugees\\u2019 social cognition and entrepreneurship commitment tends to be overlooked.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach This paper reviews the extant knowledge of refugee entrepreneurship and refugee business support. It synthesizes the literature on cognitive dissonance, multiple embeddedness and hospitality to inform a conceptual model and explain the ramifications of refugees\\u2019 entrepreneurial cognition on refugee business support and how public attitudes in the destination transform accordingly. Findings This paper illustrates the prevalent imbalance between the provision of support and refugees\\u2019 anticipations in developed economies. A conceptual toolkit is framed to disclose the succeeding influence of cognitive dissonance on the performances of refugee business support. This framework indicates that the cognitive dissonance could elicit heterogeneous aftermath of refugee business support service, resulting in a deteriorated\\/ameliorated hospitality context. Originality\\/value This conceptual toolkit unfolds cognitive ingredients in the refugee entrepreneurship journey, providing a framework for understanding refugee business support and the formation of hospitality under cognitive dissonance.

According to this psychological theory - developed in the 1950s and widely used ever since - a dissonance between attitudes and behaviour can result in feelings of discomfort, which people will try to reduce by changing either their attitudes or their behaviour. In our interpretation, we focus on two interrelated decision processes linked with travel behaviour, i.e., travel mode choice and residential location choice. Although a considerable number of travel behaviour studies refer to the cognitive dissonance theory in order to explain found results (e.g., changed attitudes), a full examination of the process of cognitive dissonance (reduction) in the travel behaviour literature is currently lacking. Through this critical consolidation of transport literature on the cognitive dissonance topic, we propose future research directions to fill this gap. We argue that the cognitive dissonance theory can provide valuable insights into satisfaction levels with travel and the place of residence, while also helping to explain changes in travel-related attitudes and choices of where to live and which travel mode to use.\",\"published_in\":\"TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE ; ISSN: 0965-8564\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Earth and Environmental Sciences; Business and Economics; Management Science and Operations Research; Transportation; Civil and Structural Engineering; Travel behaviour; Cognitive dissonance; Travel mode choice; Residential location choice; Travel satisfaction; Residential self-selection; TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; NEIGHBORHOOD TYPE; MODE CHOICE; ATTITUDES EVIDENCE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PUBLIC TRANSPORT; SCHOOL TRAVEL; LAND-USE\",\"subject\":\"Earth and Environmental Sciences; Business and Economics; Management Science and Operations Research; Transportation; Civil and Structural Engineering; Travel behaviour; Cognitive dissonance; Travel mode choice; Residential location choice; Travel satisfaction; Residential self-selection; TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; NEIGHBORHOOD TYPE; MODE CHOICE; ATTITUDES EVIDENCE; PUBLIC TRANSPORT; SCHOOL TRAVEL; \",\"authors\":\"De Vos, Jonas; Singleton, Patrick A.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8738799\",\"oa_state\":\"0\",\"url\":\"406e1441608078dd807841a175dbe8fc7dd91c65c40bff8ec728d2498a26ade9\",\"relevance\":43,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Ghent University Academic Bibliography\",\"repo\":\"ftunivgent\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Absent bystanders, Disaster management, Emergency supply chain\",\"x\":\"0.0631796080161565\",\"y\":\"-0.116363949096344\",\"labels\":\"406e1441608078dd807841a175dbe8fc7dd91c65c40bff8ec728d2498a26ade9\",\"area_uri\":14,\"area\":\"Absent bystanders, Disaster management, Emergency supply chain\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"451485cd9155575e06af5a7f6c93f704fc55c2f2048df83e57f217dc8ef5d7f9\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/publication.petra.ac.id\\/index.php\\/manajemen-pemasaran\\/article\\/view\\/7436\\/6745; https:\\/\\/publication.petra.ac.id\\/index.php\\/manajemen-pemasaran\\/article\\/view\\/7436\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/publication.petra.ac.id\\/index.php\\/manajemen-pemasaran\\/article\\/view\\/7436\",\"title\":\"PENGARUH AFTER SALE SERVICE TERHADAP COGNITIVE DISSONANCE DENGAN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SEBAGAI VARIABEL INTERVENING PADA DEALER MOBIL HONDA DI SURABAYA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstrak - Mobil merupakan alat transpotasi yang dibutuhkan oleh khalayak publik sebagai media transpotasi.

The descriptive approach which is developped here aims to report on the use of this lexeme in the context of controversial exchanges. The specificity of the expression \\\"cognitive dissonance\\\", contrary to other psychiatric attacks, lies in the fact that it is also a meta-argumentative criticism. Indeed, \\\"cognitive dissonance\\\" initially designates in cognitive sciences an incoherence between two elements perceived by the brain. The analyses carried out in this article, paying particular attention to counter-speech, show that this initial definition is reinvested during the argumentative use of \\\"cognitive dissonance\\\", which produces a double movement of refutation-disqualification.

In Experiment 1, this resulted in higher levels of self-reported guilt and shame compared to the control condition. Experiment 2 further showed that a religious self-affirmation task eliminated the guilt and shame. In Experiment 3, participants boosted their religious attitudes as a result of dissonance, and both religious and non-religious self-affirmation tasks eliminated this effect.

However, they also revealed strong instances of cognitive dissonance that we contend was fostered by the contradictions some students detected between the rhetoric and the reality of capitalism; and by the perpetuation of socially bereft capitalist values in accounting curricula. The assignment manifested student discontent with the current pervading economic system and its moral and ethical precepts. We identify the ways by which students responded to their cognitive dissonance. We propose some pedagogic and curriculum initiatives to improve accounting education. These initiatives call for stronger efforts to connect accounting topics with the social world in order to demystify the alleged naturalness of the capitalist system; for students to be encouraged to imagine other cultures and discourses; and for students to challenge any prevailing ideology.\",\"published_in\":\"Chabrak , N & Craig , R 2013 , ' Student imaginings, cognitive dissonance and critical thinking ' Critical Perspectives On Accounting , vol 24 , no. 2 , pp. 91-104 .

Several psychological accounts have not yet proved helpful in explaining the cause and mechanism responsible for the existence of these unrealistically positive perspectives (Fowers & Pomerantz, 1992). However, cognitive dissonance had never been examined in this manner.The goal of the current study was to therefore examine the plausibility of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) as an explanation of positive marital illusions. Various cognitive dissonance paradigms suggest that one will positively evaluate a choice after it is made, especially if that choice is difficult to change (Harmon-Jones & Mills, 199). A marriage in which one experiences \\\"constraint from divorce,\\\" such that divorce is a less attractive or more difficult option to obtain, illustrates just such a situation. A cognitive dissonance line of reasoning suggests that the experience of being trapped in a marriage may result in one developing highly positive views of that marriage.In addressing the research questions, the current study examined the relationships between one potential component of a cognitive dissonance conceptualization (constraint from divorce) and two types of marital outlook variables (positive marital illusions as represented by predictions of divorce, and marital satisfaction). Ten types of \\\"constraint from divorce\\\" were represented. Principal axis factor analysis and internal consistency analysis were utilized for data reduction to identify scales that were used as independent and dependent variables.The current study utilized a large, prospective, nationally representative sample of women who were married at the time of the initial assessment. Pearson product-moment correlation and multiple regression analyses were utilized for hypothesis testing purposes. Results were examined in terms of statistical significance as well as practical significance (effect size). Results indicate that divorce constraints were, at best, weakly related to divorce likelihood predictions and marital satisfaction. These results therefore do not provide support for cognitive dissonance as a plausible explanation of positive marital illusions. Alternate avenues of future examination are discussed.\",\"published_in\":\"Dissertations from ProQuest\",\"year\":\"2002-01-01T08:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Psychology; Social; Psychology; Clinical\",\"subject\":\"Psychology; Social; Psychology; Clinical\",\"authors\":\"Scheer, Marc Robert\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholarlyrepository.miami.edu\\/dissertations\\/1910\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"59a8eab0a41aae714d5c616b9af1b1f77572e9af5d21d480bcaff8c68ac5da6b\",\"relevance\":38,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"University of Miami: Scholarly Repository\",\"repo\":\"ftunivmiamiir\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"x\":\"-0.09156023019925\",\"y\":\"0.203606165790818\",\"labels\":\"59a8eab0a41aae714d5c616b9af1b1f77572e9af5d21d480bcaff8c68ac5da6b\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"59bb41af758a1cdd883b85407b2c541434530ff22c3d609276f43b89990d697a\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.untag-sby.ac.id\\/index.php\\/ISMP\\/article\\/view\\/5371\\/3822; http:\\/\\/jurnal.untag-sby.ac.id\\/index.php\\/ISMP\\/article\\/view\\/5371\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.untag-sby.ac.id\\/index.php\\/ISMP\\/article\\/view\\/5371\",\"title\":\"Cognitive Dissonance and Resilience in Facing Covid-19 Pandemic\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Covid-19 pandemic that lasted for the past 1 year in Indonesia has become a phenomenon which caused many changes in social behavior. One of the social behavior changes is due to the cognitive dissonance experienced by the community as a form of psychological discomfort due to the government's inconsistency in handling the conditions of the outbreak. Resilience is a psychological resource that can help individuals reduce psychological discomfort and adapt for changes in facing the Covid-19 pandemic. This study aims to analyze whether there is a relationship between cognitive dissonance and community resilience related to the Covid-19 pandemic. This study uses a quantitative approach. Data were collected using a questionnaire, as a modification from the Wagnild & Young Resilience scale (1993), as well as the Cognitive Dissonance scale which was compiled by the author based on the aspects explained by Festinger (Sarwono 2006). The research subjects were 52 people who were obtained by sending a questionnaire via google form. Data analysis using product moment correlation. From the data analysis, the value of r = 0.302 with a p value of 0.030 (p <0.05). The results of this study indicate that there is a relationship between cognitive dissonance and resilience. The results of this study also prove that the discomfort thinking due to cognitive dissonance is associated with high resilience.Keywords: Cognitive dissonance, resilience, covid-19 pandemic\",\"published_in\":\"International Seminar of Multicultural Psychology; International Seminar of Multicultural Psychology (ISMP 1st)\",\"year\":\"2020-12-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"cognitive dissonance; covid pandemic; dissonance resilience\",\"authors\":\"Januardini, Lasya Eka; Suryanto, Suryanto; Santi, Dyan Evita\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.untag-sby.ac.id\\/index.php\\/ISMP\\/article\\/view\\/5371\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"59bb41af758a1cdd883b85407b2c541434530ff22c3d609276f43b89990d697a\",\"relevance\":39,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Jurnal Universitas 17 Agustus 1945 Surabaya\",\"repo\":\"ftunitagsurabaya\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"x\":\"0.000156882759296534\",\"y\":\"0.0598597016734505\",\"labels\":\"59bb41af758a1cdd883b85407b2c541434530ff22c3d609276f43b89990d697a\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"5d74d126fc1c6110ef5910330c49a5e91e3be20df4ef3811d9b14cb59821e89b\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/765008; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/esam\\/issue\\/47160\\/541801; doi:10.18354\\/esam.541801\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/esam\\/issue\\/47160\\/541801; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.18354\\/esam.541801\",\"title\":\"A PILOT STUDY OF CONSUMERS\\u2019 COGNITIVE DISSONANCE AND ITS ANTECEDENTS ; T\\u00dcKET\\u0130MDE B\\u0130L\\u0130\\u015eSEL UYUMSUZLUK VE \\u00d6NC\\u00dcLLER\\u0130 \\u00dcZER\\u0130NE P\\u0130LOT ARA\\u015eTIRMA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Cognitive dissonance is defined as asituation that involves conflicts among cognitions, emotions and behaviors ofindividuals that have a quest for consistency and order in their life.Dissonance can be experienced between many dimensions, i.e. cognitions,emotions, and behaviors.

As discussed, the application of this theory is gaining some popularity with economists.\",\"published_in\":\"Psychological Reports ; volume 73, issue 3_suppl, page 1179-1183 ; ISSN 0033-2941 1558-691X\",\"year\":\"1993\",\"subject_orig\":\"General Psychology\",\"subject\":\"General Psychology\",\"authors\":\"Davis, William L.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2466\\/pr0.1993.73.3f.1179\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"61eb4804535646dc833ed5528edf2154f889b3843f71abbe8b3ac4eac60b5389\",\"relevance\":78,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2466\\/pr0.1993.73.3f.1179\",\"content_provider\":\"SAGE Publications (via Crossref)\",\"repo\":\"crsagepubl\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Lexical-semantic features, Literary translation, Religious studies\",\"x\":\"0.151545348670328\",\"y\":\"0.0254232914447834\",\"labels\":\"61eb4804535646dc833ed5528edf2154f889b3843f71abbe8b3ac4eac60b5389\",\"area_uri\":6,\"area\":\"Lexical-semantic features, Literary translation, Religious studies\",\"source\":\"Psychological Reports\",\"volume\":\"73\",\"issue\":\"3_suppl\",\"page\":\"1179-1183\",\"issn\":\"0033-2941 1558-691X\"},{\"id\":\"631027e76ba1c7a0450f1675b0ee5fbf613bf2bc5f72a09b1e04d879084e0451\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/shenakht.muk.ac.ir\\/article-1-922-en.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2588-6657; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2476-2962; 2588-6657; 2476-2962; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a2fe97e2f03d4d83ba68dd08a881a27c\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a2fe97e2f03d4d83ba68dd08a881a27c\",\"title\":\"The comparison of cognitive dissonance and social exchange styles in depressive disorder patients with healthy individuals\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Introduction: Using an inefficient styles of social exchange and cognitive dissonance could lead to negative emotions. Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the cognitive dissonance and social exchange styles, amongst two groups of women patients with major depressive disorder and normal individuals. Method: In this causal-comparative study, first, 60 women patients with Major Depressive disorder from 3 psychotherapy centers in Tehran were selected by available sampling method. Then, 60 women who attended in different areas of the city, were selected randomly, so that 120 women, were assessed. Questionnaires of cognitive dissonance and social exchange styles were applied in order to collect data. Data analysis was performed by Kolmogorov- Smirnov, (KS-test) and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test , using SPSS-PC (v.20). Results: The results indicated that individuals with depression are more likely to be in cognitive arousal state (P<0.05). While normal individuals were more able to reduce their cognitive dissonance. Equally, in social exchange styles there was a meaningful difference in Mean (average) of individualism and tracking in the two groups. But there was not a meaningful difference between Mean (average) of the fairness, benefit-seeking, individualism, tracking and overinvestment variables. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, in treatment of depressed women, pay attention to arousal and Cognitive dissonance-reducing is needed.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u0634\\u0646\\u0627\\u0633\\u06cc \\u0648 \\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u067e\\u0632\\u0634\\u06a9\\u06cc \\u0634\\u0646\\u0627\\u062e\\u062a, Vol 7, Iss 3, Pp 124-135 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"cognitive dissonance; social exchange; depression; exchange styles; Psychiatry; RC435-571; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"cognitive dissonance; social exchange; depression; exchange styles; Psychiatry; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Shaghayegh Shojafard\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a2fe97e2f03d4d83ba68dd08a881a27c\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"631027e76ba1c7a0450f1675b0ee5fbf613bf2bc5f72a09b1e04d879084e0451\",\"relevance\":37,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Directory of Open Access Journals: DOAJ Articles\",\"repo\":\"ftdoajarticles\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Sciences sociales & comportementales, Smoking, Social & behavioral sciences\",\"x\":\"-0.154718092334193\",\"y\":\"0.125432016094656\",\"labels\":\"631027e76ba1c7a0450f1675b0ee5fbf613bf2bc5f72a09b1e04d879084e0451\",\"area_uri\":7,\"area\":\"Sciences sociales & comportementales, Smoking, Social & behavioral sciences\",\"source\":\"\\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u0634\\u0646\\u0627\\u0633\\u06cc \\u0648 \\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u067e\\u0632\\u0634\\u06a9\\u06cc \\u0634\\u0646\\u0627\\u062e\\u062a\",\"volume\":\"7\",\"issue\":\"3\",\"page\":\"124-135\",\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"660d06579f15d1da03d9f02601bf378e4d840ce4c05032de1443b28400a857b2\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2466\\/pr0.1968.22.2.655; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.2466\\/pr0.1968.22.2.655\",\"title\":\"A Measure of Cognitive Dissonance as a Predictor of Smoking Treatment Outcome\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In an effort to determine which pre-treatment variables could serve as predictors of success in a smoking-treatment program, 213 adult volunteer smokers were assessed for a wide range of factors.

They doubt whether the bystander phenomenon applies to Mid Staffs nurses; they believe that cognitive dissonance is a better explanation of why nurses fail to behave compassionately; and they think that I am 'perhaps a bit rash' to conclude that 'teaching compassion may be fruitless'. In this comment, I discuss all three points. I suggest that the bystander phenomenon is irrelevant; that Timmins & de Vries give an incomplete account of cognitive dissonance; and that it isn't rash to propose that educating nurses 'for compassion' is a red herring. Additionally, I comment on the idea that I wish to mount a 'defence of healthcare staff'. \\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2015-04-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"cognitive dissonance; a comment; absent bystanders\",\"authors\":\"Paley, John\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.nedt.2014.12.006\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"79dece7b95c8a2f9dfd7e25805950fb8c5d9923dbe62c15228d2daf8a87bb9cd\",\"relevance\":55,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.nedt.2014.12.006\",\"content_provider\":\"SHURA (Sheffield Hallam University Research Archive)\",\"repo\":\"ftsheffhu\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Absent bystanders, Disaster management, Emergency supply chain\",\"x\":\"0.0349685341793098\",\"y\":\"0.359035684761024\",\"labels\":\"79dece7b95c8a2f9dfd7e25805950fb8c5d9923dbe62c15228d2daf8a87bb9cd\",\"area_uri\":14,\"area\":\"Absent bystanders, Disaster management, Emergency supply chain\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"7e038212f4310ed34ed35fd15966cc48e89e7ed8e922bbad77c8a5211b35de4e\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/17473611011093925; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/17473611011093925\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/17473611011093925\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"Impulse buying and cognitive dissonance: a study conducted among the spring break student shoppers\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine certain aspects of the relationship between impulse buying and resulting cognitive dissonance in the context of spring break student shopping. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The paper employs exploratory analysis utilizing a quantitative approach. The sample population was drawn from college students who went on shopping trips during their spring break. The survey instrument measures the cognitive dissonance construct and the impulsive trait, among other things. Because spring break shopping by students differs from typical adult shopping, some context specific nuances are also explored. Findings The first hypothesis tested was that the level of cognitive dissonance resulting from impulsive buying would be significantly greater than that which occurred after a planned purchase. Additionally, informed by prior theory, it was expected that more impulsive individuals would experience a higher level of cognitive dissonance after an unplanned purchase than less impulsive individuals. However, the empirical data were found to directly contradict these hypotheses. Impulsive buyers seem to experience rather lower levels of cognitive dissonance than planned buyers. Likewise, when a typically non\\u2010impulsive buyer makes an impulsive purchase, the cognitive dissonance experienced by him is seen to be significantly higher than when a typically impulsive buyer makes such a purchase. These findings lead to a new theory, according to which, impulse buying behavior may be a coping strategy used to avoid discomfort associated with the possible disconfirmation of expectations. Originality\\/value Understanding present generation college students' consumption\\u2010related behavior may give vital clues about the changing nature of consumption, as well as offering predictors for the consumption behavior of the adult population in the near future. In addition, by testing certain so far unexplored aspects of the relationship between impulse buying and cognitive dissonance, the paper enriches consumer research literature.\",\"published_in\":\"Young Consumers ; volume 11, issue 4, page 291-306 ; ISSN 1747-3616\",\"year\":\"2010\",\"subject_orig\":\"Life-span and Life-course Studies; Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)\",\"subject\":\"Life-span and Life-course Studies; Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)\",\"authors\":\"George, Babu P.; Yaoyuneyong, Gallayanee\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/17473611011093925\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"7e038212f4310ed34ed35fd15966cc48e89e7ed8e922bbad77c8a5211b35de4e\",\"relevance\":64,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/17473611011093925\",\"content_provider\":\"Emerald (via Crossref)\",\"repo\":\"cremerald\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Compulsive buying, Customer expectations, Exploratory study\",\"x\":\"0.0699964779704527\",\"y\":\"-0.0120495848716756\",\"labels\":\"7e038212f4310ed34ed35fd15966cc48e89e7ed8e922bbad77c8a5211b35de4e\",\"area_uri\":13,\"area\":\"Compulsive buying, Customer expectations, Exploratory study\",\"source\":\"Young Consumers\",\"volume\":\"11\",\"issue\":\"4\",\"page\":\"291-306\",\"issn\":\"1747-3616\"},{\"id\":\"7fb70e6f01866acd40dadeee7b1ed26068c85c376dc5ba335b580a07c9ba4ae9\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/revistadeturism.ro\\/rdt\\/article\\/view\\/377; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1844-2994; 1844-2994; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/27195096eccd479b97a7d576fb13726e\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/27195096eccd479b97a7d576fb13726e\",\"title\":\"THE SOURCES OF THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE IN THE RELIGIOUS TOURISM\",\"paper_abstract\":\"One of the concepts that were studied on a large scale since 1957 is Festinger\\u2019s cognitive dissonance. This concept consists on a discomfort or pain experienced by the individual when there is a contradiction between some of his beliefs, his values or his behavior. The generated discomfort might push the pilgrims to avoid the discomforting situation, by avoiding the being in the same situation. This concept has been widely studied in the marketing field as it causes the customers to change their perception about the product or even to quit it. In the field of religious tourism the question of cognitive dissonance seems to be of interest. In fact, combining both a spiritual dimension and a touristic one the religious tourism comes with different expectations and criteria\\u2019s of judgment and face contradictious experiences and values resulting in the generation of the discomfort of the cognitive dissonance. Therefore, this research interviews twenty pilgrims in order to discover the main sources of cognitive dissonances.

J Gager in Kingdom and community (1975) used cognitive dissonance theory to account for Christian responses to disconfirmation of their eschatological expectations. In a later article (1981) he used the theory to illuminate Paul's conversion. It was with the same intention that Segal (1990) applied this among other theories. R\\u00e4is\\u00e4nen implicitly draws upon, if not the theory, then the thinking and observations which lie behind it in his study of Paul and the Jewish Law (1986). In my own previous work (1992; 1993; 1996) I have sought to apply cognitive dissonance both to Paul's conversion and to its much later repercussions for his views on matters of Jewish heritage and observance. Opposition to the use of cognitive dissonance theory in New Testament Studies has been led by Malina (1986). Drawing upon the cautions raised by Snow and Machalek (1982), Malina argues that cognitive dissonance theory is inappropriate to the early Christian situation, as the culture accommodated anomalous beliefs and practices without any consciousness of their incompatibility. Malina therefore suggests that, rather than Festinger's notion of cognitive dissonance (1957), Merton's conception of normative ambivalence (1976) should be used to account for discrepancies in the records of early Christianity. A corollary of this would be that dissonant information would not generate any pressure towards resolution in the early Christian context. This article will examine Malina's criticisms of the use of cognitive dissonance theory in Biblical Studies. Particular attention will be given to the question whether cognitive dissonance and normative ambivalence can in reality be deemed to be mutually exclusive alternatives. It will be argued that situations do occur where anomalies do not generate cognitive dissonance, and these are more adequately accounted for in terms of normative ambivalence. However, there remain situations where the stress occasioned by discrepant beliefs, practices, and experiences is evident. These situations are more adequately accounted for by cognitive dissonance. The theory therefore remains a valid tool for New Testament studies.\",\"published_in\":\"Religion and Theology ; volume 5, issue 2, page 138-153 ; ISSN 1023-0807 1574-3012\",\"year\":\"1998\",\"subject_orig\":\"Religious studies; Social Sciences (miscellaneous)\",\"subject\":\"Religious studies; Social Sciences (miscellaneous)\",\"authors\":\"Taylor, Nicholas H.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/157430198x00020\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"890f152faf136ff5d077ee3519ebaac00d2389c07fb43050b28947746fee8c67\",\"relevance\":111,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/157430198x00020\",\"content_provider\":\"Brill (via Crossref)\",\"repo\":\"crbrillap\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Lexical-semantic features, Literary translation, Religious studies\",\"x\":\"-0.00454394291841214\",\"y\":\"0.0107854706516386\",\"labels\":\"890f152faf136ff5d077ee3519ebaac00d2389c07fb43050b28947746fee8c67\",\"area_uri\":6,\"area\":\"Lexical-semantic features, Literary translation, Religious studies\",\"source\":\"Religion and Theology\",\"volume\":\"5\",\"issue\":\"2\",\"page\":\"138-153\",\"issn\":\"1023-0807 1574-3012\"},{\"id\":\"8a90afe973c16e5231eaf7260a03343eb16bc199358c59d6cc9bfd4524733682\",\"relation\":\"hal-00983729; https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-00983729\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-00983729\",\"title\":\"Cognitive dissonance in children: justification of effort or contrast?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"PMID: 18567273 ; International audience ; Justification of effort is a form of cognitive dissonance in which the subjective value of an outcome is directly related to the effort that went into obtaining it. However, it is likely that in social contexts (such as the requirements for joining a group) an inference can be made (perhaps incorrectly) that an outcome that requires greater effort to obtain in fact has greater value. Here we present evidence that a cognitive dissonance effect can be found in children under conditions that offer better control for the social value of the outcome. This effect is quite similar to contrast effects that recently have been studied in animals. We suggest that contrast between the effort required to obtain the outcome and the outcome itself provides a more parsimonious account of this phenomenon and perhaps other related cognitive dissonance phenomena as well. Research will be needed to identify cognitive dissonance processes that are different from contrast effects of this kind.\",\"published_in\":\"ISSN: 1069-9384 ; Psychonomic Bulletin and Review ; https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-00983729 ; Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, Psychonomic Society, 2008, 15 (3), pp.673--677\",\"year\":\"2008\",\"subject_orig\":\"ACL; [SHS.PSY]Humanities and Social Sciences\\/Psychology\",\"subject\":\"ACL; \",\"authors\":\"Alessandri, J\\u00e9r\\u00f4me; Darcheville, Jean-Claude; Zentall, Thomas R\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-00983729\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8a90afe973c16e5231eaf7260a03343eb16bc199358c59d6cc9bfd4524733682\",\"relevance\":30,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Archive ouverte HAL (Hyper Article en Ligne, CCSD - Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe)\",\"repo\":\"ftccsdartic\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Order effects, ACL, Affect\",\"x\":\"-0.233592093133665\",\"y\":\"0.0256126109734235\",\"labels\":\"8a90afe973c16e5231eaf7260a03343eb16bc199358c59d6cc9bfd4524733682\",\"area_uri\":11,\"area\":\"Order effects, ACL, Affect\",\"source\":\"Psychonomic Bulletin and Review \",\"volume\":\"15\",\"issue\":\"3\",\"page\":\"673--677\",\"issn\":\"1069-9384\"},{\"id\":\"8dd779df53195b919663877d13fe73af621f688b82a4a007db6b34341faf4997\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2073-4336\\/2\\/1\\/114\\/; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2073-4336; doi:10.3390\\/g2010114; 2073-4336; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2e20eab008e24bfd816753dbd3ee02b8\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/g2010114; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2e20eab008e24bfd816753dbd3ee02b8\",\"title\":\"Do I Really Want to Know?

Methods: This study used an experimental questionnaire survey on managers of firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and Over-The-Counter. Results: The empirical results show that cognitive dissonance does not mediate the relationship between sunk costs and willingness to continue an unfavorable investment project. However, cognitive dissonance has a moderating effect, and only when the level of cognitive dissonance is high does the sunk cost have significantly positive impacts on willingness to continue on with an unfavorable investment.

Using the behavioral variable of actual gambling and an attitudinal variable of negative beliefs about gambling, a third, practical measure of cognitive dissonance was developed. By using questionnaires completed by 200 adult Chinese respondents, these measures were examined in relation to a set of relevant independent variables frequently tested in the gambling literature. Cognitive dissonance was expected to have significant negative correlations with traditional Chinese values and family support, and a significant positive correlation with neuroticism. Cognitive dissonance was also expected to be negatively correlated with two personal outcomes, i.e. self-actualization and life satisfaction. The results supported these hypotheses, which confirmed the validity of the new measures, and that cognitive dissonance does indeed exist among Chinese gamblers. The results also found that Chinese gamblers, even though they do gamble, also hold negative attitudes toward gambling, with more cognitive dissonance strongly associated with higher levels of gambling. This provides a new perspective on studying Chinese gambling, and offers a possible strategy to help pathological gamblers, for example, by advising them that their negative beliefs about gambling reflect the positive moral values of their society\\u2019s traditional culture, an approach that may be effective in reducing excessive gambling.\",\"published_in\":\"IAFOR Journal of Psychology & the Behavioral Sciences, Vol 1, Iss 1 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"cognitive dissonance; Chinese; culture; gambling; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"cognitive dissonance; Chinese; culture; gambling; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Robert J.

Cognitive dissonance - the uncomfortable tension we experience when we hold two or more inconsistent beliefs - can hinder our ability to respond optimally to error.The aim of this paper is to describe the effects of cognitive dissonance, a construct developed and tested in social psychology. We discuss the circumstances under which dissonance is most likely to occur, provide examples of how it may influence clinical practice, discuss potential remedies and suggest future research to test these remedies in the clinical context.We apply research on cognitive dissonance from social psychology to clinical settings. We examine the factors that make dissonance most likely to occur. We illustrate the power of cognitive dissonance through two medical examples: one from history and one that is ongoing. Finally, we explore moderators at various stages of the dissonance process to identify potential remedies.We show that there is great opportunity for cognitive dissonance to distort judgements, delay optimal responses and hinder learning in clinical settings. We present a model of the phases of cognitive dissonance, and suggestions for preventing dissonance, reducing the distortions that can arise from dissonance and inhibiting dissonance-induced escalation of commitment.Cognitive dissonance has been studied for decades in social psychology but has not had much influence on medical education research. We argue that the construct of cognitive dissonance is very relevant to the clinical context and to medical education. Dissonance has the potential to interfere with learning, to hinder the process of coping effectively with error, and to make the accepting of change difficult. Fortunately, there is the potential to reduce the negative impact of cognitive dissonance in clinical practice.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-08-08\",\"subject_orig\":\"Education; General Medicine; 3304 Education\",\"subject\":\"Education; General Medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Klein, Jill; McColl, Geoff\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/espace.library.uq.edu.au\\/view\\/UQ:55a6ec0\\/UQ55a6ec0_OA.pdf\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"980aa20833733f32ed04efb9f1899d95f1d71789fb3794f07d30818ddd9aeb58\",\"relevance\":105,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"The University of Queensland: UQ eSpace\",\"repo\":\"ftunivqespace\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"x\":\"-0.0209027038252098\",\"y\":\"0.00436335761131353\",\"labels\":\"980aa20833733f32ed04efb9f1899d95f1d71789fb3794f07d30818ddd9aeb58\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"9af141ac66195facf9a76716b7102ff57405f81e51ffe80bd4156d7dcc80e533\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.ubaya.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jimus\\/article\\/view\\/3441\\/2571; https:\\/\\/journal.ubaya.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jimus\\/article\\/view\\/3441\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.ubaya.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jimus\\/article\\/view\\/3441\",\"title\":\"HUBUNGAN MONEY ATTITUDE DAN COMPULSIVE BUYING PADA PERILAKU BERBELANJA MAHASISWA TERHADAP BARANG FASHION YANG TERGOLONG FASHION BRANDED DENGAN COGNITIVE DISSONANCE AFTER PURCHASE SEBAGAI VARIABEL MODERATOR\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study aims to see the role of cognitive dissonance after purchase as a moderator relationship between money attitude and compulsive buying on the behavior of the students shopping for fashion items classified as fashion branded.

The traditional managerial problems observed across disaster management operations are: non-cooperation among members, disrupted chain of commands, misuse of relief items, lack of information sharing, mistrust and lack of coordination. This study aims to understand the issues affiliated with negative attitude towards disaster management operations using theory of cognitive dissonance. A qualitative investigation was undertaken across 64 districts in Bangladesh. Five constructs were examined for their influences on attitude and behavioural intention of members participating in government emergency supply chain for disaster management. The results indicate that administrative conflict, political biasness and professional growth have significant effects on attitude. Impact of insecurity is non-significant on attitude.

This study examined an alternative mechanism for Beggan's findings in the form of forced compliance cognitive dissonance. Seventy-three participants volunteered for the study (66 females and seven males). Results support the view that cognitive dissonance, accepting ownership of a target that was earlier perceived with negative affectivity, is a sufficient condition to enhance estimates of a target object. Ownership per se was not found to be a sufficient condition to enhance owner's estimates of an owned object. In light of this finding cognitive dissonance is offered as a possible mechanism for explaining the previous reports of a perceived ownership effect. This mechanism may also be applicable to instant endowment and mere ownership phenomena.

I wager on the concept of \\u2018cognitive dissonance\\u2019 to explain why the pope resigned, indicating that a massive clash occurred between the theological ideas Joseph Ratzinger holds about Christian faith and the Church, and the actual situation in which both Christian faith and the Church find themselves. For Ratzinger, Christian faith is in the first instance about conversion, and the Church is called to be a beacon of light and truth, calling the fallen modern world to conversion. It is the same Church, however, which is weakened by sexual and financial scandals, and which is losing at a steady pace public authority. In my analysis, it is precisely because the Church closed in on itself to protect itself from a world perceived as inimical, that it forgot that it is in need of conversion itself, before it can call the world to convert. It is the lack of openness and dialogue, both within the Church and of the Church with the world, which has caused this forgetfulness of conversion and rendered the Church ill-fit and isolated in view of its calling. Stepping down as pope was the way for Pope Benedict to bring about dissonance reduction. It would seem, however, that especially Pope Francis\\u2019 words and deeds to realize a more humble, poorer and dialogical Church, offers a more appropriate way to effectively reduce the cognitive dissonance at hand. ; status: published\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"Conversion; Pope Benedict XVI; Joseph Ratzinger; Cognitive Dissonance; Pope Francis; Dialogue; Modernity\",\"subject\":\"Conversion; Pope Benedict XVI; Joseph Ratzinger; Cognitive Dissonance; Pope Francis; Dialogue; Modernity\",\"authors\":\"Boeve, Lieven\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/lirias.kuleuven.be\\/handle\\/123456789\\/413210\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"a1835564a5a209ac5be50645b32f84779ff49e31009adc7fe250ddc0a41cdb75\",\"relevance\":17,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"KU Leuven: Lirias\",\"repo\":\"ftunivleuven\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Absent bystanders, Disaster management, Emergency supply chain\",\"x\":\"0.474072262932036\",\"y\":\"0.121242835298087\",\"labels\":\"a1835564a5a209ac5be50645b32f84779ff49e31009adc7fe250ddc0a41cdb75\",\"area_uri\":14,\"area\":\"Absent bystanders, Disaster management, Emergency supply chain\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"a672389d415312127b3ff32d31189aa47aea8fae780720a6fc8fa938ed1ffac7\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.research.manchester.ac.uk\\/portal\\/en\\/publications\\/cognitive-dissonance-social-comparison-and-disseminating-untruthful-or-negative-truthful-ewom-messages(bade913b-6b73-4861-b83d-9150dc357e70).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.2224\\/sbp.2014.42.6.979\",\"title\":\"Cognitive dissonance, social comparison, and disseminating untruthful or negative truthful eWOM messages\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this research we explored consumers\\u2019 intentions to provide untruthful or negative truthful electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) messages when undergoing conflicting cognitive dissonance and after experiencing social comparison.

Part 1, Connectionist Models and Simulations of Cognitive Dissonance: an Overview\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Cognitive Dissonance Theory is considered part of the cognitive consistency theories in Social Psychology. They uncover a class of conceptual models which describe the attitude change as a cognitive consistency-seeking issue. As these conceptual models requested more complex operational expression, algebraic, mathematical and, lately, computational modeling approaches of cognitive consistency have been developed. Part 1 of this work provides an overview of the connectionist modeling of cognitive dissonance. At their time, these modeling approaches have revealed that a Computational Social Psychology project would acquire the community recognition as a new scientific discipline. This work provides an overview of the first computational models developed for the Cognitive Dissonance Theory. They are connectionist models based eitheron on the constraint satisfaction paradigm or on the attributional theory.Three models are described: Consonance Model (Shultz and Lepper, 1996), Adaptive Connectionist Model for Cognitive Dissonance (Van Owervalle and Joders, 2002), and the Recurrent Neural Network Model for long-term attitude change resulting from cognitive dissonance reduction (Read and Monroe, 2007). These models, and some others, proved from the very beginning the considerable potential for the development of cognitive modeling of the theories of cognitive dissonance. Revisiting the Cognitive Dissonance Theory once again only proves that this potential is even larger than expected.\",\"published_in\":\"European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities ; 2 ; 3 ; 10-26 ; cognitive dissonance\",\"year\":\"2013-08-01T08:00:02Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Psychology; Psychologie; Social Psychology; Sozialpsychologie; attitude change; cognition; simulation; model; mathematical modeling; psychological theory; cognitive dissonance; cognitive dissonance theory; theory formation; Einstellungs\\u00e4nderung; Modell; Kognition; Modellrechnung; Theoriebildung; psychologische Theorie; kognitive Dissonanz; Dissonanztheorie; 50200; 10700; 29900; 10200\",\"subject\":\"Psychology; Psychologie; Social Psychology; Sozialpsychologie; attitude change; cognition; simulation; model; mathematical modeling; psychological theory; cognitive dissonance; cognitive dissonance theory; theory formation; Einstellungs\\u00e4nderung; Modell; Kognition; Modellrechnung; Theoriebildung; psychologische Theorie; kognitive Dissonanz; Dissonanztheorie;\",\"authors\":\"Voinea, Camelia Florela\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.ssoar.info\\/ssoar\\/handle\\/document\\/34976\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ab0a4f0ac9db7ba0e2254d89b1ae7cdcee6bf03f626c32ea30d5cc7bd7827130\",\"relevance\":120,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"SSOAR - Social Science Open Access Repository\",\"repo\":\"ftssoar\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Cognition, Cognitive consistency, Computational modeling\",\"x\":\"-0.0139980747564673\",\"y\":\"-0.0400951933678484\",\"labels\":\"ab0a4f0ac9db7ba0e2254d89b1ae7cdcee6bf03f626c32ea30d5cc7bd7827130\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Cognition, Cognitive consistency, Computational modeling\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"ae857de04528843e69e75f0960247f37b5434b839ee7109722862fd56ad5ce04\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/irep.ntu.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/31693\\/1\\/PubSub9142_Griffiths.pdf; AUER, M. and GRIFFITHS, M.D., 2018.

In the present study, the participant sample (N = 11,829) was drawn from a Norwegian population that had played at least one game for money in the past six months on the Norsk Tipping online gambling website. Players were told that they could retrieve personalized information about the amount of money they had lost over the previous 6-month period. Out of the 11,829 players, 4045 players accessed information about their personal gambling expenditure and were asked whether they thought the amount they lost was (i) more than expected, (ii) about as much as expected, or (iii) less than expected. It was hypothesized that players who claimed that the amount of money lost gambling was more than they had expected were more likely to experience a state of cognitive dissonance and would attempt to reduce their gambling expenditure more than other players who claimed that the amount of money lost was as much as they expected. The overall results contradicted the hypothesis because players without any cognitive dissonance decreased their gambling expenditure more than players experiencing cognitive dissonance. However, a more detailed analysis of the data supported the hypothesis because specific playing patterns of six different types of gambler using a machine-learning tree algorithm explained the paradoxical overall result.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-06\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"cognitive dissonance; feedback online; exploratory study\",\"authors\":\"Auer, M; Griffiths, MD\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/irep.ntu.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/31693\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"ae857de04528843e69e75f0960247f37b5434b839ee7109722862fd56ad5ce04\",\"relevance\":11,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Nottingham Trent University's Institutional Repository (IRep)\",\"repo\":\"ftnottinghtrentu\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Compulsive buying, Customer expectations, Exploratory study\",\"x\":\"-0.280396739250205\",\"y\":\"0.19570909441313\",\"labels\":\"ae857de04528843e69e75f0960247f37b5434b839ee7109722862fd56ad5ce04\",\"area_uri\":13,\"area\":\"Compulsive buying, Customer expectations, Exploratory study\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"aeeaec6ea6d07b55a8b7b67a43008de38f0009b23c7350c16698e38eebf7f708\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1207\\/s15328023top2001_9; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1207\\/s15328023top2001_9\",\"title\":\"Bringing Cognitive Dissonance to the Classroom\",\"paper_abstract\":\"We describe a classroom procedure that induces cognitive dissonance in students by pointing out inconsistencies between their behaviors and attitudes.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach A survey was conducted among banking customers in India using an online questionnaire. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling and the bootstrapping procedure using the SPSS process macro. Findings Contrary to conventional wisdom, findings of this study suggest that RMO and relationship quality are positively correlated to commitment even after negative publicity. The path between RMO, relationship quality and pro-provider behavior is found to be mediated by commitment. This indirect path is moderated by customers' cognitive dissonance arising out of the negative publicity. Originality\\/value The study establishes the combined roles of RMO and relationship quality in pre-empting the detrimental effects of negative brand publicity. Further, it establishes interactions of cognitive dissonance with these relationship variables, thereby bringing together literature from relationship marketing theory and cognitive dissonance theory.\",\"published_in\":\"Asia-Pacific Journal of Business Administration ; ISSN 1757-4323\",\"year\":\"2022\",\"subject_orig\":\"Public Administration; General Business, Management and Accounting\",\"subject\":\"Public Administration; General Business, Management and Accounting\",\"authors\":\"Banerjee, Shubhomoy; Ghosh, Abhijit\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/apjba-08-2021-0411\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"b24ca1a87023e982d2a83c127c49dd68926fef91dd4ac9aa169f02a918e76822\",\"relevance\":28,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/apjba-08-2021-0411\",\"content_provider\":\"Emerald (via Crossref)\",\"repo\":\"cremerald\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Marketing, Business and international management, Consumer behavior\",\"x\":\"0.00902233590107969\",\"y\":\"-0.260511762371453\",\"labels\":\"b24ca1a87023e982d2a83c127c49dd68926fef91dd4ac9aa169f02a918e76822\",\"area_uri\":2,\"area\":\"Marketing, Business and international management, Consumer behavior\",\"source\":\"Asia-Pacific Journal of Business Administration\",\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":\"1757-4323\"},{\"id\":\"b882f374b02581910aba3f24648ca56d07491ce6a36b767f9c4549793f8b566a\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2466\\/pr0.1994.75.3.1331; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.2466\\/pr0.1994.75.3.1331\",\"title\":\"When Cognitive Dissonance is Also Memory-Based\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this experiment, 118 subjects were asked to recall personal behaviors which were inconsistent with one of their attitudes.

A choice between two similarly valued alternatives creates psychological tension (cognitive dissonance) that is reduced by a post-decisional reevaluation of the alternatives. We measured EEG of human subjects during rest and free-choice paradigm. Our study demonstrates that choices associated with stronger cognitive dissonance trigger a larger negative fronto-central evoked response similar to error-related negativity (ERN), which has in turn been implicated in general performance monitoring. Furthermore, the amplitude of the evoked response is correlated with the reevaluation of the alternatives. We also found a link between individual neural dynamics (long-range temporal correlations\\u2014 LRTC) of the fronto-central cortices during rest and follow-up neural and behavioral effects of cognitive dissonance. Individuals with stronger resting-state LRTC demonstrated a greater post-decisional reevaluation of the alternatives and larger evoked brain responses associated with stronger cognitive dissonance. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive dissonance is reflected in both resting-state and choice-related activity of the prefrontal cortex as part of the general performance-monitoring circuitry.\",\"published_in\":\"The Journal of Neuroscience\",\"year\":\"2017-05-17\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"cognitive dissonance; an eeg; dissonance revised\",\"authors\":\"Colosio, M.; Shestakova, A.; Nikulin, V.; Blagovechtchenski, E.; Klucharev, V.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11858\\/00-001M-0000-002D-293E-8\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c05714ed997ebce3e2055371161ab93d8c3f87ad972ec5a30fae0351467c22e9\",\"relevance\":104,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Max Planck Gesellschaft: MPG.PuRe\",\"repo\":\"ftpubman\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"x\":\"0.0104257622188456\",\"y\":\"0.0209594642672947\",\"labels\":\"c05714ed997ebce3e2055371161ab93d8c3f87ad972ec5a30fae0351467c22e9\",\"area_uri\":3,\"area\":\"Achievement in mathematics, Brand personality, Culture sentiment\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"c8e9149f4e0440b8913c0c2382db5748db68b62d2ea53d6e4761078a4c9201c2\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/goodwoodpub.com\\/index.php\\/ijfam\\/article\\/view\\/56\\/8; https:\\/\\/goodwoodpub.com\\/index.php\\/ijfam\\/article\\/view\\/56; doi:10.35912\\/ijfam.v1i1.56\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/goodwoodpub.com\\/index.php\\/ijfam\\/article\\/view\\/56; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.35912\\/ijfam.v1i1.56\",\"title\":\"Cognitive dissonance and investors\\u2019 decision-making: A review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose: The purpose of this research is to develop a conceptual framework of cognitive dissonance bias that influences the investment decision-making.

These are interpreted as signs of becoming accustomed to risk ; and sometimes thought to reflect a strange lack of concern regarding a danger which is both known and visible. Such attitudes ; which at first sight may seem paradoxical ; can be explained by the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger 1962) : cognitive dissonance exists when the behaviour or the situation experienced by an individual enters into conflict with his knowledge or his beliefs. Cognitive dissonance leads to psychological discomfort ; which the individual normally tries to reduce. These attitudes relating to a reduction of cognitive dissonance therefore constitute a form of psychological adaptation to the risk situation and are not the result of unawareness of the situation. The cognitive dissonance theory thus offers a complementary explanatory element to the classical approach of the American geographers (Burton ; Kates & White 1978). ; Partie II - Acteurs et attitudes Part II - Players and attitudes La dissonance cognitive : facteur explicatif de l'accoutumance au risque Cognitive dissonance : an explanatory factor in becoming accustomed to risk Philippe Schoeneich ; Mary-Claude Busset- Henchoz ; R\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 : On rencontre souvent ; chez les habitants expos\\u00e9s \\u00e0 des dangers naturels ; des attitudes de n\\u00e9gation ou de minimisation du risque ; qui sont interpr\\u00e9t\\u00e9es comme une \\u00ab accoutumance au risque \\u00bb ; et parfois jug\\u00e9es comme une inconscience incompr\\u00e9hensible face \\u00e0 un danger pourtant connu et visible.

Methods: Three focus group interviews were conducted in June 2019. A total of 16 nurses and other healthcare personnel employed in three different nursing homes participated. A semi\\u2010structured interview guide was used during the focus group interviews. Data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive qualitative content analysis. Results: The analysis generated one overarching category \\u2013 \\u2018Tension when facing resistiveness to care\\u2019, which describes the discomfort healthcare personnel experienced when confronted with resistiveness to care in people with dementia \\u2013 and two other categories: \\u2018Attitude change\\u2019 and \\u2018Changing behaviour\\u2019, which describes their strategies to reduce and\\/or manage the discomfort.

Impact: This study addresses cognitive dissonance, a discomfort experienced by healthcare personnel when facing resistiveness to care from people living with dementia. To reduce their dissonance, the participants employed several strategies, including coercive measures, when providing care. The theory of cognitive dissonance may help explain why healthcare personnel sometimes choose to employ coercive measures while providing care. ; acceptedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Advanced Nursing ; 1-32\",\"year\":\"2021-08-25T19:09:49Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Cognitive dissonance; Content analyses; Dementia; Focus group interviews; Healthcare personnel; Care resistiveness; Nursing homes\",\"subject\":\"Cognitive dissonance; Content analyses; Dementia; Focus group interviews; Healthcare personnel; Care resistiveness; Nursing homes\",\"authors\":\"Mortensen, Anne Helene; Stojiljkovic, Marko; Lillekroken, Daniela\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2787090\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"dbfee34c17c4892777b6052d154ca4a5fcd8f946cd4dce333b6c3740ce673d0b\",\"relevance\":12,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"OsloMet (Oslo Metropolitan University \\/ Storbyuniversitetet): ODA (Open Digital Archive)\",\"repo\":\"fthsosloakers\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Absent bystanders, Disaster management, Emergency supply chain\",\"x\":\"0.124446071965896\",\"y\":\"0.318450514182307\",\"labels\":\"dbfee34c17c4892777b6052d154ca4a5fcd8f946cd4dce333b6c3740ce673d0b\",\"area_uri\":14,\"area\":\"Absent bystanders, Disaster management, Emergency supply chain\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"dd6b26b26e297761fd465f65156f88ae23e7afdc1d29b4fab51d29b3f8d0cff4\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0093650215613136; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/0093650215613136; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/0093650215613136\",\"title\":\"Cognitive Dissonance or Credibility?

Part 1 of this work provides an overview of the connectionist modeling of cognitive dissonance. At their time, these modeling approaches have revealed that a Computational Social Psychology project would acquire the community recognition as a new scientific discipline. This work provides an overview of the first computational models developed for the Cognitive Dissonance Theory. They are connectionist models based either on on the constraint satisfaction paradigm or on the attributional theory.Three models are described: Consonance Model (Shultz and Lepper, 1996), Adaptive Connectionist Model for Cognitive Dissonance (Van Owervalle and Joders, 2002), and the Recurrent Neural Network Model for long-term attitude change resulting from cognitive dissonance reduction (Read and Monroe, 2007). These models, and some others, proved from the very beginning the considerable potential for the development of cognitive modeling of the theories of cognitive dissonance. Revisiting the Cognitive Dissonance Theory once again only proves that this potential is even larger than expected.\",\"published_in\":\"European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities, Vol 2, Iss 3, Pp 10-26 (2013)\",\"year\":\"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"connectionist model; cognitive dissonance; cognitive consistency; Political science; J; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"connectionist model; cognitive dissonance; cognitive consistency; Political science; J; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Camelia Florela Voinea\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/db2ac3b7dd754fcda2b7c09494a2874e\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"e4843718855ccae601a44de2100541e253f32007cf4099ee5091bb11270674ee\",\"relevance\":99,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Directory of Open Access Journals: DOAJ Articles\",\"repo\":\"ftdoajarticles\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Cognition, Cognitive consistency, Computational modeling\",\"x\":\"-0.0140004506422942\",\"y\":\"-0.0400995125613867\",\"labels\":\"e4843718855ccae601a44de2100541e253f32007cf4099ee5091bb11270674ee\",\"area_uri\":1,\"area\":\"Cognition, Cognitive consistency, Computational modeling\",\"source\":\"European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities\",\"volume\":\"2\",\"issue\":\"3\",\"page\":\"10-26\",\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"e507cd99b9f342d9e2518e1250e9f53ca8cdba16562a866cc4b1b7b3e34d07ba\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2466\\/pr0.1965.17.3.801; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.2466\\/pr0.1965.17.3.801\",\"title\":\"Cognitive Dissonance and Self-Confidence Level\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Hall and Closson studied psychoanalytic judgments, which produced a situation roughly similar to one described by Myers: in both studies, contrary results would be predicted by reinforcement and cognitive dissonance views.

In our opinion, these issues are mainly due to operational and methodological weaknesses that have not been sufficiently addressed since the beginnings of the theory. We start by reviewing the ambiguities concerning the definition and conceptualization of the term cognitive dissonance. We then review the ways it has been operationalized and we present the shortcomings of the actual paradigms. To acquire a better understanding of the theory, we advocate a stronger focus on the nature and consequences of the cognitive dissonance state itself. Next, we emphasize the actual lack of standardization, both in the ways to induce cognitive dissonance and to assess it, which impairs the comparability of the results. Last, in addition to reviewing these limits, we suggest new ways to improve the methodology and we conclude on the importance for the field of psychology to take advantage of these important challenges to go forwards.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 10 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"cognitive dissonance; replication crisis; operationalization; measurement; theory; methodology; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"cognitive dissonance; replication crisis; operationalization; measurement; theory; methodology; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"David C.

Cognitive dissonance is a defense mechanism to avoid psychological discomfort when the evidence is inconsistent with one\\u2019s prior perception. Such cognitive constraints may limit analysts\\u2019 attention to certain stocks or information. We use preceding unfavorable recommendations to proxy analysts\\u2019 negative perceptions and find that analysts delay their incorporating positive signals into the recommendations. This paper contributes to the analyst behavior literature by providing empirical evidence that analysts\\u2019 underreaction to new information for unfavorable category stocks is partly attributable to the cognitive dissonance. The documented significantly longer duration for the recovering stocks is consistent with the effectiveness of contrarian investment strategies.

The dimensions of customers\\u2019 expectations has been classified as expectation on quality, expectation on after sales service, expectation on customer consideration, expectation on offers\\/promotions, and expectation of price. The study revealed that when expectation of price, expectation of offers\\/promotions and expectation on after sales service are high or very strong, then the chance for cognitive dissonance are also very high, and other two expectations such as expectation on quality and expectation on customer consideration have not been found as important in generating cognitive dissonance.DOI: http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.4038\\/jm.v8i1.7547 Journal of Management 2013 8(1): 1-13\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Management; Vol 8, No 1 (2013); 1-13\",\"year\":\"2014-10-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"Management; Marketing management; Cognitive dissonance; Customer expectations;\",\"subject\":\"Management; Marketing management; Cognitive dissonance; Customer expectations;\",\"authors\":\"Hamza, V K; Zakkariya, K A\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.sljol.info\\/index.php\\/JM\\/article\\/view\\/7547\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"fbcda9b318e6167d5fd0f9851c6d23b21cf96f7b1e1f2a4b930e8d8a3380038f\",\"relevance\":9,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"Sri Lanka Journals Online (SLJOL)\",\"repo\":\"ftjsrilankajo\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Compulsive buying, Customer expectations, Exploratory study\",\"x\":\"-0.219486402708934\",\"y\":\"0.292303812416972\",\"labels\":\"fbcda9b318e6167d5fd0f9851c6d23b21cf96f7b1e1f2a4b930e8d8a3380038f\",\"area_uri\":13,\"area\":\"Compulsive buying, Customer expectations, Exploratory study\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"fc9e705dbf53970e467732ae7f9912b718014d3cb233954d155499e77ac98aae\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/kar.kent.ac.uk\\/62489\\/1\\/Cognitive_dissonance__social_comparison__and_disseminating_truthful_negative_and_untruthful_eWOM_messages.pdf; Liu, Y-L, Keng, Ching-Jui (2014) Cognitive dissonance, social comparison, and disseminating untruthful or negative truthful eWOM messages.

We recruited 480 Taiwanese Internet users to participate in a scenario-based experiment. The findings show that after making downward comparisons on the Internet, consumers with high cognitive dissonance were more inclined to disseminate negative truthful eWOM messages compared to consumers with low cognitive dissonance. After making upward comparisons, it was found that consumers with high cognitive dissonance were more likely to make untruthful eWOM statements compared to those with low cognitive dissonance. It is recommended that marketers monitor eWOM in an effort to reduce the incidence of consumers' negative truthful and untruthful eWOM messages.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2014-07-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"cognitive dissonance; comparison disseminating; disseminating untruthful\",\"authors\":\"Liu, Y-L; Keng, Ching-Jui\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/kar.kent.ac.uk\\/62489\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"fc9e705dbf53970e467732ae7f9912b718014d3cb233954d155499e77ac98aae\",\"relevance\":112,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\",\"content_provider\":\"University of Kent: KAR - Kent Academic Repository\",\"repo\":\"ftkentuniv\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Comparison disseminating, Disseminating untruthful, Electronic word-of-mouth\",\"x\":\"-0.168411900276729\",\"y\":\"-0.0928909432575214\",\"labels\":\"fc9e705dbf53970e467732ae7f9912b718014d3cb233954d155499e77ac98aae\",\"area_uri\":5,\"area\":\"Comparison disseminating, Disseminating untruthful, Electronic word-of-mouth\",\"source\":null,\"volume\":null,\"issue\":null,\"page\":null,\"issn\":null},{\"id\":\"fd7d7c700a8f7e470a47daf2440333fbc1701363ce5696786fbc7f474b595591\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.lincoln.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/6335\\/1\\/34286727.pdf; Burke, Shaunna M., Sparkes, Andrew C. and Allen-Collinson, Jacquelyn (2008) High altitude climbers as ethnomethodologists making sense of cognitive dissonance: ethnographic insights from an attempt to scale Mt Everest.
