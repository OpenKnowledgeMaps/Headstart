The Maori Party, in particular, should be afraid, very afraid. The main hall of the Kelston Community Centre was packed to the gunnels. There was not so much a buzz of excitement as a raging ferment of noise as the audience waited patiently for proceedings to begin. Say what you like about Kim Dotcom.

This paper analyzes the success and failure of six dot-com enterprises in context of the Internet Strategy Model. According to Porter, there are two fundamental factors that determine profitability and eventual business success: industry structure and sustainable competitive advantage. When applied to our sample companies, it becomes clear that the pure-plays (or pure dot-com enterprises) do not have any advantages over their counterparts, the clicks-and-mortar (or companies that operate, an Internet e-commerce channel in addition to their established storefronts). By lowering the barrier to entry and intensifying the rivalry among competitors, the pure-plays increase the bargaining power to consumers, giving up their chance of gaining and holding a sustainable competitive advantage. This paper utilizes a qualitative approach to show how ignoring fundamental strategic principles as outlined by Porter have contributed to the demise of the pure-plays. It draws the results from theoretical reviews and analysis of corporate data to investigate the comparison of six dot-com companies, three of them Internet pure-plays and three clicks-and-mortar hybrids. The results of this qualitative analysis will help us to outline what strategies did or did not work with the pure-plays and the clicks-and-mortar? Our analysis will hopefully provide answers to this question.\",\"published_in\":\"Vision: The Journal of Business Perspective ; volume 5, issue 1_suppl, page 4-13 ; ISSN 0972-2629 2249-5304\",\"year\":\"2001\",\"subject_orig\":\"Strategy and Management; Business and International Management\",\"subject\":\"Strategy and Management; Business and International Management\",\"authors\":\"Humphrey, Curt R.; Motiwalla, Luvai\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/09722629010050s102\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"9382c79e55bfececaf884d556aedbfcd45f7e700b90ae0448205e8453dc555a7\",\"relevance\":476,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/09722629010050s102\"},{\"id\":\"83ec4b551b6d617d4fe3d8bfbf2e9a93d3b3bda87d4cd063de810a84d44262e5\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0258042x0102600205; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/0258042X0102600205\",\"title\":\"Job Satisfaction of Dotcom Employees ; An Indian Experiment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The internet revolution has initiated a distinctive \\u201cclick model\\u201d of business operation.

When the lift reaches its climax, and the market prices of the shares are maximally inflated, a quick decline and crisis begin. \\\"Dot-com\\\" boom (companies that have engaged in sales of goods and services via the Internet) was preceded by a long economic upswing of the 1990s, one of the largest lifts of the twentieth century. Information technology was at the forefront of it, especially the mass proliferation of the Internet since the mid- 1990s. A large number of new Internet companies appears, the majority of which wanted to receive money from the issue of shares, regardless of whether a business of selling goods and services via the Internet would be profitable. As is the case with all joint-stock boom that took place earlier, this approach led to the \\\"dot-com\\\" crisis of March 10, 2000. On the NASDAQ stock market, where most of the \\u00abdot-com\\u00bb shares traded, a rapid drop in their rates began. The huge losses are evidenced by the fact that during 2000, the NASDAQ index fell almost 50 %. If there were over three hundred \\u00abdot-coms\\u00bb in 1999, in 2001, only 76 left. The total capitalization of the \\u00abdot-com\\u00bb shares, part of the Bloomberg US Internet index, fell after the crisis by 1,755 trillion dollars, and the market prices of most stocks declined in 2000 by 80\\u201390 %. Due to the speed of the fall in stock prices, the \\\"dot-com\\\" crisis can be compared with the \\u00abGreat crash\\u00bb of 1929. Although the crisis was short-lived and two years later it was replaced by a new rise, the \\u00abdot-com\\u00bb crisis began the sequence of events that led to large-scale global crisis of 2007\\u20132009. Nobody wanted to hinder the heated market of securities, so the \\u00abdotcoms\\u00bb were superseded by the mortgage boom of the mid-2000s.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u041f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0431\\u043b\\u0435\\u043c\\u0438 \\u0442\\u0435\\u043e\\u0440\\u0456\\u0457 \\u0442\\u0430 \\u043c\\u0435\\u0442\\u043e\\u0434\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0457 \\u0431\\u0443\\u0445\\u0433\\u0430\\u043b\\u0442\\u0435\\u0440\\u0441\\u044c\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043e\\u0431\\u043b\\u0456\\u043a\\u0443, \\u043a\\u043e\\u043d\\u0442\\u0440\\u043e\\u043b\\u044e \\u0456 \\u0430\\u043d\\u0430\\u043b\\u0456\\u0437\\u0443, Vol 2, Iss 40, Pp 44-47 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u00abdot-com\\u00bb; Internet companies; economic recovery of the 1990s; the \\u00abdot-com\\u00bb crisis of 2000; Accounting.

Using the dotcom as a context, this paper argues that the attractiveness of an entrepreneurial opportunity depends on the extent to which it eliminates customer dissatisfaction with the existing alternatives. Building on this logic, the paper examines how dotcoms can work towards elimination of customer dissatisfaction. A close analysis of these businesses shows that many of them did not have a sound business model and that many of their assumptions were questionable. This paper attempts to provide an explanation of dotcom failures using newly developed concepts such as mature latent need, zero customer dissatisfaction and the customer dissatisfaction chain. It argues that many firms failed because they did not establish whether there existed any customer dissatisfaction and hence the opportunity for a dotcom firm to eliminate this dissatisfaction. Furthermore, when they focused on eliminating dissatisfaction at one point firms did not see their capabilities to provide overall positive value. The paper concludes that dotcoms and in turn VCs can be real winners if they apply the logic and concepts discussed here.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2003\",\"subject_orig\":\"Entrepreneurship; Marketing; Business Strategy\",\"subject\":\"Entrepreneurship; Marketing; Business Strategy\",\"authors\":\"Ramachandran, K\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.exchange.isb.edu\\/\\/id\\/eprint\\/14\\/\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"2bb77c8b0f5203cfac16095a527d032cee41273b7fc620bb73cfc6b0b88d993c\",\"relevance\":460,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"4fb1bd1a40b188ace9b78a6a26e3b564dbc8d01c86f713e0d0723d213d3e31b6\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1080\\/02683960110100418; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1080\\/02683960110100418\",\"title\":\"After the Goldrush: Deconstructing the Myths of the dot.com Market\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Many would claim that the development of electronic commerce is reshaping almost all industries, even to the extent that we are undergoing a paradigm shift.

Taking the approach of critical political economy, this narrative is contextualized as an outgrowth of broader social trends, namely the increased importance and interconnection of marketing communications, media technologies, and finance within a changing capitalism.\",\"published_in\":\"Publications and Research\",\"year\":\"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"internet advertising; finance; dotcom bubble; political economy; marketing communications; internet history; Communication Technology and New Media; Critical and Cultural Studies; Film and Media Studies; Public Relations and Advertising\",\"subject\":\"internet advertising; finance; dotcom bubble; political economy; marketing communications; internet history; Communication Technology and New Media; Critical and Cultural Studies; Film and Media Studies; Public Relations and Advertising\",\"authors\":\"Crain, Matthew\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/academicworks.cuny.edu\\/qc_pubs\\/157\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"ecdc0f8d245fae15958430e0b08d1b65e036d018ef5f20a9fad26c30de295a35\",\"relevance\":455,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"d0c24780bb11c8d5e54817dba8e39125e9dafde589694a24b1bd2728b541548a\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5367\\/000000003101299366; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.5367\\/000000003101299366\",\"title\":\"Dot-Com Women Entrepreneurs in the UK\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Drawing on two areas of academic interest, female entrepreneurship and the Internet sector, this paper provides an overview of female entrepreneurship in the Web-based business sector in the UK.

In 2001 soon after the Asian Crises of 1997-1998, the DotcomBubble, 9\\/11, the Enron crises triggered a fraud crisis in Wall Street that impacted the market to the core. Since then scandals such as the Lehman Brothers and WorldCom in 2007-2008 and the Great Recession have surpassed it, Enron still remains one of the most important cases of fraudulent accounting. In 2000\\u2019s even though the financial industry had become highly regulated, deregulation of the energy industry allowed companies to place bets on future prices. At the peak of the dotcom bubble Enron was named as a star innovator but when the dotcom bubble burst, Enron\\u2019s plan to build high speed internet did not flourish and investors started to realize losses. Furthermore, the financial losses of the operations were hid using the market to market accounting technique instead of book value and using special purpose entities to hide debt. The root cause that was identified as a company with a toxic corporate culture focused on officer compensation rather than social responsibility and hence faulty leadership.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach The study constructs a conceptual framework of repetition in signifiants (from rhetoric) and signifi\\u00e9s (from philosophy, notably Barthes, Deleuze, Eliade and Jank\\u00e9l\\u00e9vitch). Signifiants are established by reference to rhetorical figures based in repetition: anadiplosis, anaphora, alliteration\\/rhyme and lists. Signifi\\u00e9s are indicated as conscious rhetorical emphasis, and unconscious reflections of sameness and difference; networks and links; and, of particular interest during the \\u201cdot.com\\u201d years, exuberance and compulsion; differentiation, ritual and reassurance. The framework is used to analyse BT plc's Annual Reviews from 1996\\u20102001. Findings The application of the framework is enlightening: repetition is shown to be prevalent in BT plc's Annual Reviews , especially during the \\u201cdot.com\\u201d years. Repetition emphasises BT plc's intangible assets; less consciously, repetition reflects BT plc's corporate identity and its participation in the \\u201cdot.com\\u201d era. Research limitations\\/implications The paper provides a model which may be applied to the wealth of discretionary narratives and pictures in contemporary annual reporting. It would also benefit from the assessment of readership impact. Practical implications The analysis is of interest to accounting researchers, practitioners, trainees, auditors and any user of accounting and accountability statements. It illuminates the way in which discretionary words and pictures highlight and supplement accounting information.

The examination found that successful DotComs overcame the technical, operational and behavioral shortcomings of their failed counterparts and led the way in logistics, customer support, Web design, promotion and Internet security.\",\"published_in\":\"Information Management & Computer Security ; volume 12, issue 3, page 228-244 ; ISSN 0968-5227\",\"year\":\"2004\",\"subject_orig\":\"Library and Information Sciences; Management Science and Operations Research; Business and International Management; Management Information Systems\",\"subject\":\"Library and Information Sciences; Management Science and Operations Research; Business and International Management; Management Information Systems\",\"authors\":\"Razi, Muhammad A.; Tarn, J.

When the lift reaches its climax, and the market prices of the shares are maximally inflated, a quick decline and crisis begin. \\\"Dot-com\\\" boom (companies that have engaged in sales of goods and services via the Internet) was preceded by a long economic upswing of the 1990s, one of the largest lifts of the twentieth century. Information technology was at the forefront of it, especially the mass proliferation of the Internet since the mid- 1990s. A large number of new Internet companies appears, the majority of which wanted to receive money from the issue of shares, regardless of whether a business of selling goods and services via the Internet would be profitable. As is the case with all joint-stock boom that took place earlier, this approach led to the \\\"dot-com\\\" crisis of March 10, 2000. On the NASDAQ stock market, where most of the \\u00abdot-com\\u00bb shares traded, a rapid drop in their rates began. The huge losses are evidenced by the fact that during 2000, the NASDAQ index fell almost 50 %. If there were over three hundred \\u00abdot-coms\\u00bb in 1999, in 2001, only 76 left. The total capitalization of the \\u00abdot-com\\u00bb shares, part of the Bloomberg US Internet index, fell after the crisis by 1,755 trillion dollars, and the market prices of most stocks declined in 2000 by 80\\u201390 %. Due to the speed of the fall in stock prices, the \\\"dot-com\\\" crisis can be compared with the \\u00abGreat crash\\u00bb of 1929. Although the crisis was short-lived and two years later it was replaced by a new rise, the \\u00abdot-com\\u00bb crisis began the sequence of events that led to large-scale global crisis of 2007\\u20132009. Nobody wanted to hinder the heated market of securities, so the \\u00abdotcoms\\u00bb were superseded by the mortgage boom of the mid-2000s. ;

Design\\/methodology\\/approach A conditional international CAPM with asymmetric multivariate GARCH-M specification is used to estimate international diversification gains. Findings The authors find that over the entire sample period, the average gains from international diversification is statistically significant and about 1.253 percent per year. During the subprime crisis period, the average gains decreases to about 0.567 percent per year, but it increases to 2.829 percent per year during the dot-com crisis. Research limitations\\/implications These research findings although confirm the conjectures that international financial turmoil tends to increase the co-movements among global financial markets, are in contrast to the conjectures that international diversification does not work during the financial crisis as evidence from the dot-com crisis. Therefore, future research on international diversification should not just focus on the correlation among international financial markets and should adopt a fully parameterized asset pricing model to study this research topic. Practical implications Given the empirical results found in this paper that international diversification gains may be decreasing or increasing during the financial crisis, as long as investors are not able to predict international financial crises, it is the average gains from international diversification over the longer periods that should encourage investors to diversify, regardless of potentially lower benefits over the shorter periods of time. Originality\\/value The major value of this paper is that although the increase in the conditional correlation during the financial turmoil is consistent with previous studies, the empirical results clearly show that the impact of a financial crisis on the gains from international diversification cannot be solely determined by the correlation between domestic and world stock market returns since the gains also depend on the unsystematic risk from the domestic stock market. Consequently, it is premature for previous studies to conclude that the gain from international diversification is diminishing due to an increasing correlation among international stock markets during the financial crisis.\",\"published_in\":\"Managerial Finance ; volume 44, issue 12, page 1434-1445 ; ISSN 0307-4358\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous); Finance\",\"subject\":\"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous); Finance\",\"authors\":\"Tai, Chu-Sheng\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/mf-11-2017-0477\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"c7842b71d8699b9852e3a73b48992705e597127fee1a0886e527ad786b9f661e\",\"relevance\":406,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/mf-11-2017-0477\"},{\"id\":\"b37f91dbcbec7af865d924d495c704b03899bd153b33ce7ab0760a83777fd8e6\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/1185335.1185346; https:\\/\\/dl.acm.org\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1145\\/1185335.1185346\",\"title\":\"Hostile work environment.com ; increasing participation of underrepresented groups, lessons learned from the dot-com era\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Data is presented from three cases studies of three small IT-focused businesses that were created and failed within the context of the Dot-Com era (1996-2001). This era can be characterized as a time in which the IT industry was facing an acute shortage of employees and yet, as the analysis shows, chose to create a culture that hired a gender, racially, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous workforce. From evidence drawn from interviews, observations, self-reported organizational charts and time diaries, I argue that the organizational cultures, created by the owners and managers of these three companies, made it nearly impossible for female employees to be hired trained and retained.. I also claim that once a small number of female employees were hired, the organizational culture made the work environment so hostile, it drove these employees to leave and seek alternative employment. The owners and managers of these three IT companies used the myths that were readily available in the wider American culture of the time to construct an organizational culture that would motivate and manipulate their employees. This culture may have satisfied the immediate needs of the Dot Com industry but were disastrous for traditional protectionist measures that protected women in the workforce, recruited and retained women in the workforce, and make the IT workplace hospitable to a variety of people, including women. The conclusions that I draw from this case study are that in the case of this business, the Dot-Com Bubble did more to impede entrance to women into the IT workforce than to facilitate it.\",\"published_in\":\"ACM SIGMIS Database: the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems ; volume 37, issue 4, page 79-98 ; ISSN 0095-0033 1532-0936\",\"year\":\"2006\",\"subject_orig\":\"Computer Networks and Communications; Management Information Systems\",\"subject\":\"Computer Networks and Communications; Management Information Systems\",\"authors\":\"Tapia, Andrea Hoplight\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/1185335.1185346\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"b37f91dbcbec7af865d924d495c704b03899bd153b33ce7ab0760a83777fd8e6\",\"relevance\":405,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1145\\/1185335.1185346\"},{\"id\":\"f32c59e11206053233ae07cdcd69278ea9b076d4335e88852642239cf64f4d7b\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5446\\/20917; https:\\/\\/av.tib.eu\\/media\\/20917\",\"title\":\"Sex and the Internet ...\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\\"Exposure.

This will be done by building up an analysis of the position of labour-time in the creation of absolute and relative surplus-value and the determination of the make-up of the organic composition of capital with specific reference to the circumstances which saw a financial bubble develop around the so-called New Economy of fledgling tech, telecommunications, ICT and internet start-ups in the US during the late nineties and early noughties. Utilising quantitative and qualitative data including government statistics and ethnographic accounts to illustrate the operation of Marxian analytical categories, the paper will assess the usefulness of Marx\\u2019s conceptualization of labour-time and crisis to an analysis of the US economy over the period described, and gauge to what extent it requires recalibration to adequately grasp the changes in the organization of capitalist production identified in the research. Whilst much of the evidence provided will reveal that Marx\\u2019s theorization is still of considerable exactitude and relevance to contemporary capitalism, there nonetheless remain certain aspects of the New Economy that his economic work are at a loss to comprehend. On the one hand, the Marxist tradition is still a valuable framework through which to view the global economy. Yet, on the other, contemporary capitalism possesses many qualities that require that tradition to be updated in order to help us understand and interpret changes in the way in which wealth is generated. Chief among these is the increasingly immeasurable nature of labour-time in the context of primarily intangible and immaterial processes of production. It is argued that autonomist Marxism presents a strong example of the way in which Marx's original categorizations can be reconfigured to form a theoretical perspective adequate to these new circumstances, which can be combined critically and fruitfully with the earlier theoretical paradigm to illuminate contemporary conditions of labour and capitalism.\",\"published_in\":\"Pitts , F H 2013 , ' Labour-time in the Dot.Com bubble : Marxist approaches ' , Fast Capitalism , vol. 10 , no. 1 .\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"Labour; crisis; labour-time; Work; New Economy; Marxism; Marxian; Marx; \\/dk\\/atira\\/pure\\/subjectarea\\/asjc\\/3300\\/3301; Social Sciences (miscellaneous); \\/dk\\/atira\\/pure\\/subjectarea\\/asjc\\/3300\\/3312; Sociology and Political Science\",\"subject\":\"Labour; crisis; labour-time; Work; New Economy; Marxism; Marxian; Marx; Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Sociology and Political Science\",\"authors\":\"Pitts, Frederick Harry\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/researchportal.bath.ac.uk\\/en\\/publications\\/labourtime-in-the-dotcom-bubble(d0ac3814-2f75-4d38-8b4e-699b286693fb).html\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"88327bf3bd6cca9b2938d57891fc881e95518d4e87a21f6c12262b24dd57b2f3\",\"relevance\":394,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9cb83fa568f7c69dbbebd39054c458d6f7b546bcfdc6f4124a1fc4d678a2423b\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/097215090600700203; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/097215090600700203\",\"title\":\"Changes in Managerial Work ; Tech Managers at Dotcom\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article seeks to examine how recent structural and organizational changes could have had an impact on the role and work of managers in contemporary organizations with support of empirical data gathered from a case study undertaken in India.

In particular, we focus on the 2000 DotCom Bubble, the 2008 Housing Crisis, and the 2015 Chinese Bubble. We employ three main empirical methods; the LPPL model to identify asset bubbles, the DCC-GARCH model to measure volatility clustering, and the Diebold-Yilmaz volatility spillover index to measure the level of financial contagion. We provide robust evidence that during the DotCom bubble there was very limited spillover between the S&P 500, the Shanghai, and the Shenzhen Composite Indexes. However, there was significantly more spillover effects in the two more recent crises, i.e., the Housing crisis and the 2015 Chinese Bubble. Together, these results highlight the fact that as financial markets have become more globalized, there are greater levels of volatility transmission and correspondingly fewer potential benefits from international diversification.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Risk and Financial Management, Vol 14, Iss 229, p 229 (2021)\",\"year\":\"2021-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"financial contagion; volatility clustering; spillover effects; bubble; Risk in industry.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach Using a broad sample of stock options traded on the American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange from January 2001 to December 2010, the effect of different idiosyncratic volatility forecasting measures are examined on future stock returns in four different periods (Bear and Bull markets). Findings First, the authors find clear and robust empirical evidence that the implied idiosyncratic volatility is the best stock return predictor for every sub-period both in Bear and Bull markets. Second, the cross-section firm-specific characteristics are important when it comes to stock returns forecasts, as the latter have mixed positive and negative effects on Bear and Bull markets. Third, the authors provide evidence that short selling constraints impact negatively on stock returns for only a Bull market and that liquidity is meaningless for both Bear and Bull markets after the recent financial crisis. Practical implications These results would be helpful to disclose more information on the best idiosyncratic volatility measure to be implemented in global financial crises.

We use a dynamic multivariate framework to estimate time-varying correlations, which we submit to beta and sigma-convergence analysis. Subsequently we examine how convergence dynamics affect portfolio risk management and crisis propagation. Our results show strong convergence of Islamic and conventional investments. During crises conventional convergence rates double, but Islamic ones are less affected. Sectoral diversification works best for conventional investments; Islamic ones behave as a single entity. On average we document a 7% risk diversification benefit from Islamic investments, at a 64 basis points cost. Yet, at the epicentre of the Covid-19 financial crisis this rises to 466 basis points and highlights the resilience of these investments in an exogenous event.

The dot-com bubble in the beginning of the millennium, the US house pricing bubble of 2006 that culminated in the recent global nancial crisis and the 2015 stock market bubble in China are but few examples for apparent inefficiencies if not outright failures of financial markets to correctly reflect asset prices. Investors acting in sync have been suspected to cause such unwanted market phenomena, compare e.g Wermers (1999). The destabilizing character of investor coordination has been made explicit in the theoretical literature under herding. The term refers to the behavior of individual investors following the decision of the majority or crowd despite of being endowed with information that advises them to take a different action (see Brunnermeier (2001), p.148). The claim that such behavior adversely affects financial markets is intuitive.

The third industrial revolution started as early as the beginning of the 1970s and has continued to this day. It is shaped using electronics and information technologies (IT) in the economy and progressive standardization and automation of business processes. While exponential growth is typical for the IT sector, this is rarely the case for the classic industries. For a long time, the change was barely perceivable, which led many players to denounce these developments as uninteresting, losing interest at an early stage. But then, as the process picks up breakneck speeds, it often becomes impossible to jump on board or keep up. When automation driven by electronics and IT established itself in production, it led to dramatic changes in value chains and employment structures. Through standardization and automation, business processes became more efficient, quicker, and transparent. When the dot-com speculative bubble burst in 2000, vending machines that ordered supplies independently were already in operation. In the search for the business model of the Information Age, electronic marketplaces became popular pioneers for dynamic business networks and real-time business. Many of today\\u2019s well-known technology firms \\u2013 such as Google, Netflix, or the predecessors of Facebook \\u2013 were already active on the market in a similar form. In recent years a second wave of digital transformation is experienced and with it, a fourth industrial revolution. The necessary information and communication technologies have now become so cost-effective that they can be used in widespread areas. As a result, many of the dot-com promises have been realized today.

While the pressure is on to generate income from existing customers and users, portal operators must reach new markets and find realistic revenue streams. This search for real revenues has led to a move towards charging for content, a strategy being pursued by a large number of horizontal portal players, including MSN and Terra Lycos. This trend is particularly noticeable in China, where Chinadotcom operates a mainland portal and plans a range of fee-based services, including electronic mail. The nature of advertising itself is changing, with portals seeking blue-chip sponsorship and marketing deals that span a number of years. Players are struggling to redefine and reinvent themselves as a result of the changing environment and even the term \\u201cportal\\u201d is believed to be obsolete, partly due to its dot.com crash associations. Multi-access portals are expected to dominate the consumer sector, becoming bigger and better overall than their predecessors and playing a more powerful role in the consumer environment. The current generation of business-to-consumer (B2C) portal types generally fall into one of the following categories: horizontal; niche or vertical; wireless; voice; and TV. The future for portals is expected to lie with the development of the multi-access consumer portal market and will probably take place in three key stages: testing the waters (2001-2002); a wave of confidence (2003-2004); and sophistication filtering out (2005-2006).

The largest eigenvalue corresponds to the collective motion of the system as a whole, while the other large, isolated, eigenvalues indicate collectivity in parts of the system. In the case of finance, these are industrial sectors. By removing the collective motion of the system as a whole, the latter effects are much better revealed.

Due to its convenience, firms issue SEOs as their primary capital raising mechanism particularly during economic disruptions i.e., the early 2000s dot-com bubble, 2008 Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19. Using an event study for ASX 200 firms from 1998 to 2020, we show that there is an increased intensity of SEO abnormal return volatility and volume during economic disruptions. We find evidence of abnormal return volatility and volume in standalone and restricted SEOs being higher relative to combined SEOs. We also identify that higher performing sectors experience larger abnormal return volatility and volume. Finally, using an improved measure of abnormal return volatility, we capture the time varying nature of volatility using GARCH and GJR-GARCH estimations. We highlight that the traditional abnormal return volatility measure tends to be overstated for some SEO types and understated for others.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2021\",\"subject_orig\":\"350202 - Finance\",\"subject\":\"- Finance\",\"authors\":\"Prasad, Mason (S34285); Bakry, Walid K.

Unlike other models to detect herding, we use Geweke (1982) type causality tests that allow us to disentangle spurious herding from intentional herding via tests of bidirectional and instantaneous causality across portfolio positions in technology stocks. After controlling information based (spurious) herding, our tests show that 38 percent of large institutional investors tend to intentionally herd in technology stocks. The findings support the existing literature that investment decisions by large institutional investors are not only driven by fundamental information, but also by cognitive bias that is characterized by intentional herding.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Herding; Institutional investors; Causality\",\"subject\":\"Herding; Institutional investors; Causality\",\"authors\":\"Uwilingiye, Josine; Cakan, Esin; Demirer, R\\u0131za; Gupta, Rangan\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10210\\/399899\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"4d96c2317a082dcb9679f2066a37eaafb010e00d4563376254939b0498672dc2\",\"relevance\":286,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"ef4805ed2f57925f0f7ff7fdeca730e290ff9c48a4fefc436b5a3e98e64c244a\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.5367\\/0000000053026428; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.5367\\/0000000053026428\",\"title\":\"Entrepreneurship and Innovation in e-Business ; An Integrative Perspective\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper argues that a combination of entrepreneurship and innovation is a crucial factor for the long-term sustainability of e-commerce and e-businesses.

The first period saw the beginning of internet advertising and media organisations establishing a web presence, before the dot.com crash of 2000. A period of more cautious consolidation of positions then followed, and internet advertising became differentiated into categories of search, directories, classified and display, leading up to the corporate discovery of social networking in 2005.

What I ask in this study is if asset owners always support right-wing parties and a trimmed welfare state. I argue that owners of financial assets become less tempted by free-market policy offerings when there is uncertainty in financial markets. The dot-com bubble, the financial crisis, and most recently the massive impact on financial markets of the coronavirus show that savings can evaporate in a matter of days.

Significant regulatory policy debates are still underway internationally, notably with respect to the treatment of shadow banking.1 But the main contours of the crisis-era regulatory landscape are now clear. Internationally, most major economies, including the EU, have implemented the G20 reform agenda, set out initially in the 2008 Washington Declaration,2 and covering, inter alia: bank capital, liquidity and leverage; hedge funds; rating agencies; and the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. That major regulatory change would have followed the financial crisis is not, of course, a surprise.3 Observation of responses to major financial crises over the years from the 1929 Crash to the \\u2018dotcom bubble\\u2019 era and beyond4 makes clear that what Professor Coffee has vividly described as the \\u2018regulatory sine curve\\u20195 leads to a regulatory boom after financial market bust.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-10\",\"subject_orig\":\"HG Finance; JN Political institutions (Europe); K Law (General)\",\"subject\":\"HG Finance; JN Political institutions (Europe);\",\"authors\":\"Moloney, Niamh\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\\/54593\\/\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"8e5837518e5a16776474ccd2119c1b0508deaba56f02840c23a2fed7457d297f\",\"relevance\":236,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"b3dbeb6cec5bb39b4d17446c4e632fbfee539f9311012f1abb0eb83d244b4ee6\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dialnet.unirioja.es\\/servlet\\/oaiart?codigo=7139733; (Revista) ISSN 1807-1775\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dialnet.unirioja.es\\/servlet\\/oaiart?codigo=7139733\",\"title\":\"New times, new strategies: proposal for an additional dimension to the 4 P'S for E-commerce dot-com\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Proper marketing management is fundamental to any business endeavor, including dot-coms. However, to date, as identified in a review of the International Journal of Electronic Commerce (IJEC) production and the last 10 years of EnANPAD (EnANPAD is the annual Brazilian Academy of Management conference). There are no works on the applicability of the 4P's to e-commerce, a gap in the literature that this study proposes to fill. It uses a qualitative approach methodology, investigating several empirical studies about digital commerce, and comparing it with the mainstream strategic marketing literature. Inferences were developed, pushing further the theory boundaries of this field. Both the classical works as those from Borden (1964) and Mccarthy (1960) and many other contemporaries are evaluated. The present research utilizes these works as a source of information and data. Using a process of comparison with the marketing mix model, it searches for a possible lack of fit between the related empirical environments and such a model. The results identify several key variables in each of the P's related to security in electronic commerce. This dimension seems to be the key in shaping the perception of customer value, thus supporting its inclusion as a fifth dimension along with the 4P's.\",\"published_in\":\"JISTEM - Journal of Information Systems and Technology Management, ISSN 1807-1775, Vol. 12, N\\u00ba. 1, 2015, pags. 107-124\",\"year\":\"2015\",\"subject_orig\":\"e-commerce; marketing mix; dot-com; electronic marketing\",\"subject\":\"e-commerce; marketing mix; dot-com; electronic marketing\",\"authors\":\"Gonetecki Oliveira, Maximiliano; Machado Toaldo, Ana Maria\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dialnet.unirioja.es\\/servlet\\/oaiart?codigo=7139733\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"b3dbeb6cec5bb39b4d17446c4e632fbfee539f9311012f1abb0eb83d244b4ee6\",\"relevance\":186,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"afbe7c09972cb273a6a0c646f7f4e2525ae3be5ecdae242e4966cb1824018657\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/firstmonday.org\\/htbin\\/cgiwrap\\/bin\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/fm\\/article\\/view\\/2139\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10536\\/DRO\\/DU:30051004\",\"title\":\"Web 2.0 : an argument against convergence\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Web 2.0 has been a dominant concept in recent discussion and development of Internet applications, businesses and uses.

These results suggest that the drivers of herding behavior are period and country specific.\",\"published_in\":\"ISSN: 0378-4266 ; Journal of Banking and Finance ; https:\\/\\/hal-audencia.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-01092519 ; Journal of Banking and Finance, Elsevier, 2015, 50, pp.589-598. &#x27E8;10.1016\\/j.jbankfin.2014.03.014&#x27E9;\",\"year\":\"2015-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Herding; Fundamental information; Financial crisis; [QFIN]Quantitative Finance [q-fin]\",\"subject\":\"Herding; Fundamental information; Financial crisis; \",\"authors\":\"Galariotis, Emilios C.,; Spyrou, Spyros I.; Rong, Wu\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hal-audencia.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-01092519\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"321ad61af21d890cb6710a107100f35102cdfc45af2f0a43e7357330c50c3196\",\"relevance\":132,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"cc7d82e4a822ae04150a5f0259ca64d43ac40adf2585c15b5eb58188fe352c7b\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/research.sabanciuniv.edu\\/id\\/eprint\\/16245\\/1\\/ratingpaper_v33newsubmit_ssrn.pdf; Alp, Aysun (2010) Structural shifts in credit rating standards.

I report two main findings: (i) There is a divergent pattern between investment grade and speculative grade rating standards during 1985-2002. Investment grade ratings tighten between 1985 and 2002. In contrast, the speculative grade rating standards loosen during the same period. (ii) There is a sharp structural break in both investment grade and speculative grade standards towards more stringent ratings around 2002. The change in rating levels due to the structural break is both economically and statistically significant. Holding firm characteristics constant, firms experience a drop of 1.5 notches in ratings due to tightening standards between 2002 and 2007. The loosening in speculative grade ratings before 2002 is consistent with widespread criticism of the rating agencies during the Dot-Com crash and appears to be driven by revenue maximization concerns of rating agencies. On the other hand, the 2002 structural break is consistent with rating agencies responding to intense scrutiny. It appears that reputational concerns and threat of regulation led rating agencies to move towards more conservative ratings after the Enron debacle and passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2010-06-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"HG Finance\",\"subject\":\"HG Finance\",\"authors\":\"Alp, Aysun\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/research.sabanciuniv.edu\\/id\\/eprint\\/16245\\/\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"cc7d82e4a822ae04150a5f0259ca64d43ac40adf2585c15b5eb58188fe352c7b\",\"relevance\":125,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"7368add5aa0e6abc2caf1e4b0512f5d7e02cead65fcc5a75bf522b063f51a57a\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/02580540510589648; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/02580540510589648\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/02580540510589648\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"The strategic message from IBM ; Diversify or die\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose Reviews the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoints practical implications from cutting\\u2010edge research and case studies.

This effect is moderated for bankruptcies that are likely driven by macroeconomic shocks such as the dotcom bubble and the global financial crisis. We also show that our findings are not explained by bond issuers with an elevated risk of default and seem instead to be driven by directors serving on key monitoring committees, indicating that prior bankruptcy experience raises concerns about the company\\u2019s corporate governance.

Concurrently, the same actors were also each telling a counter-story of indictment, blaming other groups for the crisis and calling for changes in the institutional order. Institutional entrepreneurship, then, centered on efforts of sense-making through the narration of stories. The three accounts of the high-tech 2000 fall reflected simultaneous efforts of both collaboration in maintaining the institutional order and contestation that could potentially disrupt it.

Applying a theoretical framework derived from the literature on the sociology of work and the transformation of the organization of politics in the Nordic welfare states, we make two theoretical points. First, special advisers are part of an emerging group of partisan policy professionals, and second, the characteristics of this group are best analyzed through the lens of the boundaryless career. By combining these two positions, we contribute to studies on special advisers by offering a longer career perspective, and we contribute to studies on the boundaryless career by analyzing a job market other than the dot-com and cultural industries. Mapping the entire career paths of all Danish special ministerial advisers from 2000 to 2017 ( n = 144), we show that the position of special adviser serves as a stepping-stone to a new labor market that typically culminates with a position in private public relations.

During a relatively short period of just two decades, private pension funds have seen two financial crises (the dot.com crisis at the beginning of the 21st century and the Global financial crisis in 2008), the period of low interest rates following the global financial crisis, and more recently, the negative effects of the corona virus epidemic as well. In such environment, the question is which mechanism is the most efficient one in achieving and maintaining the adequate level of funding for defined benefit occupational pension plans. The paper's aim is to examine the efficiency of investment policies and the policy of increasing contributions in maintaining the long-term funding of the pension fund, by using the VAR model and bootstrap resampling for simulating the observed variables. The empirical results show that the investment policy is the most efficient tool for achieving long-term funding, together with limitations in terms of the aggressiveness of the investment policy.\",\"published_in\":\"Bankarstvo, Vol 49, Iss 2, Pp 10-39 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"occupational pension plans; investment policy; contribution rate policy; funding level; bootstrap resampling; Finance; HG1-9999\",\"subject\":\"occupational pension plans; investment policy; contribution rate policy; funding level; bootstrap resampling; Finance; \",\"authors\":\"Stojkovi\\u0107 Dragan; Lukovi\\u0107 Stevan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5c5b4cf5323148a1bbd7f577ac457754\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"6b67598411bf9e3806359415bab4cc99d4cc591a8cd984cf88725e5c0b89d1a2\",\"relevance\":97,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"277c3976bdfb8bf508ed0fc36de156797a3dd3c8781b8aa7b2e9f608f5ab1e5d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/1911-8074\\/14\\/10\\/503; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1911-8066; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1911-8074; doi:10.3390\\/jrfm14100503; 1911-8074; 1911-8066; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/03ccd1a6d43e413ca76357a0436bb671\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/jrfm14100503; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/03ccd1a6d43e413ca76357a0436bb671\",\"title\":\"A Wavelet Perspective of Crisis Contagion between Advanced Economies and the BRIC Markets\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper investigates the relationship between the BRICs\\u2019 and the advanced economies\\u2019 stock markets from 2000 to 2016 utilizing continuous wavelet transform.

New evidence from wild-bootstrapped nonlinear unit root tests in the presence of heteroskedasticity\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In spite of the extensive research which has already been undertaken, the issue as to whether Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) empirically holds, continues to be strongly debated. Existing studies have been criticized for their reliance on unit root tests which are deemed to suffer from certain weaknesses such as the size distortion bias arising from heteroskedasticity. In this paper, we provide new evidence on PPP based on a new methodology that overcomes this problem. We use the widely accepted KSS (Kapetanios et al., 2003) non-linear unit root tests which we, however, wild bootstrapped. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that the wild-bootstrapped KSS is robust to heteroskedasticity-induced size distortion problem. We apply this method to test PPP across 61 countries over the period 1994 to 2012 - a period characterized by a number of crises such as the Asian Financial Crisis, Russian Crisis, dotcom crisis, Global Financial Crises, among others, and therefore, intense heteroskedasticity. Our results provide strong evidence against PPP.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach The approach is based on discussions with executives. Findings The paper highlights three common reasons why firms choose to cut knowledge management efforts, namely: knowledge management is seen as a luxury, not a necessity; knowledge management is subsumed under information technology methods; and investment in knowledge management does not offer immediate results. Moreover, the paper argues that cutting knowledge management efforts does more harm than good for a corporation in the long run.

It is enacted through capitalism and justified by the association of networked technologies with the political and social benefits of online community, drawing upon narratives that foreground the social and political benefits of networked technologies. I examine its origins in the wake of the dotcom bubble, when technology makers sought to develop a new business model to support online commerce.

After the dot.com crash of 2000, there was a regime change in new firm formation and the number of firms that exited through an initial public stock offering. This change was made possible by the decreased cost, increased speed, and ease of market entry due to availability of open source software, digital platforms, and cloud computing. This facilitated a proliferation of startups seeking to disrupt incumbent firms in a wide variety of business sectors. The contemporaneous growth in the number and size of private funding sources has resulted in a situation within which new firms can afford to run massive losses for long periods in an effort to dislodge incumbents or attempt to triumph over other lavishly funded startups. This has triggered remarkable turmoil in many formerly stable industrial sectors, as the new entrants fueled by capital investments undercut incumbents on price and service. The ultimate result is that new entrants with access to massive amounts of capital can survive losses for a sufficiently long period to displace existing firms and, thereby, transform earlier industrial ecosystems.\",\"published_in\":\"Venture Capital, vol 21, iss 1\",\"year\":\"2019-01-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"Venture capital; mega-funds; unicorns; industry disruption; platform technology; winner takes all; IPOs; Business & Management; Business and Management; Banking; Finance and Investment\",\"subject\":\"Venture capital; mega-funds; unicorns; industry disruption; platform technology; winner takes all; IPOs; Business & Management; Business and Management; Banking; Finance and Investment\",\"authors\":\"Kenney, M; Zysman, J\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/escholarship.org\\/uc\\/item\\/94p5v91r\",\"oa_state\":1,\"url\":\"7e75e14b2fe36eb7946776cc41d4a896d695e0d3ea1cb3864a50b47644005ae4\",\"relevance\":59,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2197744ecca1e5c232a1687277f4d93902d65c29a344ea33fc70551b395454cb\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/rbf-08-2020-0206; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/RBF-08-2020-0206\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/RBF-08-2020-0206\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"Measuring gambling activity in options market\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose This paper investigates how the gambling measure captures market bubble events, and how it predicts stock return and option return.

DESIGN\\/METHODOLOGY\\/APPROACH : Using data on technology stockholdings of 115 large institutional investors, the authors test the presence of herding by examining linear dependence and feedback between individual investors\\u2019 technology stockholdings and that of the aggregate market. Unlike other models to detect herding, the authors use Geweke (1982) type causality tests that allow authors to disentangle spurious herding from intentional herding via tests of bidirectional and instantaneous causality across portfolio positions in technology stocks. FINDINGS : After controlling information-based (spurious) herding, the tests show that 38 percent of large institutional investors tend to intentionally herd in technology stocks. ORIGINALITY\\/VALUE : The findings support the existing literature that investment decisions by large institutional investors are not only driven by fundamental information, but also by cognitive bias that is characterized by intentional herding. ; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/publication\\/issn\\/1940-5979 ; hj2019 ; Economics\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-08\",\"subject_orig\":\"Herding; Institutional investors; Causality; Technology stocks\",\"subject\":\"Herding; Institutional investors; Causality; Technology stocks\",\"authors\":\"Uwilingiye, Josine; Cakan, Esin; Demirer, Riza; Gupta, Rangan\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2263\\/70744\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"e52da9bcc3ac871b601f94f2477af975dd8a90fd7a87481683684aa5d3263b32\",\"relevance\":51,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"17e220be5da3151bdcb2c0391f4846d6c9d907b8dd5c7c6f2d4ec194f6d0f1bf\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/01437730210424093; http:\\/\\/www.emeraldinsight.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1108\\/01437730210424093; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/01437730210424093\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/01437730210424093\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"Downsizing in the Internet industry: the Hong Kong experience\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Since June 2000, dot.com companies in Hong Kong have followed the same pattern of downsizing as their counterparts in the West.

I report two main findings: (i) There is a divergent pattern between investment grade and speculative grade rating standards during 1985-2002. Investment grade ratings tighten between 1985 and 2002. In contrast, the speculative grade rating standards loosen during the same period. (ii) There is a sharp structural break in both investment grade and speculative grade standards towards more stringent ratings around 2002. The change in rating levels due to the structural break is both economically and statistically significant. Holding firm characteristics constant, firms experience a drop of 1.5 notches in ratings due to tightening standards between 2002 and 2007. The loosening in speculative grade ratings before 2002 is consistent with widespread criticism of the rating agencies during the Dot-Com crash and appears to be driven by revenue maximization concerns of rating agencies. On the other hand, the 2002 structural break is consistent with rating agencies responding to intense scrutiny. It appears that reputational concerns and threat of regulation led rating agencies to move towards more conservative ratings after the Enron debacle and passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2012\",\"subject_orig\":\"HG Finance\",\"subject\":\"HG Finance\",\"authors\":\"Alp, Aysun\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/research.sabanciuniv.edu\\/id\\/eprint\\/19817\\/\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"37b3e6ae97930026e737c2e742f012d2cef51df87504c16570509d35807760dd\",\"relevance\":49,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e9f7610467a801899859dbd4e1f26a0eeb2ab68bc718a023087479d9ada75471\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.physa.2012.04.018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.48550\\/arxiv.1103.5189; https:\\/\\/arxiv.org\\/abs\\/1103.5189\",\"title\":\"On interrelations of recurrences and connectivity trends between stock indices ...\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Financial data has been extensively studied for correlations using Pearson's cross-correlation coefficient \\u03c1 as the point of departure.

This may be a timely wakeup call to the accounting profession that the social acceptance of accounting knowledge should not be taken for granted. ; 29 page(s)\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2012\",\"subject_orig\":\"150100 Accounting; Auditing and Accountability; Accountants; Accounting knowledge set; Professionalism; Professions; Research; Research grants\",\"subject\":\" Auditing and Accountability; Accountants; Accounting knowledge set; Professionalism; Professions; Research; Research grants\",\"authors\":\"Clarke, Kevin; Flanagan, Jack; O'Neill, Sharron\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.14\\/174177\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"22f88f55e373e4eb1792db81602653576b61c6beb54acc6294419424e1d996fb\",\"relevance\":22,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"40a4665f56a94c336fabb118d7781030d31b3a5331b66e67984e7e1b5e1d5203\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.1016\\/j.intfin.2021.101423; hal-03347374; https:\\/\\/hal-rennes-sb.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-03347374; doi:10.1016\\/j.intfin.2021.101423\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal-rennes-sb.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-03347374; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.intfin.2021.101423\",\"title\":\"From dotcom to Covid-19: A convergence analysis of Islamic investments\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; This paper goes beyond the extant comparisons of Islamic and conventional investments by econometrically assessing their convergence dynamics, in a dataset spanning over 1996-2020, covering ten business sectors and five episodes of crisis. We use a dynamic multivariate framework to estimate time-varying correlations, which we submit to beta and sigma-convergence analysis. Subsequently we examine how convergence dynamics affect portfolio risk management and crisis propagation. Our results show strong convergence of Islamic and conventional investments. During crises conventional convergence rates double, but Islamic ones are less affected. Sectoral diversification works best for conventional investments; Islamic ones behave as a single entity. On average we document a 7% risk diversification benefit from Islamic investments, at a 64 basis points cost. Yet, at the epicentre of the Covid-19 financial crisis this rises to 466 basis points and highlights the resilience of these investments in an exogenous event. Islamic investments reduce volatility spillovers in the financial system, but they are progressively less insulated across time. Our findings withstand a battery of robustness checks and are primarily useful to policy makers and investors.\",\"published_in\":\"ISSN: 1042-4431 ; Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money ; https:\\/\\/hal-rennes-sb.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-03347374 ; Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, Elsevier, 2021, pp.101423. &#x27E8;10.1016\\/j.intfin.2021.101423&#x27E9;\",\"year\":\"2021-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"Convergence; Contagion; Crisis; Difference-in-difference; Dynamic correlation; Economy sectors; Islamic finance; Portfolio; [QFIN.GN]Quantitative Finance [q-fin]\\/General Finance [q-fin.GN]\",\"subject\":\"Convergence; Contagion; Crisis; Difference-in-difference; Dynamic correlation; Economy sectors; Islamic finance; Portfolio; \",\"authors\":\"Alexakis, Christos; Kenourgios, Dimitris; Pappas, Vasileios; Petropoulou, Athina\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hal-rennes-sb.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-03347374\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"40a4665f56a94c336fabb118d7781030d31b3a5331b66e67984e7e1b5e1d5203\",\"relevance\":9,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9b21ebc0d4863d78abf404d180bff7d641b719c5d712433ad5cbd1e137f4ba1b\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/09513571211275461; http:\\/\\/www.emeraldinsight.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1108\\/09513571211275461; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/09513571211275461\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/09513571211275461\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"Hedge funds and unconscious fantasy\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose This paper aims to help explain the rapid growth in aggregate hedge fund assets under management until June 2008 followed by their subsequent dramatic collapse in terms of the conflicting emotions such investment vehicles evoke, and, from this, to consider the implications of the excitement\\u2010generating potential underlying all financial innovations. Design\\/methodology\\/approach Within the framework of critical discourse analysis, this paper explores how hedge funds were represented in the financial press, manager interviews, investor comments, and Congress hearings, before and after the burst of the hedge fund \\u201cbubble\\u201d. The authors then draw on the psychodynamic literature, and frame the human unconscious need for excitement in this discourse. Findings The paper finds evidence demonstrating how hedge funds were transformed in the minds of investors into objects of fascination and desire with their unconscious representation dominating their original investment purpose. Based on a psychoanalytic interpretation of financial markets, and dot.com mania in particular, the authors show how hedge fund investors' search for \\u201cphantastic objects\\u201d and the associated excitement of being invested in them can become dominant, resulting in risk being ignored. Research limitations\\/implications The authors take an interdisciplinary perspective drawing on the insights of the psychoanalytic understanding of unconscious fantasies, needs and drives as these relate to investment activity. Practical implications Public policy implications are that stricter ethical guidelines for the hedge fund industry need to be introduced, and suitability regulations that go beyond mandatory transparent disclosure of investment risks are required. Originality\\/value The paper is one of very few studies concerning investors' emotional attachment to financial innovations, and builds on the emerging field of emotional finance. The conclusions and implications discussed in the paper go beyond any single financial market or product.\",\"published_in\":\"Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal ; volume 25, issue 8, page 1244-1265 ; ISSN 0951-3574\",\"year\":\"2012\",\"subject_orig\":\"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous); Accounting\",\"subject\":\"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous); Accounting\",\"authors\":\"Eshraghi, Arman; Taffler, Richard\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/09513571211275461\",\"oa_state\":2,\"url\":\"9b21ebc0d4863d78abf404d180bff7d641b719c5d712433ad5cbd1e137f4ba1b\",\"relevance\":6,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/09513571211275461\"}]",
