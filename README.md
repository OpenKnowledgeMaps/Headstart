# Head Start

Head Start is a web-based knowledge mapping software intended to give researchers  a head start on their literature review (hence the name). It comes with a powerful backend that is is capable of automatically producing knowledge maps from a variety of data, including text, metadata and references.

## Getting Started

### Client
To get started, clone this repository. Next, duplicate the file `config.example.js` in the root folder and rename it to `config.js`.

Make sure to have `npm` version 6.11.3 installed (it comes with Node.js 10.17.0, best way to install is with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), `nvm install 10.17.0`) and run the following two commands to build the Headstart client:

    npm install
    npm run dev

We are using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to build our client-side application. `webpack` is started in *watch mode* which means that changes to files are tracked and the created `headstart.js` is automatically updated.

Now you can run a local dev server:

	npm start

To run Headstart on a different server (e.g. Apache), you need to set the publicPath in `config.js` to the URL of the `dist` directory:
* Dev: specify the full path including protocol, e.g. `http://localhost/headstart/dist`
* Production: specify the full path excluding protocol, e.g. `//example.org/headstart/dist`

Point your browser to the following address:

	http://localhost:8080/examples/local_files/index.html

If everything has worked out, you should see the visualization shown above.

See [client configuration](doc/README.md) for details on adapting the client.

 Also see visualization [options](doc/README.md#visualisation-settings).

### Server

See [Installing and configuring the server](doc/server_config.md) for instructions on how to install and configure the server. Also, see [HOWTO: Get the search repos example to work](doc/howto_search_repos.md).

## Features

* Interactive, web-based knowledge maps based on [D3.js](https://d3js.org), following Shneiderman's principle of "overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand"
* Synchronized list representation of documents complementing the knowledge map
* Integrated PDF viewer and annotation tool, courtesy of [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is)
* Powerful server component written in PHP and R for the creation of knowledge maps, including algorithms for clustering, ordination and labelling
* Connectors to a number of academic search engines through [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), including [BASE](https://base-search.net), [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), [PLOS](https://plos.org) and [DOAJ](https://doaj.org)
* Persistence and versioning system based on SQLite


## Showcases

* [Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org/): Creates a visualization on the fly based on a user's search in either BASE or PubMed.
* [VIPER - The Visual Project Explorer](https://openknowledgemaps.org/viper/): Provides overviews of research projects indexed by OpenAIRE.
* [CRIS Vis](https://ois.lbg.ac.at/en/cris-I-research-questions): Enables the exploration of crowd-sourced research questions related to mental health.
* [Overview of Educational Technology](https://openknowledgemaps.org/educational-technology): A working prototype for the field of educational technology based on co-readership.
* [OpenUP Dissemination Toolbox](https://www.openuphub.eu/tools): A prototype showcasing an overview of innovative dissemination case studies.
* [Conference Navigator 3](http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/cn3/visualization.php?conferenceID=131) [registration required]: An adaptation of Head Start for the conference scheduling system CN3. This version enables users to schedule papers directly from the visualization. Scheduled papers and recommended papers are highlighted.

## Compatibility

The visualization has been successfully tested with Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer is not supported due to the fact that it is not possible to insert HTML into a foreignObject.
