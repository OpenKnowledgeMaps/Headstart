Brain Banks are biorepositories of central nervous system (CNS) tissue including fixed and frozen whole brains, brain biopsies and spinal cord, as well as body fluids comprising the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood stored for research purposes. Though several independent brain banks exist in high income countries, only five low- and middle - income countries (LMIC) have brain banks. The African continent is yet to establish a formalized brain bank despite its huge human genomic diversity, ageing of her populations with concomitant increases in ageing - associated brain disorders and differential phenotypic expression and outcomes of brain disorders. Cellular and molecular clinicopathological studies are vital to shape our understanding of the interaction between racial (genetic) and geographical (environmental) factors in the natural history and mechanisms of disease, and unraveling frameworks of diagnostic biomarkers, and new therapeutic and preventative interventions. The Ibadan Brain Ageing, Dementia And Neurodegeneration (IBADAN) Brain Bank, the first organized brain tissue biorepository in sub - Saharan Africa, is set up to accrue, process and store unique brain tissues for future research into a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

A registered nurse was the coordinator in each center. We screened asymptomatic population aged between 50 and 75 years. Immunological fecal occult blood test (FIT) was offered to all participants. Subjects with positive FIT underwent colonoscopy.A total of 12,668 individuals were enrolled, with a FIT compliance rate of 93.9% and 2,358 colonoscopies were performed. Two hundred and fifty high-risk adenomas and 110 cancer cases were diagnosed. One patient died before treatment due to cardiovascular disease, 74 patients (67%) underwent endoscopic resection and 35 had surgical treatment. Ninety one percent of patients had an early stage CRC (0-I-II). Among colonoscopy indicators, 80% of cases had an adequate bowel preparation (Boston > 6), cecal intubation rate was 97.7%, adenoma detection rate was 36.5%, and in 94.5% of colonoscopies, withdrawal time was adequate (> 8 min).This CRCS pilot model was associated to a high rate of FIT return and colonoscopy quality standards. Most CRCs detected with the program were treated by endoscopic resection.

Household and 24hR estimates were standardized and harmonized for 33 dietary indicators, including 9 food groups, total energy, 8 macronutrients, and 15 micronutrients. Individual consumption was estimated from household data using two approaches, the Adult Male Equivalent (AME) and per capita (PC) approach. For each dietary indicator, differences in household vs. individual mean estimates were evaluated overall and by strata of individual characteristics, using Spearman's correlations and univariate and multivariate linear regression models.Individualized household estimates overestimated individual intakes from 24hR for all dietary factors using either estimation method (P<0.001 for each), except for starchy vegetables (AME: P = 0.15; PC: P = 0.85). For foods, overestimation ranged from 4% for seafood to about 240% for fruits, and for nutrients from 11% for carbohydrates and poly-unsaturated fats to 55% for vitamin C, with similar overestimation for the AME and the PC method. By strata, overestimation was modestly higher in men vs. women, in children (0-10y) vs. adolescents (11-19y) and adults (20-44y, ≥45y), among adults of higher (≥6y) vs. lower (<6y) education, in Muslims vs. other religions (Christians, Hindus), and for the lowest vs. all other income groups. This overestimation was notably higher in young children (0-5y) vs. all other age groups and in the lowest vs. all other income groups.

Physical activity (PA) helps preventing diabetes complications by keeping the blood sugar of T2DM patients within the normal range. The objective of this study was to explore underlying beliefs corresponding to PA in T2DM patients using health action process approach (HAPA).This cross-sectional study was conducted in Isfahan, 2015. A convenience sample of 203 participants with T2DM was collected. Participants completed HAPA inventory containing the following constructs: Risk perception, outcome expectation, task self-efficacy, intention, action and coping planning, coping self-efficacy, recovery self-efficacy, and PA questionnaire.

The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been increasing globally in the recent decades. Physical activity (PA) helps preventing diabetes complications by keeping the blood sugar of T2DM patients within the normal range. The objective of this study was to explore underlying beliefs corresponding to PA in T2DM patients using health action process approach (HAPA).This cross-sectional study was conducted in Isfahan, 2015. A convenience sample of 203 participants with T2DM was collected.

Multivariate analyses identified determinants of early discussions.Among 490 physicians (response rate = 57%), 167 (35%) would discuss the option of forgoing anticancer treatment \"now (at the diagnosis).\" Physicians' attitudes toward discussing the option \"now\" were significantly correlated with a greater physician-perceived importance of life completion (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.00-1.69, p = 0.048) and dying in a preferred place (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.01-1.65, p = 0.045) for a good death, and not perceiving EOLd as being severely distressing for patients/families (OR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.54-0.95, p = 0.021). In multivariate analyses, independent determinants of the attitude toward discussing the option now included a greater physician-perceived importance of life completion for a good death (OR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.05-1.81, p = 0.019), and not perceiving EOLd as being severely distressing for patients/families (OR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.52-0.94, p = 0.017).Reflection by oncologists on their own perception regarding a good death and beliefs about EOLd may help oncologists individualize the timing of discussing the option of forgoing anticancer treatment.

Switzerland has no national organised mammography screening programme, but regional programmes were progressively introduced since 1999, giving the opportunity to conduct a nationwide quasi-experimental study. We examined the evolution of socioeconomic inequalities in mammography screening in Switzerland and if exposure to regional organised programmes reduced socioeconomic inequalities. Data of 10,927 women aged 50 to 70 years old were collected from the Swiss Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey repeated 5 times (1992-2012). Socioeconomic characteristics were assessed using education, income, employment status, and occupational class. Adjusted prevalence ratios of up-to-date mammography screening were estimated with Poisson regressions and weighted for sampling strategy and non-participation bias.

GINA defined criteria for asthma control include asking about daytime symptoms, limitation of activity, nocturnal symptoms/awakenings and need for reliever treatment. Effective asthma control is necessary for preventing exacerbations and worsening of lung function. Standardized and validated questionnaires such as asthma control test (ACT) help to assess the level of asthma control. Asthma control is classified as controlled, partially controlled or uncontrolled. Multicenter studies like REALISE and AIRE give health care professionals information about effectiveness and adherence to medication over nearly 15 years. Asthma is still poorly controlled in more than 50 % of patients despite the availability of very effective drugs. Low adherence to the treatment, fear of systemic side effects related to long term treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, inadequate knowledge of the disease may be responsible factors for bad asthma control.

Epidemiological studies have linked outdoor PM2.5 concentrations to a range of health effects, although people spend most of the time indoors. To better understand how individuals' exposure vary as they move between different indoor and outdoor microenvironments, our study investigated personal PM2.5 exposure and exposure intensity of 14 adult volunteers over one week (five weekdays and one weekend), using low-cost personal monitors, recording PM2.5 concentrations in 5 min intervals. Further, the study evaluated community perception of air pollution exposure during the recruitment and engagement with the volunteers. We found that people with tertiary education across all ages had greater interest in participating, with younger people being interested regardless of the level of education. The derived exposures and exposure intensities differed between weekdays and the weekend due to larger variations in individuals' daily routines. In general, time spent at home and engaged in indoor activities was associated with the highest personal PM2.5 exposure and exposure intensity on both, week and weekend days, implying the significance of both duration of the exposure and the indoor PM2.5 concentrations. The results showed no relationship between personal exposures and indoor characteristics of home (ventilation, building age and cooktop), which are expected to be due to the study's small sample size. The observed PM2.5 > 10 μg m-3 were significantly higher for distances <50 m to the roads for both major and minor roads, and were observed in areas with <16% open space, which were also close to a major road.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of current study is to assess the cross-sectional association of chronic non-communicable diseases (diabetes mellitus, arthritis, asthma, chronic lung disease, angina, and stroke) with both diagnosed and undiagnosed depression in the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 1, a study of adults in six low- and middle-income countries.A total of 41,810 participants, aged ≥ 18 years, were included. Depression status was assessed by standard methods derived from the World Mental Health Survey (WHH-CIDI). Undiagnosed depression was defined as a depressed person who did not report history of diagnosis/treatment for depression. Associations between depression/undiagnosed depression and chronic diseases, adjusting for country of residence, demographics and chronic diseases risk factors were assessed.Depression was detected in 2508 (6.0%) cases, from whom 2098 (87%) were undiagnosed. Diabetes (Odds ratio:1.47[95%CI:1.24,1.75]), arthritis (2.14[1.82,2.52]), asthma (3.36[2.73,4.14]), chronic lung disease (3.74[3.10,4.51]), angina (3.20[2.66,3.85]), and stroke (3.14[2.55,3.86]) were associated with depression (p-values < 0.001). Being older, female, underweight, and having lower education, and lower income were positively associated with depression. The estimated odds ratios were similar for undiagnosed depression.Cross-sectional design of study prevent us to determine whether depression followed exposures in time. About 12% of the participant did not have data for depression status and were excluded from the study.Most depression cases were undiagnosed.

Psychiatric co-morbidity is a common condition, partly due to the overlap of symptoms in the categorical diagnosis of mental disorders. The co-occurrence of schizophrenia (SZ) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common and challenging co-morbid condition. Also, the relationship between SZ and OCD remains unclear.The aim of this study was to describe the co-morbidity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) among schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compare clinical characteristics of schizophrenia patients with versus without comorbid OCD.A cohort-study was carried out on 396 patients enrolled between November 2011 to June 2014 at the Department of Psychiatry, Rumeilah Hospital in Qatar. We employed the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI), and Structured clinical interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) for diagnoses, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist for scoring OCD. Patients were grouped in SZ patients with and without comorbid OCD (SZ-OCD vs SZ).396 subjects were interviewed. Age of SZ-OCD patients was 42.69 ± 14.33 (years old) whereas SZ patients without OCD ranged 41.59 ± 13.59 years old. There were statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between SZ with and without OCD : age (p = 0.010), BMI (body mass index; p = 0.011), education (p = 0.033), employment (p = 0.019), cigarette smoking (p = 0.039), sheesha smoking (p = 0.008), and prevalence of consanguinity (p = 0.043). In particular, the rate of consanguinity in the current generation was 31.8% [95% CI = 29.1-34.7]. Also, there were statistically significant differences at Hamilton Depression score, General Health Score, Clinical Global Impression- Score, duration of illnesses, and Global Assessment of Functioning (p < 0.001). The results show that anxious, mood and psychotic dimensions rated higher among SZ - OCD ones than SZ only patients.This study confirms that SZ-OCD is a common co-morbidity and prevalence of SZ OCD is higher among patients reporting a degree of consanguinity. Even if this condition is under-recognized in clinical practice, it may significantly change SZ presentation and outcome since psychopathological dimensions report higher scores in the co-morbidity sample.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

School-related factors have been found to be associated with adolescents' suicidal ideation and behaviors, including teacher and peer support. Research has tended to ignore the nested nature of school-related data, which may be critical in this context. The current study implemented a multi-level approach on data from the 2013-14 Health Behaviors in School-aged Children (HBSC-WHO) Israeli survey among high school children (N = 4241; 56% female). Participants completed measures of teacher-, peer-, and parental-support (coded reversely from 1 = high to 5 = low), and suicidal ideation and behaviors in the last 12 months. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM), controlling for gender and age, revealed that classroom-level teachers' support was significantly related to students' suicidal ideation and behaviors (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.20-2.44; OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.04-1.86; respectively), whereas parental (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.40-1.75; OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.30-1.55; respectively) and peer support (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.12-1.31; OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02-1.21; respectively) were significant at the individual-level. The school environment can play a significant role in reducing risk for suicidal ideation and behaviors.

Prenatal exposure to maternal metabolic complications has been linked to offspring neurodevelopmental problems. However, no studies investigating these links have examined the role of maternal prenatal diet.To determine if prenatal exposure to maternal adiposity or hyperglycemia is associated with neurodevelopmental problems in 3-4 year old children, and if links persist following adjustment for confounding variables, including prenatal diet.808 mother-child pairs from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals-Child Development Plus cohort were used to examine associations between pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), hyperglycemia and offspring verbal, performance and full-scale IQ scores, as well as internalizing and externalizing problems. Associations were examined before and after adjustment for prenatal diet along with home environment, maternal depression, education and prenatal smoking. Semi-partial correlations were examined post-hoc to assess the impact of each confounder in the adjusted models.In the unadjusted models, BMI and hyperglycemia predicted lower verbal and full-scale IQ. BMI was also linked to externalizing problems. However, associations were not significant after adjustment. In adjusted models, post-hoc analysis revealed that prenatal diet and home environment accounted for significant variance in verbal and full-scale IQ. The home environment and maternal depression accounted for significant variance in externalizing problems.In the adjusted models, maternal metabolic complications were not associated with offspring neurodevelopment. Even while adjusting for well-known risk factors for adverse offspring cognition (home environment, maternal depression), we show for the first time that maternal prenatal diet is an important confounder of the links between maternal metabolic complications and offspring cognition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The key to reducing mortality from skin cancer depends on early detection and treatment, which, in many cases, means a patient should be informed and possess the self-efficacy necessary to seek expert opinion. The purpose of this study was to determine the readability of skin cancer materials on the Internet using the commonly used readability tests.This is a cross-sectional study.A search was conducted using the key words 'skin cancer.' The first 15 pages of websites that contained English language articles on skin cancer comprised the sample for this study. All English language articles appearing on these websites were analyzed using the Readable.io service to automate popular readability scores. For each article, it was determined if it was generated from a .org, .com, .gov, .net, .edu or other source. Five readability tests were conducted on the materials to determine the ease with which one can read each article.Of the 102 websites sampled, none received an acceptable score on all five assessments. In fact, more than 90% of the websites sampled received an unacceptable score on any one of the five assessments, and more than 78% of the websites sampled received an unacceptable level on all five assessments. All five readability assessments demonstrated statistically significant results; each P-value obtained from the t-tests was substantially below 0.01 and, hence, below the α = 0.05 threshold. These results indicate that it is unlikely that skin cancer websites are being written at the recommended level. Of the websites sampled, roughly 42% were .com, and slightly more than 36% were .org. Statistical evidence indicated that neither .com nor .org websites are likely to be written at the acceptable level.Both for-profit and non-profit agencies which aim to provide health information to consumers should be mindful of the readability levels of the materials they disperse.Copyright © 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health.

We surveyed Ebola knowledge, attitudes and perceptions (KAP) among the institute's healthcare workers.This was a cross-sectional survey.The study consisted of a self-administered paper-based anonymous questionnaire that included 24 closed-item questions and two scales of personal concern.Respondents were generally well informed; compared to nurses, doctors recorded a 1.9-fold higher rate of correct responses regarding Ebola transmission (P < 0.001), but both nurses and doctors correctly identified Ebola's aetiological agent. Nurses perceived higher personal (P = 0.008) and family (P < 0.001) risk than doctors. Respondents reporting high perceived risks were more likely to be less informed about Ebola (P = 0.019) and its prevention options (P = 0.033). Males were 6.7-fold more likely to volunteer than females (P = 0.001) and so were graduates of higher rather than lower education (1.5-fold more likely, P = 0.017) and doctors than nurses (1.7-fold more likely, P = 0.018).

This study was funded, in part, through an unrestricted gift by the Lincoln College Education and Research Fund to the University of South Florida Foundation.Seventeen manuscripts were included. From these, eight EESs were synthesized within the following categories: epidemiology, amputation level, function, disability, leg length, posture, spinal kinematics, osseointegrated prostheses. Only the EES on epidemiology was supported by evidence at the moderate confidence level given support by eight moderate quality studies. The four EESs for amputation level, leg length, posture and spinal kinematics were supported by evidence at the low confidence level given that each of these statements had some evidence not supporting the statement but ultimately more evidence (and of higher quality) currently supporting the statement. The remaining three EESs that addressed function, disability and osseointegrated prosthetic use were all supported by single studies or had comparable evidence that disagreed with study findings rendering insufficient evidence to support the respective EES.Based on the state of the current evidence, appropriate preventative and particularly, treatment strategies to manage LBP in persons with LEA remains a knowledge gap and area of need for future study.Copyright © 2018.

Few intervention target those with poor sleep health but without a diagnosed disorder. This study aims to examine the efficacy of a combined physical activity and sleep intervention to improve sleep quality in middle-aged adults and its effect on physical activity, depression and quality of life.A three-arm randomised trial with a three-month primary time-point, will be conducted. Adults (N = 275) aged 40-65 years, who report physical inactivity and poor sleep quality, will be randomly allocated to either a combined Physical Activity and Sleep Health, a Sleep Health-Only or a Wait List Control group.

The techniques of Factorial Analysis of Correspondence and Semantic Content were used.On sexuality, only the young women with access to higher education represented the term as a free practice that should not lead to guilt. There was a consensus on chastity, virginity, and sex within marriage as effective means of HIV prevention. It is also representational consensus of the young people that sexual practice is pleasurable, however, condemned by the church, and that AIDS is a preventable disease. Social representations have revealed dissent between men and women, while they consider that the exercise of sexuality should be restricted to marriage, they advocate sexual freedom. As for AIDS, they represent that the syndrome stems from prejudice, and they consider that vulnerability favors contagion.In the consensuses among the young people studied, there are sexist prejudices and stereotypes that influence HIV/AIDS prevention actions. Therefore, health professionals, especially those of Nursing should propose actions aimed at this age group in educational activities about the adoption of preventive practices on safe sex, always considering the social representations around the subject.Copyright© by the Universidad de Antioquia.

Unfortunately, financial restrictions, low adherence rate and variability on colonoscopy standardization hamper the implementation of CRCSP in developing countries.To analyze a multicentric pilot model of CRCSP in Chile.A prospective model of CRCSP was carried out in three cities, from 2012 to 2015. The model was based on CRC risk assessment and patient education. Health care personnel were trained about logistics and protocols. The endoscopy team was trained about colonoscopy standards. A registered nurse was the coordinator in each center. We screened asymptomatic population aged between 50 and 75 years. Immunological fecal occult blood test (FIT) was offered to all participants. Subjects with positive FIT underwent colonoscopy.A total of 12,668 individuals were enrolled, with a FIT compliance rate of 93.9% and 2,358 colonoscopies were performed. Two hundred and fifty high-risk adenomas and 110 cancer cases were diagnosed. One patient died before treatment due to cardiovascular disease, 74 patients (67%) underwent endoscopic resection and 35 had surgical treatment. Ninety one percent of patients had an early stage CRC (0-I-II).

Few interventions have been shown to improve retention in HIV care. We recently completed a randomized, controlled trial of a peer mentoring intervention, which failed to increase retention in care or HIV suppression. We sought to gain insight into this negative result and elicit suggestions for future interventions. We conducted semi-structured one-on-one interviews with a sub-sample of participants and all available interventionists after completion of the primary study. Interviews were coded by two researchers and thematically analyzed. Participants in the intervention arm (N = 16) reported good rapport with and benefit from peer mentoring and found the mentors helpful in facilitating the transition from hospital to out-patient clinic. Control arm participants (N = 9) reported similar emotional and social support benefits from the health educators. In both arms, ongoing challenges including completing paperwork, securing transportation, and rescheduling missed appointments were cited, along with internalized stigma and lack of will to seek care, despite the mentors' best efforts. Suggested improvements to the intervention included: more frequent contact with interventionists; additional support for mental health problems; and targeting overall health rather than a more selective focus on HIV. Mentors and health educators agreed with the participant-reported barriers and added that some participants were too sick to meaningfully participate in the intervention, while others appeared unwilling to engage with the interventionists in a meaningful way. Mentoring was highly acceptable and felt to be impactful, however it was not sufficient to overcome structural barriers or stigma and low motivation in some participants. The attention control intervention may have had an unintended positive impact. Future interventions should focus on broad aspects of health and well-being.

Accurate national information on dietary intakes, including heterogeneity among individuals, is critical to inform health implications and policy priorities. In low- and middle-income countries, household expenditure surveys constitute the major source of food data, but with uncertain validity for individual-level intakes.To investigate how individualized dietary consumption estimated from household survey data compared with individual-level 24-hr dietary recalls (24hR); and to assess potential heterogeneity by method for individualizing household intakes, dietary indicator, and individual characteristics (age, sex, education, religion, household income).We evaluated data from the 2011-2012 Bangladesh Household Integrated Survey (BIHS), which included household-level consumption data (5,503 households) and individual-level dietary data based on 24hR from these households (22,173 participants). Household and 24hR estimates were standardized and harmonized for 33 dietary indicators, including 9 food groups, total energy, 8 macronutrients, and 15 micronutrients. Individual consumption was estimated from household data using two approaches, the Adult Male Equivalent (AME) and per capita (PC) approach. For each dietary indicator, differences in household vs. individual mean estimates were evaluated overall and by strata of individual characteristics, using Spearman's correlations and univariate and multivariate linear regression models.Individualized household estimates overestimated individual intakes from 24hR for all dietary factors using either estimation method (P<0.001 for each), except for starchy vegetables (AME: P = 0.15; PC: P = 0.85). For foods, overestimation ranged from 4% for seafood to about 240% for fruits, and for nutrients from 11% for carbohydrates and poly-unsaturated fats to 55% for vitamin C, with similar overestimation for the AME and the PC method. By strata, overestimation was modestly higher in men vs. women, in children (0-10y) vs. adolescents (11-19y) and adults (20-44y, ≥45y), among adults of higher (≥6y) vs. lower (<6y) education, in Muslims vs. other religions (Christians, Hindus), and for the lowest vs. all other income groups. This overestimation was notably higher in young children (0-5y) vs. all other age groups and in the lowest vs. all other income groups. Underestimation was rarely observed, for example for milk intake (-56%) in young children (0-5y). The PC approach did not capture heterogeneity in validity of estimation of different dietary factors by age, mainly in children (0-5y, 6-10y). Spearman's correlations between individualized household estimates and 24hR data were higher for the AME (0.30-0.70) than PC (0.20-0.50) approach. Findings were similar with and without multivariate regression, with proportions of variance (R2) in 24hR intakes explained by the AME being generally greater than PC estimates, yet still low to modest.In this national survey, established methods for estimating individual level intakes from household surveys produce overestimation of intakes of nearly all dietary indicators, with significant variation depending on the dietary factor and modest variation depending on individual characteristics. These findings suggest a need for new methods to estimate individual-level consumption from household survey estimates.

The purpose of this formative research, guided by the Integrated Behavioral Model, was to assess men's attitudes and personal agency towards HIV self-testing (HIVST) and confirmatory HIV testing in order to inform the development of the Tanzania STEP (Self-Testing Education and Promotion) Project, a peer-based HIV self-testing intervention for young men in Tanzania. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 men in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania who socialize in networks locally referred to as \"camps\". Men reported privacy, confidentiality, and saving time as the primary reasons for their self-testing interest. Most participants had high perceived control and self-efficacy to self-test and seek confirmatory HIV testing. Nevertheless, men reported concerns related to their ability to perform the test and the potential lack of post-test counseling. Specific recommendations for the intervention included providing HIVST education and pre-test counseling, and using mobile health (mHealth) strategies for participants to reach a healthcare professional for further assistance. The findings suggest that while HIVST is highly acceptable among men in Tanzania, future interventions will need to address the challenges that men may face with HIVST before promoting it as an alternative or supplement to facility-based HIV testing.

Chlamydial infections are common among young women and can lead to serious reproductive health complications. We assessed the risk of reported repeat chlamydial infection among young women in Louisiana and time interval between infections by age and race/ethnicity.We analyzed surveillance data on chlamydial infections reported among women in Louisiana from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015. Multiple reports for the same person were matched using unique codes. Chlamydial infections reported more than 30 days after a previous positive test were considered new infections. Women aged 15-34 years at first infection during 2000-2012 were censored after three years or after they had a repeat infection. Cumulative incidence and incidence rate of repeat chlamydial infection among women were determined by year of first infection. Race- and age-specific results were obtained using stratified analyses.One in four women diagnosed with a chlamydial infection at 15-34 years of age in Louisiana had a reported repeat infection in three years or less. Risk of repeat infection increased for younger women, racial/ethnic minorities, and women in more recent cohorts. Young black women aged 15-19 years in 2012 had the highest risk (44%). Black women also had shorter intervals between infections than white women.Repeat chlamydial infections were common, especially among young black women. The true number is likely higher because surveillance data only count infections that were detected and reported. Comprehensive prevention strategies are needed to address high rates of repeat chlamydial infections among women.

This is a cross-sectional study.To investigate spine surgeons' attitudes regarding preoperative anxiety measurement, management, and responsibility.The vast majority of patients scheduled for spine surgery experience preoperative anxiety. However, there are currently no consensus guidelines for measure or management of preoperative anxiety in spinal operations.An anonymous questionnaire was sent online to spine surgeons of AO Spine North America to capture their views regarding preoperative anxiety.Of 69 complete responses, most respondents were male (n=66, 95.7%), orthopedic surgeons (n=52, 75.4%), and practicing at an academic setting (n=39, 56.5%). Most spine surgeons practiced for at least 20 years (n=52, 75.4%), operated on 100-300 patients per year (n=48, 69.6%), and were attending physicians (n=61, 88.4%). Most did not measure preoperative anxiety (n=46, 66.7%) and would not use a rating scale to measure it (n=38, 55.1%). However, most would discuss it if mentioned by the patient (n=40, 58.0%). Other spine surgeons measured anxiety verbally (n=22, 31.9%) or with a rating scale or survey (n=6, 8.7%). Although preferences for preoperative anxiety management varied, most respondents used patient education (n=54, 78.3%) and permitting family members' presence (n=36, 52.2%) to reduce patient anxieties. Spine surgeons held themselves, anesthesiologists, and patients most responsible to manage preoperative anxiety.The majority of spine surgeons surveyed did not regularly measure preoperative anxiety, but would discuss its management if the subject was broached by the patient. Spine surgeons relied on a variety of methods to manage a patient's anxiety, but most preferred preoperative education and permitting the presence of family members. Responsibility for controlling preoperative anxiety was chiefly allocated to surgeons, anesthesiologists, and patients. Future avenues for research may include developing a preoperative anxiety measurement scale and management protocol specific to spine surgery.Level IV.

Since adherence to a daily PrEP regimen ensures a maximum protection, it is critical to understand GBM's behavioral responses to having missed PrEP doses. We report on qualitative interviews with GBM taking PrEP. We identified three behavioral responses: (1) 59% continued with their next scheduled dose; (2) 49% described \"making up\" for a missed dose by taking medication as soon as possible; and (3) 11% reported \"doubling\" the next PrEP dose. Participants provided potentially contradictory narratives about their sexual behavior after a missed dose: (1) 54% described making no changes; (2) 49% described adjusting their sexual behavior to reduce HIV risk; and (3) 10% said their decision would be contingent upon how many doses were missed.

Associations between osteoarthritis and onset of comorbidity at the three-year follow-up were examined using regression models. Interaction terms and stratified analysis were used to examine moderation.Osteoarthritis was associated with onset of all comorbidities (p<0.05). After adjusting for confounders, osteoarthritis was associated with onset of widespread pain (adjusted odds ratio 2.49; 95% confidence interval 1.96-3.17) and insomnia (1.58;1.14-1.19). Interactions between osteoarthritis and change in income and onset cognitive impairment (p=0.047; onset was higher when income became inadequate), and between osteoarthritis and education and onset widespread pain (p=0.012; onset was higher in those with high levels of education) were significant.Consulters for osteoarthritis were more likely to develop physical and psychological comorbidities than those without osteoarthritis. The moderation analyses indicated that mechanisms to comorbidity differ by socio-economic strata and a need for different approaches to prevent comorbidity for consulters with OA from different levels of deprivation.

Fully adjusted, two-step regression models were built to test the hypothesis that living near (within 250-meters) an improved sidewalk was associated with greater levels of physical activity than not living near an improved sidewalk.The majority of participants were female, non-Hispanic black, low income, low education, and nearly half lived near at least one improved sidewalk.

Elevation in free thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine (T3) and inappropriately normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was consistent with a clinical diagnosis of thyroid hormone resistance. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was negative for a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.

Macrophages have well-characterized roles in skeletal muscle repair and regeneration. Relatively little is known regarding the role of resident macrophages in skeletal muscle homeostasis, extracellular matrix remodeling, growth, metabolism and adaptation to various stimuli including exercise and training. Despite speculation into macrophage contributions during these processes, studies characterizing macrophages in non-injured muscle are limited and methods used to identify macrophages vary. A standardized method for the identification of human resident skeletal muscle macrophages will aide in the characterization of these immune cells and allow for the comparison of results across studies. Here, we present an immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol, validated by flow cytometry, to distinctly identify resident human skeletal muscle macrophage populations. We show that CD11b and CD206 double IHC effectively identifies macrophages in human skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the majority of macrophages in non-injured human skeletal muscle show a 'mixed' M1/M2 phenotype, expressing CD11b, CD14, CD68, CD86 and CD206. A relatively small population of CD11b+/CD206- macrophages are present in resting skeletal muscle. Changes in the relative abundance of this population may reflect important changes in the skeletal muscle environment.

Twelve teams participated in the tournament (each with 23 players), for a total of 276 players. A 19-question online survey was filled out by the team physician after each injury. Each report contained the player's number, the exact time of injury (minute of play), the location and diagnosis of injury as indicated by a previously defined code, and its severity in terms of the number of days of absence from training and match play.The electronic reporting system had a response rate of 100.0%, with 97.2% of questions answered completely. The mean age of injured players was 27 years (range, 21-35 years) and was not statistically significantly different from the overall mean player age (P > .05). There were no significant differences in the frequency of injuries when analyzed by player position (P = .743). The overall rate of injuries was 1.04 per match, with the most common injuries being contusions (42.3%), sprains (7.7%), strains (7.7%), and fractures (7.7%). These injuries were more commonly the result of contact (75.0%) than noncontact (25.0%) mechanisms (P < .001). Injuries most commonly occurred between the 60th and 75th minute of play when comparing all 15-minute time intervals (P = .004).This study supports the use of electronic injury reporting, which demonstrated a high level of adherence among an international cohort of team physicians and has significant potential for improving injury surveillance and tracking responses to prevention programs.

To evaluate the haemostatic potential of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced liver cirrhosis in Wistar rats.This was an experimental study. Liver cirrhosis was induced in adult female Wistar rats using CCl4. Rats were randomly divided into 6 groups with ten rats in each group: group 1 (normal control group), group 2 (received only CCl4), group 3 (CCl4 + low dose BM-MSCs), group 4 (CCl4 + high dose BM-MSCs), group 5 (CCl4 + silymarin), group 6 (CCl4 + high dose BM-MSCs + silymarin). Thirty days after the treatment, blood samples were collected for liver enzyme level analysis, prothrombin time test and plasma fibrinogen estimations. The rats were then sacrificed, livers were excised and used for histopathological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study.BM-MSCs and the combination treatment of high dose BM-MSCs and silymarin effectively decreased the prothrombin time and increased plasma fibrinogen concentration in rats with CCl4 induced liver cirrhosis. BM-MSCs treatment produces significant anti-fibrotic effect which was supported by the liver enzyme level analysis, histopathology and SEM study.Results indicate that treatment of BM-MSCs in combination with silymarin had a better haemostatic effect when compared to the administration of BM-MSCs alone.

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) influence behavior in real time, in real life. We evaluated trial feasibility and preliminary efficacy of MOMENT, a counseling-plus-EMI to reduce frequent marijuana use in youth in primary care.Primary care patients age 15-24 years using marijuana at least 3 times/week were randomized to MOMENT [motivational enhancement therapy (MET)/smartphone-based momentary assessment/responsive motivational messaging] vs. No-messages (MET/momentary assessment) vs. MET-only. In MOMENT, two MET sessions were followed by 2 weeks of momentary assessment of marijuana use and factors related to use, with motivational messaging displayed after report of marijuana triggers, desire, use, and effort to avoid use. We evaluated study feasibility (recruitment, retention, and response rates; feedback survey responses) and explored intervention effects on marijuana desire and use at three months with linear mixed effects modeling.Seventy youth [mean (M) =20.7 years, 60% female] were assigned to MOMENT (n=27), No-messages (n=15; assignment suspended to enrich other arms), or MET-only (n=28). Most attrition occurred during baseline, before MET. Of those completing MET session 1, 82% completed their assigned treatment and 79% provided 3-month data. Participants highly rated acceptability; comments reflected changing motivation and behavior. Across arms, participants reported significantly lower marijuana use, desire, and problems at follow-up vs. baseline. Momentary marijuana desire declined more in MOMENT vs. MET-only. Marijuana use following a targeted context or behavior was less likely in MOMENT and No-messages, vs. MET-only.The MOMENT intervention is feasible to deliver, acceptable, and potentially efficacious in reducing marijuana desire and use among adolescent and young adults in primary care.

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. According to the Iranian Ministry of Medical Health and Education, out of 100,000 stroke incidents in the country, 25,000 lead to death. Thus, identifying risk factors of stroke can help healthcare providers to establish prevention strategies. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of stroke risk factors and their distribution based on stroke subtypes in Sayad Shirazi Hospital, Gorgan, Northeastern Iran.A retrospective hospital-based study was conducted at Sayad Shirazi Hospital in Gorgan, the only referral university hospital for stroke patients in Gorgan city. All medical records with a diagnosis of stroke were identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, Revision 10, from August 23, 2015, to August 22, 2016. A valid and reliable data gathering form was used to capture data about demographics, diagnostics, lifestyle, risk factors, and medical history.Out of 375 cases, two-thirds were marked with ischemic stroke with mean ages (standard deviation) of 66.4 (14.2) for men and 64.6 (14.2) for women. The relationship between stroke subtypes and age groups (P=0.008) and hospital outcome (P=0.0001) was significant. Multiple regression analysis showed that hypertension (Exp.

Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and is a must-do for all adult Muslims once in their life provided they are able to do it. Considering the 8.8% global prevalence of diabetes, coupled with the number of Muslims performing Hajj (~2.5 million adult Muslims), it could be estimated that Muslims with diabetes performing Hajj may exceed 220 000 per year. According to Islamic rules, Hajj should not cause severe difficulties for Muslims. The Holy Qur'an specifically exempts from this duty Muslims who are unable physically or financially if it might lead to harmful consequences for the individual. This should be applicable to subjects with diabetes considering its severe and chronic complications. During the Hajj, diet, amount of fluid intake and physical activity may be altered significantly. This exemption from the duty is usually not considered a simple permission; Muhammad the Prophet of Islam mentioned, 'God likes his permission to be fulfilled, as he likes his will to be executed'. However, most Muslims with diabetes prefer to do the Hajj duty, and this may cause major medical challenges for Muslims with diabetes and their healthcare providers. So it is very important that healthcare providers are aware of the possible risks that could happen during the Hajj. People with diabetes may face many health hazards during the Hajj, including but not limited to the 'killer triad': hypoglycemia, foot injury and infections. Many precautions are necessary in the prevention and treatment of possible serious complications. Risk stratification, medication adjustments, proper clinical assessment, and education before doing the Hajj are crucial.

The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been increasing globally in the recent decades. Physical activity (PA) helps preventing diabetes complications by keeping the blood sugar of T2DM patients within the normal range. The objective of this study was to explore underlying beliefs corresponding to PA in T2DM patients using health action process approach (HAPA).This cross-sectional study was conducted in Isfahan, 2015. A convenience sample of 203 participants with T2DM was collected. Participants completed HAPA inventory containing the following constructs: Risk perception, outcome expectation, task self-efficacy, intention, action and coping planning, coping self-efficacy, recovery self-efficacy, and PA questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was used for statistical analysis.The common fit indices revealed that the HAPA had an acceptable fit to the observations (CMIN/df = 2.36 [P < 0.001], root mean square error of approximation = 0.089, comparative fit index = 0.891, normal fit index = 0.902). Intention was associated with task self-efficacy (β = 0.92, P < 0.001), whereas risk perception (β = 0.16, P = 0.073) and outcome expectation (β = 0.32, P < 0.081) did not predict intention to participate in PA behavior. PA was well predicted by planning (β =0.84, P < 0.01) while it was not significantly associated to coping self-efficacy (β = 0.66, P = 0.73) and recovery self-efficacy (β = 0.6, P = 0.69).HAPA could be used as a proper framework to identify the beliefs of the patients with T2DM and guide for effective theory-based interventions regarding PA.

Demographic transition has led to rethinking of strategies that are in place to address health issues of the elderly. A study was done to estimate the prevalence and correlates of common mental disorders (CMDs) among the rural elderly in Puducherry. This would help prioritize and plan opportunistic screening for CMDs among the elderly at the primary care level.A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted among all the elderly, n = 243 (60 years and above), from one of the four villages catered by a rural health center in Puducherry. Data were collected at home from subjects using a questionnaire on (1) sociodemographic details and (2) CMDs using the general health questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of CMDs.A total of 243 subjects were studied. Women constituted 63% of the study subjects. The univariable analysis showed that the odds of having CMDs was higher among women (odds ratio [OR] =1.76 [1.03-2.97]), widowed elderly (OR = 2.44 [1.46-4.11]), and among those with a per capita per month income less than USD 19.6 (USD 19.6 to USD 9.9: OR: 4.02 [1.22-13.22]; less than USD 9.9: OR: 3.67 [1.008-13.34]). Elderly with an education of upper primary level (OR: 0.37 [0.33-0.15]) and above (OR: 0.22 [0.22-0.06]) had lower odds of having CMDs compared to those with no formal education. On multiple logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for other confounders, widowed elderly were found to have 2.1 times the odds of having MDs as opposed to elderly with living spouse (OR: 2.107 [CI: 1.09-4.06]).Fifty-one percent of the elderly in our sample suffered from CMD. Widowhood emerged as the single independent predictor of CMDs in this study population.

Dietary phytochemical index (DPI) has introduced as an inexpensive method for quantifying the phytochemicals in foods. For the first time, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship between DPI and the risk of prediabetes.Three hundred participants were assigned to 150 prediabetics (cases) and 150 healthy (controls) groups. Anthropometric values, fasting blood glucose, and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were measured. The DPI was calculated based on data collected from 168-item validated food frequency questionnaire.The sex-specific energy-adjusted DPI was inversely related to fasting blood glucose (FBG) and OGTT (P < 0.001). The odds ratio (OR) of prediabetes was assessed across sex-specific energy-adjusted DPI quartiles. After adjusting for body mass index, physical activity, education, dietary intake of energy, fiber, carbohydrate (% of energy), fat (% of energy), and protein (% of energy), the OR of prediabetes across the sex-specific energy-adjusted DPI quartiles decreased significantly (P-trend < 0.001).We found that higher DPI score is related to lower prediabetes OR. This simple method may be used for the improvement of dietary intake to prevent prediabetes.

The advantage of ingesting fluids during endurance exercise lasting < 90 min has recently been challenged, but literature confirming or disputing this case is limited, particularly for female athletes. This study examined the effects of consuming water versus mouth rinsing with water during a running time trial. Recreationally active female runners (n = 19) completed two, 15-km time trials on an outdoor course in temperate environment (~20ºC; 87% RH) separated by at least one week in a randomized cross-over study design. Participants consumed 355 ml of water (DW) during their run or mouth rinsed (MR) with water from a handheld water bottle every 3 km for 5 s with physiological, perceptual, and affective variables assessed. DW or MR did not affect completion time (79.8 ± 8.1 min and 79.2 ± 8.2 min, p = 0.23), HR (p = 0.35), or RPE (p = 0.73), respectively. Sweat losses were greater (p = 0.03) for DW: 1.47 ± 0.34 L compared to MR: 1.28 ± 0.27 L; however, thirst sensation was not significantly different for MR: 6.7 ± 1.4 compared to DW: 6.2 ± 1.6. A significant effect was exhibited for time (p < 0.01) but not condition for Feeling Scale and Felt Arousal Scale or Energetic and Tense Arousal. Carrying only one smaller fluid container for MR versus a larger or multiple water bottles/backpack systems used for water consumption can reduce fluid load carried during extended duration runs without altering performance or affect for runs of 1.0-1.5 h. MR may also be beneficial to decrease thirst without ingesting fluid for runners that limit exercise fluid consumption because of gastrointestinal discomfort concerns.

There has been increased interest in recent years regarding the utility of imported universal prevention and promotion (P&P) programmes in UK schools, many of which have a coaching model attached. However, there have been relatively few studies exploring the cultural transferability and social validity of these models, even though evidence suggests that these factors are important to the successful implementation of the programmes, and thus the achievement of the intended outcomes. The aim of the current study was to explore the coaching practices that teachers report experiencing, and to further understanding of the perceived benefits of these coaching practices to teachers. The sample consisted of 33 teachers implementing one of two universal, school-based P&P programmes, Good Behavior Game and Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies as part of large-scale, randomised controlled trials. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted, and data were analysed thematically utilising a hybrid approach. Teachers typically reported engaging in six distinct practices with their coaches. While the majority of these practices were in line with coaching literature, there were some discrepancies between intended coaching practices and teachers' reports. The coaching practices were generally perceived to be acceptable to teachers. Two unanticipated practices, validation and motivation, appeared to be of particular value to teachers, although these are not currently a prominent feature in existing coaching models. The findings provide implications for improving the development of socially valid coaching models for UK schools.

The main objective of this study was to identify predictors of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) use in Lebanon. Data for this study were drawn from a national survey conducted among Lebanese adults (n=1500). A modified version of the Social Behavioral Model (SBM) was used to understand CAM use in the study population. In this version, predisposing factors included sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, education, and employment) and Push and Pull factors. Additionally, enabling resources included income, and medical need encompassed presence of chronic disease and perceived health status. Simple and multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the predictors of CAM use in the study population. Results of the multiple logistic regression showed that younger and older adults were less likely to use CAM as compared to middle-aged respondents. The Push factor \"dissatisfaction with conventional medicine\" was associated with higher odds of CAM use. For three of the six Pull factors, compared to participants who strongly disagreed, those who had a tendency of taking care of one's health were more likely to use CAM. Income and presence of chronic disease were also associated with higher odds of CAM use. The findings of this study affirmed the utility of the SBM in explaining the use of CAM and proposed a new version of this model, whereby the Push and Pull factors are integrated within the predisposing factors of this model.

Health education is considered to be essential in the overall care of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); systematic health education integrates individual education not only during hospitalization but also extended care outside of a hospital. To test effectiveness of the systematic health education model for T2DM, we conducted a randomized study with a control group among patients with T2DM living in Nanjing, China.998 eligible patients completed the enrollment and were randomized to systematic health education model and conventional model groups (498 and 500 patients, resp.). The systematic health education model was based on the following aspects: image education, visitation of the exhibition hall, dissemination of educational materials, individualized medical nutrition therapy and exercise programs, WeChat group and regular health lectures, evaluation of complications, lifestyle modification, systematic treatment scheme, self-monitoring of glycemic control, monthly evaluation of the therapeutic effect, proposed improvement measures, and individualized follow-up scheme. The main outcome measures were glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and lipids during the 2-year follow-up.The systematic health education model led to a favorable variation in HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P < 0.05). After adjusted analysis, the HbA1c decreased by 0.67% (P < 0.01) in the systematic health education model, SBP decreased by 10.83 mmHg (P < 0.01), and the level of diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol decreased slightly and was not significant. The BMI did not change significantly during the study in either of the two groups.The systematic health education model is a useful method in the treatment of T2DM because it contributes to decrease in HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and SBP levels, as well as helps in increasing the compliance with the control criteria, except for DBP and BMI.

Disadvantages in educational achievement for minority and immigrant populations may contribute to disparities in cognitive impairment.Examine the role of education in racial/ethnic and nativity differences in cognitive impairment/no dementia (CIND) and dementia among older US adults.Data comes from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study. A total of 19,099 participants aged ≥50 were included in the analysis. Participants were categorized as having normal cognition, CIND, or dementia based on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) or questions from a proxy interview. We document age and educational differences in cognitive status among White, Black, US-born Hispanic, and foreign-born Hispanic adults by sex. Logistic regression is used to quantify the association between race/ethnicity/nativity, education, and cognitive status by sex.Among women, foreign-born Hispanics have higher odds of CIND and dementia than Whites. For men, Blacks have higher odds for CIND and dementia compared to Whites. The higher odds for CIND and dementia across race/ethnic and nativity groups was reduced after controlling for years of education but remained statistically significant for older Black and US-born Hispanic adults. Controlling for education reduces the odds for CIND (women and men) and dementia (men) among foreign-born Hispanics to nonsignificance.These results highlight the importance of education in CIND and dementia, particularly among foreign-born Hispanics.

This review of contingency management (CM; the behavior-modification method of providing reinforcement in exchange for objective evidence of a desired behavior) for the treatment of substance-use disorders (SUDs) begins by describing the origins of CM and how it has come to be most commonly used during the treatment of SUDs. Our core objective is to review, describe, and discuss three ongoing critical advancements in CM. We review key emerging areas wherein CM will likely have an impact. In total, we qualitatively reviewed 31 studies in a systematic fashion after searching PubMed and Google Scholar. We then describe and highlight CM investigations across three broad themes: adapting CM for underserved populations, CM with experimental technologies, and optimizing CM for personalized interventions. Technological innovations that allow for mobile delivery of reinforcers in exchange for objective evidence of a desired behavior will likely expand the possible applications of CM throughout the SUD-treatment domain and into therapeutically related areas (eg, serious mental illness). When this mobile technology is coupled with new, easy-to-utilize biomarkers, the adaptation for individual goal setting and delivery of CM-based SUD treatment in hard-to-reach places (eg, rural locations) can have a sustained impact on communities most affected by these disorders. In conclusion, there is still much to be done, not only technologically but also in convincing policy makers to adopt this well-established, cost-effective, and evidence-based method of behavior modification.

More multiple-therapy was purchased for rhinitis and asthma/COPD patients (4.4%) than for rhinitis only patients (4.0%), with a greater proportion purchased in VIC, SA and TAS (4.7% of rhinitis only patients and 4.5% of rhinitis and asthma/COPD patients) than in other areas. Dual therapy of oral antihistamine (OAH) and intranasal corticosteroid (INS) were the most frequently purchased multiple-therapy, with higher purchasing rates for rhinitis and asthma/COPD patients (2.6%) than for rhinitis only patients (1.6%). The most frequently purchased single therapy was OAH (70.1% of rhinitis only patients and 57.3% of rhinitis and asthma/COPD patients). First-line INS therapy was more likely to be purchased for rhinitis and asthma/COPD patients (15.3% by prescription and 11.7% OTC) than for rhinitis only patients (5.0% by prescription and 9.2% OTC); however, geographical differences in the proportion of therapies purchased OTC were noted, with a lower proportion of OTC OAH and INS purchases in Queensland and the Northern Territory for patients with and without comorbid respiratory disease.Purchases of first-line INS therapy are more likely for patients with comorbid respiratory disease if they have received prescriptions and information/advice from their general practitioner. The study results indicate a need for patient information/education at the point-of-sale of OTC OAHs to enable patients to assess their nasal symptoms and receive treatment support from pharmacists. Greater availability to INSs in pharmacies as well as guidance from current guidelines and instruction in correct intranasal technique may also lead to greater uptake of INSs.

This study explores residents' views of the potential use of a serious game to teach a module on negotiation in practice management and leadership curriculum.The aim of this study was to identify the features required to design a serious game for management and leadership education, including potential scenarios for such a game. Qualitative interviews were conducted with six medical residents. After transcription and coding of data, thematic analysis was used to group the data into four themes, namely: 1) CanMEDS leader competency, 2) personal views about negotiation, 3) views about serious games, and 4) educational needs in a serious game.Our findings revealed that leadership and negotiation were two domains where residents felt they needed additional training. Those who were already familiar with medical applications and had them installed on their smartphones or tablets had a more positive attitude toward gaming than those who did not. The residents were mostly interested in how realistic the content of a serious game was and its ability to combine management and leadership skills with medical knowledge and clinical expertise.The findings in this study demonstrate that serious games have the potential to teach certain aspects of management and leadership. The study shows that residents are receptive to the use of serious games and, if well designed, believe that it can be used to improve their management and leadership competencies.

Enter method of binary logistic regression analysis was used. Regarding qualitative phase, focus group discussions were conducted using the themes of a semi-structured discussion guide. Thematic analysis was used.A total of 156 wheelchair users participated in the quantitative phase. Most study participants had not attended dental care services in the previous year (78.2%). Multivariate analysis found a statistically significant association that indicated that participants who had education level ≤primary education were 3.5 times more likely to had not attended a dental appointment in the previous year (P=0.003). In the qualitative phase, 33 participants were included in 3 focus groups (each comprising 11 participants), they were wheelchair users with education >primary, who did not go to see a dentist in the previous 12 months. Findings of the 3 focus groups suggest generally negative views about Thai dental services for all dimensions of access.This study reflects the unheard voices of wheelchair users and provides rigorous evidence in Thai context that difficulties of access to dental services persist. Policy makers and oral health professionals in oral health system should be alerted to the explicit barriers reported, such that equitable and equal dental services for disabled individuals can be developed.

Parental toy selection and responses to toy play are important factors in children's gender socialization. Reinforcing play with same-gender-typed toys guides children's activities and limits their action repertoires in accordance with gender stereotypes. A survey of 324 Austrian parents of three- to six-year-old children was conducted to investigate parents' judgments about the desirability of different types of toys for their children and how these judgements relate to parents' gender-typing of toys, gender role attitudes, and demographics (age, education, gender). Results show that parents rated same-gender-typed and gender-neutral toys as more desirable for their children than cross-gender-typed toys. The traditionalism of parents' gender role attitudes was not associated with their desirability judgments of same-gender-typed toys, but was negatively related to their desirability judgments of cross-gender-typed toys. This indicates that egalitarian parents permit a greater range of interests and behaviors in their children than traditional parents do. Younger parents, parents with lower educational levels, and fathers reported more traditional gender role attitudes than did older parents, parents with higher educational levels, and mothers. However, no differences based on age, educational level or gender were found in parents' judgments of toy desirability. The present study demonstrates that parents' judgments about the desirability of toys for their children do not accurately reflect their gender role attitudes. This finding highlights the importance of simultaneously investigating different aspects of parents' gender-related attitudes in order to gain a better understanding of parental transmission of gender stereotypes.

The level of education and other adult socioeconomic characteristics of men are known to associate with their fertility, but early-life socioeconomic characteristics may also be related. We studied how men's adult and early-life socioeconomic characteristics are associated with their eventual fertility and whether the differences therein by educational level are explained or mediated by other socioeconomic characteristics. The data on men born in 1940-1950 (N = 37,082) were derived from the 1950 Finnish census, which is linked to later registers. Standard and sibling fixed-effects Poisson and logistic regression models were used. Education and other characteristics were positively associated with the number of children, largely stemming from a higher likelihood of a first birth among the more socioeconomically advantaged men. The educational gradient in the number of children was not explained by early socioeconomic or other characteristics shared by brothers, but occupational position and income in adulthood mediated approximately half of the association. Parity-specific differences existed: education and many other socioeconomic characteristics predicted the likelihood of a first birth more strongly than that of a second birth, and the mediating role of occupational position and income was also strongest for first births. Relatively small differences were found in the likelihood of a third birth. In men, education is positively associated with eventual fertility after controlling for early socioeconomic and other characteristics shared by brothers. Selective entry into fatherhood based on economic provider potential may contribute considerably to educational differentials in the number of children among men.

As health IT supports processes along the entire patient trajectory and involves different types of professional groups, eHealth is inter-professional by nature. The aim of this study, therefore, is to investigate which competencies are at the intersection of the individual groups of health professionals. 718 international experts provided relevance ratings of eHealth competencies for different professional roles in an online survey. Communication and leadership proved to be important competencies across all professions, not only for executives. None or very little differences between professions were found between physicians and nurses, between IT experts at different levels and between IT experts and executives. However, there were a number of competencies rated differently when contrasting direct patient care specialists with executives. These findings should encourage organisations issuing educational recommendations to specify areas of shared competencies more extensively.

The rapid medical and technological progress and the resulting need for life-long learning lead to the proliferation of online-based programs in health informatics for health care and health informatics professionals. Effective learning in these online-based programs demands close interaction and cooperation between students and instructors. In such cooperative online-based programs, special emphasis is thus put on fostering a community of inquiry between all participants. The online-based master program on Health Information Management at the University UMIT is firmly based on the constructivist theory of situated learning in such a community of inquiry. Online activities in this master program are designed to promote social presence, cognitive presence and teacher presence as preconditions for successful learning. To verify whether these three forms of presences are visible and whether learning was successful, the first four six-week online-based modules with overall 60 participants were analyzed in depth, combining data from community of inquiry surveys, student evaluations, workload assessments and final assessment results. Results indicate that it was possible to build a community of inquiry (with scores of 4.2 and higher) and to foster effective learning. We conclude with recommendations on how to build a community of inquiry in online-based cooperative learning and also discuss some constraints.

A low level of patient health literacy represents a major reason for worse prognosis or reduced therapy adherence. Health information booklets are a major tool for improving patient's health literacy. This paper presents a computer-based readability analysis of patient information booklets from the cardiovascular domain. The study relies on 34 English booklets mostly on heart disease, prevention and procedures. It compares five different, well-established readability instruments. On average, readers of the assessed booklets have to visit school at least until the 9th U.S. school grade when applying the Flesch-Kincaid formula. According to the Gunning-Fog metric, readers would have to attend school until the 11th grade. The presented study demonstrates the feasibility of a fully automated text processing tool-chain for patient information booklets. The results reveal that readability metrics should be carefully interpreted and only be interchanged with caution.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the use of an experimental smart diaper as an indicator of saturation for diaper change in persons with dementia living in nursing homes.A multicenter prospective study was conducted in 3 nursing homes amongst 18 residents with dementia. For each resident, a frequency-volume urine chart (FVUC) was kept for 24 h including voided volume and diaper weights, wearing smart diapers. A comparative study was set up between results obtained by smart diapers and data registered in FVUCs.Analysis based on quantification of the agreement between saturation calculated by smart diaper and determined by FVUC indicates that measurements reported by sensor do not correspond with measurements based on FVUC. For the regular diaper, the saturation measured by sensor may be 26% below or 39% above saturation based on FVUC and for the super diaper, respectively, 34% below or 30% above.This study indicates that the sensor detects and notifies wetness but is not sensitive enough for using it as an indicator for diaper change in people with severe dementia.

This study analyses the responsiveness of outpatient care to assess the quality of urban primary health care among all 5 types of health care providers in Bangladesh, namely, the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project, the NGO Health Services Delivery Project (NHSDP), NGOs, private hospitals, and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). Other than some public-private comparisons, there is an absolute knowledge gap regarding responsiveness in urban health systems, particularly in the context of Bangladesh, and this gap motivates this study. The study used primary data collected from 810 randomly selected outpatients. The survey used a structured questionnaire on all 7 domains of responsiveness of outpatient care suggested by the World Health Organization. The estimated mean responsiveness score reveals that overall, approximately 33% of the patients rated the responsiveness of the system as poor. In reported responsiveness, the NHSDP was ranked at the top and the MOHFW at the bottom. The latter is quite expected. Overall, prompt attention and autonomy were the worst-performing domains, and choice of provider, dignity, and clear communication were the better-performing ones. The results suggest the need to improve the degree of responsiveness of all domains, especially those that are more concerned with access to health care, namely, prompt attention, dignity, clear communication, and confidentiality. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare facilities should give additional consideration to promote prompt attention, autonomy, and quality of basic amenities. Private facilities should also provide additional stress on improving prompt attention and autonomy. The nontherapeutic quality of health care needs to be emphasized in the medical education system. Further research based on household surveys could be worthwhile to measure responsiveness more comprehensively.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Atherosclerosis is widely known to be a chronic inflammatory disease. C-reactive protein (CRP), an important inflammatory factor, plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Nicotine, the main addictive component of cigarette, has been shown to induce the production of CRP. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rosmarinic acid (RA), a polyphenol with antiinflammatory activity, on nicotine-induced elevation of CRP in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We found that pretreatment of VSMCs with RA attenuated nicotine-induced expression of CRP in a time- and dose-dependant manner. In addition, RA also inhibited the activation of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production resulting from nicotine treatment in VSMCs. To confirm these findings in vivo, we constructed a nicotine-induced atherosclerosis rat model. RA did not significantly reduce the serum nicotine level of the rats, whereas it significantly decreased the levels of serum lipids, including concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the serum level of CRP. RA also led to diminished nicotine-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and elevation in the CRP level in the aortic tissue of the model rats. The results of this study suggested a protective role of RA in nicotine-induced atherosclerosis by inhibiting the ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome-CRP axial, and RA therefore represented a potential effective therapeutic approach to atherosclerosis, in particular for those who smoke.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Previous studies have reported an additive effect of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (ST) on depressive symptoms. However, no studies have been conducted in rural community settings. This cross-sectional study investigated whether the additive effect of MVPA and ST was associated with depressive symptoms in rural Japanese adults.We identified 2,814 participants from health examinations conducted in Shimane, rural Japan, in 2012 and analyzed data from 1,958 participants. We assessed depressive symptoms using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and measured the total time spent on MVPA and ST using a Japanese short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Poisson regression analysis examined the prevalence ratios (PR) of depressive symptoms in nine category combinations of MVPA level (no, insufficient, or sufficient MVPA) and ST level (high, moderate, or low ST).A total of 117 (6.0%) participants had depressive symptoms. Compared with the reference category (no MVPA/high ST), multivariate analysis showed that the likelihood of depressive symptoms was significantly lower in the sufficient MVPA/low ST category (PR 0.23; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.08-0.66), insufficient MVPA/low ST category (PR 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.86), and insufficient MVPA/moderate ST category (PR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17-0.90).Analysis of the additive effect of MVPA and ST showed that the combinational category of sufficient MVPA and low ST had the lowest prevalence of depressive symptoms in rural Japanese adults.

Mental disorders often emerge in adolescence and young adulthood, and these disorders can have lasting effects on students' health, social functioning, and education. Although evidence-based treatments have been established for many mental disorders, few community therapists use such treatments. What is needed is a practical, economically feasible means of training clinicians to implement evidence-based treatments suitable for widespread use. This cluster randomized trial will randomize 26 college counseling centers to one of two implementation strategies for training counselors to use interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), an evidence-based treatment for depression and eating disorders: 1) an external expert consultation model comprising a workshop, therapy manual, and expert follow-up consultation (n = 13); or 2) a train-the-trainer model in which a staff member from the counseling center is coached to train other staff members to implement IPT (n = 13). The primary outcome is therapist adherence to IPT, with secondary outcomes of therapist competence in IPT and client outcomes for depression and eating disorders. Therapist and organizational characteristics will be explored as potential moderators and mediators of implementation outcomes. Implementation costs for each of the training methods will also be assessed. The present study involves partnering with college counseling centers to determine the most effective method to implement IPT for depression and eating disorders in these settings.

The operating room is a high pressure environment for surgical trainees as they attempt to reach a high level of performance in the midst of a multitude of stressors. The purpose of this work was to examine the relationships between stress, coping, and psychological resilience and their effects on performance and learning in surgical training.A narrative review was carried out of the existing literature on stress, coping, and resilience in surgeons and surgical trainees. Multiple fields of study were examined including medical education, surgery, surgical safety, anesthesia, workplace ergonomics, and psychology.Sources of intraoperative stress include fatigue, disruptions, interpersonal conflicts, time pressure, a complex case or high risk patient, surgical errors, and surgeon temperament. These stressors can negatively impact the performance of surgeons and trainees and may inhibit learning. How a learner responds to stress in the operating room is highly variable and influenced by the context of the stress, the coping mechanisms available, and individual psychological resilience. Stress management techniques, such as mental rehearsal, are beneficial for reducing stress. Resilience is protective against stress and burnout, and resilience training is useful for reducing stress and improving mental health in physicians and medical students.Surgical trainees experience significant stress in the operating room and their experience of stress is modulated by cognitive and behavioral factors. Further research is required on the development of effective interventions to help trainees manage intraoperative stress, with the potential to improve surgical performance, learning, and patient safety.Copyright © 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

To investigate school policies and practices related to drinking fluids and toileting and test their association with children's hydration status and toilet behaviors.Cross-sectional study in 2014.Seventeen Belgian primary schools.A total of 416 children (aged 7-13 years).Hydration was measured by urinary osmolality in a pooled school-day sample and by impedance-based body water percentage. Children reported how much they liked school toilets. School policy and practices were reported by schools on 59 items over 10 policy components.Multilevel logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, region and socioeconomic status.School's weaknesses were the lack of policy participation by parents and children; official agreements (only in 11%); organizing education on drinking and toilet visits; and toilet infrastructure. Children's hydration was higher in schools that (1) made water available, (2) organized toilet and drinking related education, (3) had formal agreements on drinking and toilet visits, and (4) had good toilet maintenance. Children liked school toilets more in schools that (1) organized toilet and drinking related education, (2) had an official policy on drinking, (3) had good toilet infrastructure, and (4) allowed policy participation by parents and children.Specific action points for school management and government to improve children's hydration at school were detected by focusing on both drinking and toilet practices/infrastructure.Copyright © 2018 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.

Enrichment of school counselors' knowledge would be an effective way to promote sexual and reproductive health (SRH) among adolescents. The present study aims to assess the effect of educational intervention on knowledge and self-efficacy of high school counselors on teenage SRH.A randomized controlled trial was conducted between June 2016 and March 2017. One hundred and twelve high school counselors from Tehran were recruited and randomized into two groups. The intervention was comprised of training courses on adolescent SRH as per two educational approaches: the team-based learning (TBL) and lecturing, which consisted of four sessions of 2 hours in 2 weeks. The knowledge and feeling of self-efficacy in both groups were assessed at the beginning of the study and 8 weeks after the intervention by researcher-made questionnaires.After intervention, the mean and standard deviation of the knowledge and self-efficacy scores increased significantly in both TBL and lecture groups (p < .001). However, the final mean (standard deviation) of counselors' knowledge and self-efficacy scores in the TBL group were significantly higher than that of those in the lecture group [20.06 (2.74) vs. 18.90 (2.95); p = .03 for knowledge and 43.01 (4.08) versus 41.15 (4.99); p = .03 for self-efficacy] with an almost moderate effect size d = .55 for both outcomes.The better SRH knowledge and self-efficacy in TBL group can be indicative of the group's effect on making challenges, especially in subjects that are socio-religious by nature. It seems that applying learner-centered educational approaches such as TBL can facilitate achieving pre-assigned SRH goals.Copyright © 2018 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Although there is a strong and consistent association between social support and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the directionality of this association has been debated, with some research indicating that social support protects against PTSD symptoms, whereas other research suggests that PTSD symptoms erode social support. The majority of studies in the literature have been cross-sectional, rendering directionality impossible to determine. Cross-lagged panel models overcome many previous limitations; however, findings from the few studies employing these designs have been mixed, possibly due to methodological differences including self-report versus clinician-administered assessment. The current study used a cross-lagged panel structural equation model to explore the relationship between social support and chronic PTSD symptoms over a 1-year period in a sample of 264 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans assessed several years after trauma exposure. Approximately a third of the sample met criteria for PTSD at the baseline assessment, with veterans' trauma occurring an average of 6 years prior to baseline. Two separate models were run, with one using PTSD symptoms assessed via self-report and the other using clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms. Excellent model fit was found for both models. Results indicated that the relationship between social support and PTSD symptoms was affected by assessment modality. Whereas the self-report model indicated a bidirectional relationship between social support and PTSD symptoms over time, the clinician-assessed model indicated only that baseline PTSD symptoms predicted social support 1 year later. Results highlight that assessment modality is one factor that likely impacts disparate findings across previous studies. Theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed, with suggestions for the growing body of literature utilizing these designs to dismantle this complex association.Copyright © 2018.

Child maltreatment is a complex and multifaceted construct in need of advanced statistical techniques to improve its measurement. The current study compared the predictive utility of a cumulative index to a factor analytic approach for constructing a measure of maltreatment. Data were from Waves III and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Wave III: n = 14,800; Wave IV: n = 12,288). As adults, participants retrospectively reported on their childhood experiences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, supervisory neglect, and social services investigations. Both the cumulative index and a two-factor solution showed evidence of convergent validity, predicting lifetime incidence of homelessness, being paid for sex, and various measures of running away or living apart from biological parents, and prospectively predicting depression, substance use, and criminal behavior. The latent variables, derived from a factor analytic approach, had greater explanatory power for many outcomes compared to the cumulative index, even when controlling for sociodemographic variables. Results suggest that factor analysis is a better methodology than a cumulative index for measuring maltreatment in large datasets when explanatory power for external outcomes is of greatest concern.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study examined factors associated with the preference for patient-provider ethnic concordance in Asian Americans.With data drawn from the 2015 Asian American Quality of Life Survey (N = 2535), a logistic regression model of the preference for patient-provider ethnic concordance was tested with demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education), health and access (chronic medical conditions, self-rated health, health insurance coverage), immigration-related (place of birth, length of stay in the US, English proficiency, acculturation), and adverse experience (perceived discrimination, communication problems in healthcare settings) variables.Over half (52.4%) of those in the sample preferred to be treated by a healthcare provider from their own ethnic background. In a multivariate model, the odds for preferring ethnic concordance were 1.52-1.64 times higher among individuals in earlier stages of immigration, language acquisition, and acculturation. Individuals who had experienced communication problems in healthcare settings presented 3.74 times higher odds for preferring ethnic concordance than did counterparts without such experience.The results emphasized the value of paying attention to patient-provider concordance when treating Asian Americans either relatively new to the country or who have had previous problems communicating with health professionals. The findings also provide implications for improving workforce diversity in healthcare delivery and medical education.

Stress has been suggested as a contributing factor in the etiology of Parkinson's Disease (PD), but epidemiological evidence is sparse.The objective of this study was to explore the association between occupational stress according to the job demands-control model and the risk for PD.We conducted a population-based cohort study with 2,544,748 Swedes born 1920 to 1950 who had an occupation reported in the population and housing censuses in 1980 or, if missing, in 1970. Job demands and control were measured using a job-exposure matrix. Incident PD cases were identified using Swedish national health registers from 1987 to 2010. Data were analyzed with Cox regression with age as the underlying time scale, adjusting for sex, education, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a proxy for smoking.During a mean follow-up time of 21.3 years, 21,544 incident PD cases were identified. High demands were associated with increased PD risk among men, most evident in men with high education. High control was associated with increased PD risk among the low educated. This association was more pronounced in women. High-strain jobs (high demands and low control) was only associated with increased PDrisk among men with high education, whereas active jobs (high demands and high control) were associated with increased PD risk among men with low education.High job demands appear to increase PD risk in men, especially in men with high education, whereas high job control increases PD risk among low educated, more strongly in women. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.© 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

Medical students often become involved as post-disaster emergency responders despite incomplete training, and in doing so may suppress their immediate experiences as victims and survivors. This experience, however, may lead them to increase their motivation to help others. We examined how cognitive and emotional reactions to disaster correlated with posttraumatic growth (PTG) in medical students in Fukushima, Japan after the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011. To date, Fukushima continues to suffer from radiation concerns following the nuclear power plant meltdown. In a survey three years after the onset of a long-term disaster, with a cross-sectional research design, medical students (N = 494) reported their negative post-disaster reactions, desire to help, and demonstrations of capability, and completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). We conducted hierarchical regression analyses and found that the addition of variables pertaining to negative post-disaster reactions (e.g. confusion, anger, and sadness) led to the largest increase in predictive value for PTGI scores; students reporting a past traumatic experience were also more likely to experience PTG. Our results indicate that weathering stressful disaster circumstances created opportunities for positive personal growth and reinforcement at a crucial time in medical students' professional development.

A national survey of medical oncologists. End-of-life discussions (EOLd) including the option of forgoing anticancer treatment infrequently occur until treatment options have been exhausted for advanced cancer patients. We aimed to identify oncologist-related factors contributing to the timing of discussing the option of forgoing anticancer treatment.In this nationwide survey of 864 medical oncologists, we asked about physicians' attitudes toward the timing of discussing the option of forgoing anticancer treatment for a simulated patient with newly diagnosed metastatic cancer, physicians' experience of EOLd, perceptions of a good death, and beliefs. Multivariate analyses identified determinants of early discussions.Among 490 physicians (response rate = 57%), 167 (35%) would discuss the option of forgoing anticancer treatment \"now (at the diagnosis).\" Physicians' attitudes toward discussing the option \"now\" were significantly correlated with a greater physician-perceived importance of life completion (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.00-1.69, p = 0.048) and dying in a preferred place (OR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.01-1.65, p = 0.045) for a good death, and not perceiving EOLd as being severely distressing for patients/families (OR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.54-0.95, p = 0.021). In multivariate analyses, independent determinants of the attitude toward discussing the option now included a greater physician-perceived importance of life completion for a good death (OR = 1.38, 95%CI = 1.05-1.81, p = 0.019), and not perceiving EOLd as being severely distressing for patients/families (OR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.52-0.94, p = 0.017).Reflection by oncologists on their own perception regarding a good death and beliefs about EOLd may help oncologists individualize the timing of discussing the option of forgoing anticancer treatment.

Physical activity was measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) at baseline and after 12 weeks. The association between physical activity and other clinical characteristics was analyzed.At baseline, physical activity amount was 2315.5 ± 3513.2 MET min/week: 33.0% inactive, 49.6% minimally active, and 17.4% health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) active. Factors associated with HEPA include cancer stage and grip strength. A significantly lower proportion was HEPA active among those with advanced stage than among those with stage 0. After intervention, physical activity was increased to 3466.2 ± 4712.5 MET min/week: 15.3% inactive, 50.4% minimally active, and 34.2% HEPA active. Physical activity was increased in 63.4% of the participants. Factors associated with physical activity increase include cancer stage, diarrhea, and type of exercise intervention.

Background Return to work with or after a chronic disease is not a very well understood process, influenced by a variety of personal, professional, societal and medical factors. The aim of this study is to identify predictors for return to work 12 months after a solid organ transplant applying a bio-psycho-social model. Methods This study is based on patients included in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study, a national prospective multicentre cohort, who underwent a first solid organ transplant (kidney, liver, heart, lung). Bio-psycho-social factors were tested and predictors of return to work identified using logistic regression models. Results Among the 636 patients included in the study, 49.8% (317) were employed 12 months post-transplant. The major predictor for returning to work 12 months posttransplant was pre-transplant employment status (OR 10.8). Accordingly, the population was stratified in employed and not employed pre-transplant groups. Age, self-perceived health (6 months post-transplant) and the transplanted organ were significantly associated with post-transplant employment status in both groups. Return to work was influenced by education, depression (6 month post-transplant) and waiting time in the employed pre-transplant group and by invalidity pension in the not employed pre-transplant group. Conclusion Employment status pre-transplant being highly associated with employment status post-transplant, the process promoting return to work should be started well before surgery. Biomedical, psychological and social factors must be taken into account to promote return to work in transplanted patients.

Females (52%) of the medical institute suffered from mild to moderately-severe depression in contrast to the males (33%). Females were found to be affected by mild anxiety and phobia (42.7 and 26% respectively) exceeding the male population (27.3 and 15.3% respectively). However, severe depression or anxiety was not observed in either gender groups significantly, suggesting a healthy mental picture of these medical students.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sitagliptin on glucose tolerance, plasma lipids, energy expenditure and metabolism of brown adipose tissue (BAT), white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle in overweight individuals with prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose).We performed a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 30 overweight, Europid men (age 45.9 ± 6.2 years; BMI 28.8 ± 2.3 kg/m2) with prediabetes in the Leiden University Medical Center and the Alrijne Hospital between March 2015 and September 2016. Participants were initially randomly allocated to receive sitagliptin (100 mg/day) (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) for 12 weeks, using a randomisation list that was set up by an unblinded pharmacist. All people involved in the study as well as participants were blinded to group assignment. Two participants withdrew from the study prior to completion (both in the sitagliptin group) and were subsequently replaced with two new participants that were allocated to the same treatment. Before and after treatment, fasting venous blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained, OGTT was performed and body composition, resting energy expenditure and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) uptake by metabolic tissues were assessed. The primary study endpoint was the effect of sitagliptin on BAT volume and activity.One participant from the sitagliptin group was excluded from analysis, due to a distribution error, leaving 29 participants for further analysis. Sitagliptin, but not placebo, lowered glucose excursion (-40%; p < 0.003) during OGTT, accompanied by an improved insulinogenic index (+38%; p < 0.003) and oral disposition index (+44%; p < 0.003). In addition, sitagliptin lowered serum concentrations of triacylglycerol (-29%) and very large (-46%), large (-35%) and medium-sized (-24%) VLDL particles (all p < 0.05). Body weight, body composition and energy expenditure did not change. In skeletal muscle, sitagliptin increased mRNA expression of PGC1β (also known as PPARGC1B) (+117%; p < 0.05), a main controller of mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism. Although the primary endpoint of change in BAT volume and activity was not met, sitagliptin increased [18F] FDG uptake in subcutaneous WAT (sWAT; +53%; p < 0.05). Reported side effects were mild and transient and not necessarily related to the treatment.Twelve weeks of sitagliptin in overweight, Europid men with prediabetes improves glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism, as related to increased [18F] FDG uptake by sWAT, rather than BAT, and upregulation of the mitochondrial gene PGC1β in skeletal muscle. Studies on the effect of sitagliptin on preventing or delaying the progression of prediabetes into type 2 diabetes are warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02294084.This study was funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, Dutch Heart Foundation, Dutch Diabetes Research Foundation, Ministry of Economic Affairs and the University of Granada.

The study protocol included a clinical and radiological examination, the completion of the SRS-24 questionnaire and acquisition of data on socio-economic factors (educational and employment status) and physical activity. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data; differences between patients with mild (< 30°) and severe curves (30°-50°) regarding hrQoL outcomes were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U Test.Primary outcomes showed full employment (higher education, 39%, and full-time work, 61%) and the majority of the patients (79.9%) performing moderate sports two to four times per week. The SRS-24 questionnaire produced a total mean score (MS) of 4.0 (79.9%). Patients with mild curves had a significantly better total score (MS 4.1 vs. MS 3.8, p = 0.020) and were more satisfied with the treatment (MS 4.3 vs MS 3.9, p = 0.020). As to the secondary outcomes, from start of bracing to follow-up (a mean of 6.7 years after brace weaning), the average Cobb angle changed from 28.6° to 25.6° (range 4°-48°); in 51.2% the curve angles could be maintained after weaning.Compared with the literature, our results showed similar curve development and hrQoL (pain, self-image and function) and better results regarding satisfaction with treatment.

Palliative Care (PC) is an evolving oncology subspecialty in the Middle East (ME). Justified opioid use is an integral part of palliative care. Often, morphine consumption is taken as a quality indicator of palliative care services, but is it a reliable indicator to reflect the status of palliative care in current Middle East setting? We need to understand that data on morphine consumption, represent the amount distributed of morphine per person in a country and does not refer the actual justified amount utilization of opioids. In addition, the currently used consumption data is not reflective of product and dosage employed. It includes opioid use in other conditions like post-operative pain, traumatic pain, and drug abuse as well. The population and cancer incidence is highly variable amongst countries. The opioid consumption reported at present in Oman is very low 0.5474 mg/person. The opioid prescription must have an appropriate validated policy, well administered and enforced effectively. The policy must be balanced in such a way to eliminate the barriers of availability on one hand, and limit the probability of abuse on the other. Ideally there should be a national empowered competent control authority which should estimate the needs, license, distribute, monitor and report opioid use. There is an additional need to train health care workers in adequate pain assessment, effective pain management, and validated opioid prescribing practices. The issues in the Middle Eastern (ME) countries are erratic and undependable cancer data, limited palliative care programs, non-effective or no palliative care/pain management policies, and almost non-existent prescription policies of controlled drugs. There is an urgent and essential need to work for comprehensive and integrated palliative care programs encompassing the subspecialties. It must include and care for local perspectives of psychological, social, spiritual, and religious issues in PC in addition to pain management.

Internet Addiction (IA) among medical students and its association with psychological distress can impact their academic progress and long term career goals. IA would also indirectly impact community of health care professionals and the society. Thus, there is a need to investigate the IA among medical students.This study was a first such attempt to explore internet use behavior's, IA, among a large group of medical students across multiple centers and its association with psychological distress primarily depression.1763 medical students aged 18 to 21 years, pursuing Bachelor of Medicine; Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) from three south Indian cities of Bangalore, Mangalore and Trissur participated in the study. The socio-educational and internet use behaviors data sheet was used to gather demographic information and patterns of internet use, IA Test (IAT) was utilized to assess IA and Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20) assessed psychological distress primarily depression.Among the total N = 1763, 27% of medical students met criterion for mild addictive internet use, 10.4% for moderate addictive internet use, and 0.8% for severe addiction to internet. IA was higher among medical students who were male, staying in rented accommodations, accessed internet several times a day, spent more than 3 h per day on internet and had psychological distress. Age, gender, duration of use, time spent per day, frequency of internet use and psychological distress (depression) predicted IA.A substantial proportion of medical students have IA which can be detrimental for their medical education progress and long term career goals. Early identification and management of IA and psychological distress among medical students is crucial.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Studies in peer learning and teaching reported in the nursing literature are mainly descriptive, summarising positive aspects using survey and interviews. Application of pedagogical approaches to near-peer teaching in undergraduate nursing, using educational psychology frameworks to explain the outcomes, is relatively unknown.The objective of this integrative review was to ascertain outcomes of near-peer teaching in undergraduate nurse education and theoretical frameworks used to explain outcomes of near-peer teaching.Included qualitative and quantitative studies.The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA protocol and Joanna Briggs Institute processes and included studies published between the years 1990 and 2017. Quality appraisal involved two independent reviewers analysing the data, and narrative synthesis was used to report results.Two hundred and twenty-one abstracts were assessed independently by two reviewers for relevance to near-peer teaching in undergraduate nurse education, 29 articles selected for further review with 10 meeting the inclusion criteria. Benefits of near-peer teaching were reported as creating a safe supportive learning environment, learners viewing near-peer teachers as effective role models and increased confidence experienced by learner and teacher. Studies focused mainly on cognition in relation to performance with little emphasis on metacognition or affective behaviours, highlighting the need for more studies to provide definitive evidence supporting this pedagogical approach and framing its implementation around theories, particularly from educational psychology.Lack of training provided to near-peer teachers highlighted that it is imperative that faculty embed near-peer teaching into the curriculum. To develop this educational intervention, studies in near-peer teaching are required to assess affective behaviours and metacognitive qualities of near-peer teachers to determine how this educational intervention can impact learning and performance of both the learner and near-peer teacher.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Quick and accurate triage of patients in the emergency department is a key factor for successful management of the emergency situations and ensuring the quality of care. Moreover, triage skills education is one of the important aspects of preparedness of nurses for different emergency situations. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of educating emergency severity index (ESI) triage using lecture and role-playing on the knowledge and practice of nursing students.This experimental study was conducted in the School of Nursing and Midwifery, Tabriz, Iran, in 2016. In this study, 56 nursing students were selected by convenience sampling method and were randomly divided into two groups. Triage scenarios were taught and presented in two ways by using lecture or role-playing method. One month later, the post-test was taken. Data were collected using a questionnaire assessing the knowledge and practice of ESI and were analysed using SPSS (version 21).The mean knowledge and practice scores in both groups improved significantly (p < 0.05). The post-test score showed a significant difference between the two groups, and the mean score was higher in the role-playing group compared with that of the lecture group (p < 0.05).The results showed the effectiveness of both educational methods on students' learning. However, the role-playing method was more effective than the lecture method and is recommended for triage education. In addition, according to the importance of triage, developing the theoretical and practical education courses for nursing students is recommended.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was to investigate the differences in the types, frequency, and perspectives of self-reported adverse events reported following simulation encounters between students enrolled in two Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) programs: accelerated option (AO-BSN) or traditional (T-BSN) and by role (participant or observer) during simulation.This study analyzed 6994 adverse event reports entered by students through the simulated adverse event reporting system.The AO-BSN students reported a higher percentage of adverse events coded as errors. In contrast the T-BSN students reported more near misses and sentinel events. Further, the T-BSN students significantly reported more fall related errors, while AO-BSN students reported more confidentiality breach errors. Participants reported more medication errors, whereas observers reported more airway and fall categorized errors.The vantage from which adverse events are viewed and educational track appear to alter slightly the perceptions of the precipitating factors leading to committed or observed adverse events.Copyright © 2018.

The decentralized bioreactor is a promising process for landfill leachate (LL) treatment, however, it is often confronted with various forms of shock loadings. To explore the robustness of bioreactors to the long-lasting substrate shocks, a long-term study of over 90 days was carried out to investigate the effects of nitrogen (mainly ammonium nitrogen, NH4-N) and organic (in terms of chemical oxygen demand, COD) shock loading on an engineered zeolite-based biofilter with alternative soil-mixed block (SMB) (EZS-biofilter) for treating matured LL. The low-, mid-, and high-strength intensity of matured LL was theoretical defined mainly according to the content of total nitrogen (TN) and COD. The experiment proved that the EZS-biofilter could effectively absorb the substrate shocks in a range of 104, 408, and 1357 mg/L as TN and 178, 590, and 1050 mg/L as COD, corresponding to the low-, medium-, and high-strength LL, respectively. A modified sensitivity index reflected that the nitrogen shock loadings exerted much more predominant influence than COD shock due to the great variation of nitrification/denitrification. The provided information in this study are beneficial for the practical engineered operation of biofilters for treating matured LL.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Body-related pride has been associated with health behaviors such as physical activity; however, researchers have overlooked distinctions between different domains of pride (appearance/fitness) and the two facets of pride (authentic/hubristic). The objective of the present research was to examine relationships between fitness- and appearance-related authentic and hubristic pride and physical activity. In Study 1, participants (N = 115) completed measures of fitness-related pride and participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Both authentic and hubristic pride were positively associated with MVPA. In Study 2, participants (N = 173) completed measures of appearance-related pride and MVPA. Neither facet of pride predicted engagement in MVPA. In Study 3, participants (N = 401) completed measures of both fitness-related pride and appearance-related pride as well as MVPA. Authentic and hubristic fitness-related pride were associated with MVPA, while appearance-related hubristic pride was negatively associated with MVPA. Results support the adaptive nature of pride in motivating engagement in health behaviors when it is experienced around the body's functionality rather than appearance.Copyright © 2018.

Psychosocial difficulties are known to greatly impact the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of a child with epilepsy, and parental coping is a unique aspect that has not been examined in relation to HRQOL in the pediatric population with epilepsy. This study assessed the relationship of parental coping with HRQOL and other clinical and sociodemographic factors.Data included parental ratings on the Illness Cognition Questionnaire-Parent (ICQ-P) and the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE) questionnaire for 108 children and adolescents with epilepsy (mean 11.34 years of age). The ICQ-P examines parental coping through constructs of illness cognitions while QOLCE determines overall functioning as indicated by parents. Bivariate correlations were conducted to identify significant associations with parental coping, followed by a multiple linear regression to determine the relative contribution of parental coping on HRQOL. Sociodemographic factors on parental coping were explored with an analysis of covariance.Longer duration of epilepsy (r = 0.202) and higher HRQOL (r = 0.208) were significantly associated with parental acceptance on the ICQ-P. Higher parental helplessness was significantly associated with female gender of the child (r = 0.262), diminished HRQOL (r = -0.566), greater seizure frequency (r = 0.255), and higher number of prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (r = 0.226). Parent-rated perceived benefits did not have significant association with study variables. Multiple linear regression revealed age of seizure onset (β = 0.19, p = 0.05), seizure frequency (β = -0.22, p = 0.01), and degree of parental helplessness (β = -0.50, p ≤ 0.01) as unique predictors of HRQOL. Two separate ANCOVAs revealed no significant associations between maternal education or insurance type on parental helplessness.Parental coping is significantly related to HRQOL in youth with epilepsy, and elevated feelings of helplessness, along with epilepsy severity, predict lower HRQOL. These findings are the first to demonstrate the unique role of parental coping in HRQOL among youth with epilepsy, and they highlight the importance of providing support to the whole family during pediatric epilepsy treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence from the Young Finns Study using Mendelian randomization. Using participants (N = 1733) drawn from the nationally representative longitudinal Young Finns Study (YFS) we estimate the effect of education on depressive symptoms. In 2007, when the participants were between 30 and 45 years old, they reported their depressive symptoms using a revised version of Beck's Depression Inventory. Education was measured using register information on the highest completed level of education in 2007, which was converted to years of education. To identify a causal relationship between education and depressive symptoms we use an instrumental variables approach (Mendelian randomization, MR) with a genetic risk score as an instrument for years of education. The genetic risk score was based on 74 genetic variants, which were associated with years of education in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Because the genetic variants are randomly assigned at conception, they induce exogenous variation in years of education and thus identify a causal effect if the assumptions of the MR approach are met. In Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation years of education in 2007 were negatively associated with depressive symptoms in 2007 (b = -0.027, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = -0.040, -0.015). However, the results based on Mendelian randomization suggested that the effect is not causal (b = 0.017; 95% CI = -0.144, 0.178). This indicates that omitted variables correlated with education and depression may bias the linear regression coefficients and exogenous variation in education caused by differences in genetic make-up does not seem to protect against depressive symptoms.Copyright © 2018.

Organised mammography screening programmes may reduce socioeconomic inequalities in breast cancer screening, but evidence is contradictory. Switzerland has no national organised mammography screening programme, but regional programmes were progressively introduced since 1999, giving the opportunity to conduct a nationwide quasi-experimental study. We examined the evolution of socioeconomic inequalities in mammography screening in Switzerland and if exposure to regional organised programmes reduced socioeconomic inequalities. Data of 10,927 women aged 50 to 70 years old were collected from the Swiss Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey repeated 5 times (1992-2012). Socioeconomic characteristics were assessed using education, income, employment status, and occupational class. Adjusted prevalence ratios of up-to-date mammography screening were estimated with Poisson regressions and weighted for sampling strategy and non-participation bias. In the absence of organised screening programmes (1992-1997), prevalence of mammography screening increased by 23% and was associated with tertiary education and working part time. During the period of progressive introduction of regionally organised programmes (2002-2012), prevalence of mammography screening increased by 19% every 5 years and was associated with exposure to regional programmes and with independent/artisan occupations. Tertiary education and working part time were no longer associated. Exposure to organised programmes did not modify socioeconomic inequalities except for employment status: not employed women benefitted more from organised programmes compared to women working full time. In conclusion, socioeconomic inequalities in mammography screening decreased over time but organised programmes did not greatly modify them, except women not employed whose prevalence passed employed women.Copyright © 2018.
