Drawn from a broader research project concernedwith the\\u2018e turn\\u2019in school health and physical education, thispaper analyses three examples of digital food education (DEF).This is done by considering the role of digital technology inchanging\\u2013or not changing\\u2013earlier forms of food education. Ineach case, these processes are viewed as portals of connectionthrough which knowledge claims are produced, copied, merged,manipulated, juxtaposed and re-represented.

Education domain becomes highly technology enabled in recent past and this strategy is rising out and as a result, various concepts, areas, and domains have been created viz. Education Technology, E-Learning, Online Education, Blended Learning and as a whole this concept and this area may be called as a Digital Education\\/ Digital Learning. Internationally many universities have started educational programs leading to Bachelors and Masters Degree in respect of Digital Education and its subfields (mentioned above). The awards are offered in different subjects and are tagged with concentration and major in this area. The Digital Education becomes an important area of research as well due to its importance, many universities have started research program leading to PhD and other professional doctorate degrees. This study is concentrated on Masters degrees in the field of Digital Education and Digital Learning which are available internationally, based on selected research methodologies. This paper emphasizes the role, growth and values of Digital Education and Learning including future growth and stakeholders in this field.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Digital Education; E-Learning; Higher Education; Digitalization; MSc (Digital Education); International Universities; Professional Degrees\",\"subject\":\"Digital Education; E-Learning; Higher Education; Digitalization; MSc (Digital Education); International Universities; Professional Degrees\",\"authors\":\"P.

In this article, the authors propose a conceptual framework for exploring digital inclusion in higher education that attempts to broaden the way in which it is understood. The conceptual framework encompasses two strands: one that focuses on technology, personal and contextual factors, and one that focuses on resources and choices. This framework will be used to present and discuss the results of a study which aimed to explore the e-learning experiences of disabled students at one higher education institution. The discussion will focus particularly on concepts of digital agility and digital decision-making, and will consider the potential implications for the empowerment of disabled students.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2010\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"agility digital; conceptualising digital; context disabled\",\"authors\":\"Seale, Jane; Draffan, E.A.; Wald, Mike\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.soton.ac.uk\\/71809\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"0526533f14f3af97c71d809791195c453141782efc037245ec56295d92dec108\",\"relevance\":99,\"lang_detected\":\"english\",\"cluster_labels\":\"Higher education institutions, Digital inclusion, Higher education students\",\"x\":\"-0.13240233339121\",\"y\":\"0.124595505005699\",\"area_uri\":5,\"area\":\"Higher education institutions, Digital inclusion, Higher education students\"}]"
