While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 55-72 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley<U+2019>s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes<U+2019>s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism. The issue at stake is how exemplary crime fictions make sense of, and critically interrogate, the relationship between race, violence and neoliberalism.\",\"published_in\":\"Pepper , A 2019 , ' Race, violence and neoliberalism: crime fiction in the era of Ferguson and Black Lives Matter ' , Textual Practice , vol. 33 , no. 6 , pp. 963-982 . https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/0950236X.2017.1365755\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Race; violence; neoliberalism; crime fiction; The Wire; Ferguson; Black Lives Matter\",\"subject\":\"Race; violence; neoliberalism; crime fiction; The Wire; Ferguson; Black Lives Matter\",\"authors\":\"Pepper, Andrew\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/pure.qub.ac.uk\\/en\\/publications\\/race-violence-and-neoliberalism-crime-fiction-in-the-era-of-ferguson-and-black-lives-matter(9bc7c63d-3cb7-4d26-867c-d655587e4033).html\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"2c9ededff77e84ed3a7b9a6653aaab1ac400a0a1798a6927ac119158f039597b\",\"relevance\":103},{\"id\":\"4b31f814936d4ff57ef5f42ab7cabae350ef1ebc9138f8233880a1753573ccda\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18704; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p85\",\"title\":\"A call to healing: Black Lives Matter movement as a framework for addressing the health and wellness of Black women\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement re-centered and illuminated the disparities facing the Black population as a result of systemic racism in the United States (U.S.).

Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life<U+2014>the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment<U+2014>is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles<U+2014>liberation, inspiration, and healing<U+2014>to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life. Appealing to the Smithsonian<U+2019>s National Museum of African American History and Culture as an example, this paper articulates the possibilities of architectural projects to symbolically and practically support liberative goals in African American religious systems and political movements.\",\"published_in\":\"Religions, Vol 8, Iss 12, p 256 (2017)\",\"year\":\"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"African American religion; African American spirituality; Black Lives Matter; architecture; built environment; womanist ethics; ecowomanism; liberation theology; social justice; National Museum of African American History and Culture; Religions.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 55-72 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Racism; Empowerment; Resilience; Black Lives Matter; Philosophy.

From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change.

Examining punishment discourses intersectionally unearths profound, unequal distinctions when controlling for the variety of victims<U+2019> identities within the punishment regime. For example, trans women of color are likely to face the harshest of realties when confronted with the prospect of punishment. However, missing from much of the academic carceral literature is a critical perspective situated in racialized epistemic frameworks. If racialized individuals are more likely to be affected by punishment systems, then, certainly, they are the foremost experts on what those realities are like. The Black Lives Matter hashtag came about during the aftermath of the George Zimmerman non-verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and it helped to cultivate the organization which turned into a multiracial international movement in defense of Black dignity and humanity. While Black Lives Matter was initially inspired by police violence, it has expanded its reach to include causes beyond police malpractice and brutality. This special issue of The Prison Journal seeks to merge principles associated with Black Lives Matter (as noted on their website) with critical issues endemic to community reentry after incarceration and the racialized and gendered impediments it produces. The empirical pieces included are qualitative to reflect the epistemologies of the affected, as we believe that narratives more powerfully capture these hard-to-reach (or deviant in comparison to the norm) perspectives. This special issue includes articles that critically foreground the voices of formerly incarcerated citizens (including some who are mothers and fathers) and reentry service providers. Importantly, it provides suggestions for new directions in reimagining a more democratic and racially equitable society without current punishment regimes. <\\/jats:p>\",\"published_in\":\"The Prison Journal ; volume 99, issue 4, page 387-395 ; ISSN 0032-8855 1552-7522\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"authors\":\"Williams, Jason M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0032885519852062\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"74b72e1d9a4950d23d453a8843b22093190bb2b0c1ab34a47a03dda9575e6048\",\"relevance\":91},{\"id\":\"6ae075d49e7055f800dcc269ecda57bbf09175e55b6283f519b5eedfa27f9c2f\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/topia.journals.yorku.ca\\/index.php\\/topia\\/article\\/view\\/40374\\/36474\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/topia.journals.yorku.ca\\/index.php\\/topia\\/article\\/view\\/40374\",\"title\":\"Blackening Canada Because Black Lives Matter\",\"paper_abstract\":\"A review of Barrett, Paul. 2015.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, <U+201C>Black lives matter!<U+201D> This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action. Note: UDP is a platform for voices to be heard. Therefore, this is a personal, self-reflection article for a specific population, and is not a reflection of the beliefs of UDP.\",\"published_in\":\"Understanding and Dismantling Privilege; Vol 7 No 1 (2017): UNDERSTANDING AND DISMANTLING PRIVILEGE; 53-65 ; 2152-1875\",\"year\":\"2017-04-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"subject\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"authors\":\"Harper, Matt\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\/article\\/view\\/16458\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1fd7689619b8b0b8d201792590461cacf4c354bbeb31bb1b1fab6da9f303cdef\",\"relevance\":86},{\"id\":\"14cd223e5283a195a1deee9b410b75288a51fba640c733ae1d3b7e9ba21d3a94\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18709; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p9\",\"title\":\"Hands up, don<U+2019>t shoot: A community psychology perspective on unarmed police shootings of Black people in America\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The killings of unarmed Black men and women in America at the hands of police officers are a prolific, pervasive, and unjust epidemic.

This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 9-21 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

The second key finding is that BLM organizations generated more tweets that framed the movement as a struggle for individual rights than ones that utilized frames about gender, racial, and LGBTQ identities. Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists urge their followers to pursue disruptive repertoires of contention less frequently than they encourage other political behaviors.

This theological base has created the frameworks that have dictated the sematic belief that Black bodies do not really matter and if they do, then they are invariably second-class ones when compared to White bodies.

In this paper, I am particularly interested in examining both the praxis of teaching African American literature as part of a cultural and civic literacy program for our students and then in examining the larger stakes of our moment, both for racism in the United States and the role of literature courses of programs.\",\"published_in\":\"The CEA Forum; Vol 45, No 2 (2016): Summer\\/Fall 2016; 26-53\",\"year\":\"2017-02-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"African American Literature; pedagogy; African American Literature; Black Lives Matter; pedagogy; curriculum\",\"subject\":\"African American Literature; pedagogy; African American Literature; Black Lives Matter; pedagogy; curriculum\",\"authors\":\"Gross, Jeffrey\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.tdl.org\\/ceaforum\\/index.php\\/ceaforum\\/article\\/view\\/7105\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"bd2e07a794728d9bea14c3c309f49465d3dd511f830831f1a63fa435769bbc9b\",\"relevance\":57},{\"id\":\"0566d0e55f65b5a1384737b06ecb0d94f480783cbc9e63c7de31668420edf2dd\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unisalento.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18704; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2421-2113; 2421-2113; doi:10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p85; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7b2de7ae5aa7474585ad4f21d77a43d5\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p85; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7b2de7ae5aa7474585ad4f21d77a43d5\",\"title\":\"A call to healing: Black Lives Matter movement as a framework for addressing the health and wellness of Black women\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement re-centered and illuminated the disparities facing the Black population as a result of systemic racism in the United States (U.S.). Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 85-100 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Black Lives Matter; Black women; anti-racism; mental health; social determinants of health; Philosophy.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group <U+2018>allies<U+2019>. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-10-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wilkins, D.J.; Livingstone, A.G.; Levine, M.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/131987\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"32938a80f4029cdcf71c763386d7e4839fda6eb77fe62058e9b530e0e96b7391\",\"relevance\":55},{\"id\":\"e50337a68a24b3069bfb277f497decb054212d911d7f24ffedcca5c6fed00975\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18707; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p73\",\"title\":\"#APIsforBlackLives: Unpacking the interracial discourse on the Asian American Pacific Islander and Black communities\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this paper we use the Ecological Metaphor to illustrate a complex and multilayered picture of the relationship between Black and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities, exploring how different forces operate when two marginalized communities interact within an oppressive system.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term <U+201C>Nigerian Lives Matter.<U+201E> They appropriated from <U+201C>Black Lives Matter,<U+201E> the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans<U+2019> familiarity with America<U+2019>s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era.\",\"published_in\":\"Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Abimbola A.

In short, white backlash is built into the liberal construction of race. Utilizing Joel Olson<U+2019>s conception of Herrenvolk democracy, this article analyzes how the color-blind norm of race moves race into a sphere of discourse where it is omnipresent but also disempowered for any legal remedy. Policing becomes an institution by which race is made apparent, as the inequitable treatment by the police dictates who is protected by the color line. Drawn from polling surveys and government reports, data is provided with regard to the unchanging perceptions of racial attitudes. Black Lives Matter takes up the Black radical tradition in order to reassert Black humanity in the face of a system that normalizes racial violence, racial terror, and its own racial ignorance. In this way BLM displays the counternarrative to white hegemony. This counternarrative forces us to realize the depth of the race problem by mobilizing a language of abolition. Circling back to Olson<U+2019>s abolition democracy, this article concludes by looking at how far we must go in terms of applying abolition to our discourse, language, conception of humanity, and democracy.<\\/jats:p>\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 2, page 311-323 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Briscoe, Chaz\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.2.311\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"bcefa1242cfc9058e42c3130b783d68c82521b49934eedc0b16d02fc7ac2460e\",\"relevance\":39},{\"id\":\"147e8145101c04e4b2d974affb0427fff71d0b6ec2e3e8e4f44252587a6af966\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/rep.2018.33\",\"title\":\"Do All Black Lives Matter Equally to Black People?

However, the contemporary movement for Black Lives calls for an intersectional approach to Black politics. Its platform requires participants to take seriously the notion that since Black communities are diverse, so are the needs of its members. To what extent are Blacks likely to believe that those who face secondary marginalization should be prioritized on the Black political agenda? What is the role of linked fate in galvanizing support around these marginalized Blacks? To what extent does respectability politics serve to hinder a broader embrace of Blacks who face different sets of interlocking systems of oppression, such as Black women, formerly incarcerated Blacks, undocumented Black people, and Black members of LBGTQ communities in an era marked by Black social movements?

A sample of 187 adolescents ages 15 to 23 completed surveys, and hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to identify variables associated with psychological outcomes.

White supremacists and White nationalists did not hide their racist ideologies as they demanded that their privileged place in history not be erased. The BLM movement, which challenges state-sanctioned anti-Black racism, was ready to confront themes of White discontent and reverse racism, critiques of political correctness, and the assumption that racialized people should know their place and be content to be the subordinate other.It is easy to frame the events in Charlottesville as indicative of US-specific race problems. However, a sense that White spaces should prevail and an ongoing history of anti-Black racism are not unique to the United States. The rise of Canadian activism under the BLM banner also signals a movement to change Canadian forms of institutional racism in policing, education, and the labor market. This article responds to perceptions that the BLM movement has given insufficient attention to environmental concerns (Pellow 2016; Halpern 2017). Drawing on critical race theory as a conceptual tool, this article focuses on the Canadian context as part of the author<U+2019>s argument in favor of greater collaboration between BLM and the environmental justice (EJ) movement in Canada.

Atheism here, while indeed denying the existence of gods, has as its primary concern affirming life. Too often is theology, as theologian Anthony Pinn says, <U+201C>a theology of no-body<U+201D>; thus atheistic feminist Blackness, as understood here, seeks to entrench the body rather than abstract it. Atheistic feminist Blackness reinscribes and affirms the subjectivity and humanity of Black, female, and trans bodies, countering hegemonic discourse that explicitly and implicitly states otherwise. The article<U+2019>s emphasis of an atheistic posture stems from the prescient words of Catherine Keller: <U+201C>atheist or agnostic feminists ignore the God-word at their own peril.<U+201D> Therefore, the Black feminist ideological argument takes the <U+201C>God-word<U+201D> seriously, reckons with it, and offers an alternative to a theological tradition that often imbues the body with inherent flaw (sin), abstraction (soul), and erasure of the ontological value of Black, female, and noncisgendered bodies.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Feminist Scholarship, Iss 9, Pp 1-17 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"atheism; radical feminism; Blackness; embodiment; Black Lives Matter; Women.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship<U+2019>s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement. It also explores the implications of education, engagement, and activism for people of color and libraries today. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The authors have engaged the topic from a critical race perspective as a practice in exercising voice <U+2013> telling stories, presenting counterstories, and practicing advocacy (Ladson-Billings, 1998). Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields. This paper has implications for developing understanding of questions about equitable service provision.\",\"published_in\":\"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal, 36(8)\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"black lives matter; library; social justice; community; inclusion; libraries; communities; neutrality; diversity; equity\",\"subject\":\"black lives matter; library; social justice; community; inclusion; libraries; communities; neutrality; diversity; equity\",\"authors\":\"index:\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17615\\/pyyv-r646\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e644bc514b8c2bb5339de461ada6ebe7c30d125c633eeae192c4e71f8b3d7fe4\",\"relevance\":32},{\"id\":\"f26a8dc521932e9ee4a3ba012b5ae40f81ed2b9d3b3ef2f360255f9a96728608\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1080\\/23311983.2017.1390917; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2331-1983; 2331-1983; doi:10.1080\\/23311983.2017.1390917; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f0804f5fb081489385fbc8857a8c756d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/23311983.2017.1390917; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f0804f5fb081489385fbc8857a8c756d\",\"title\":\"What<U+2019>s wrong with inevitable progress?

The gendered dimension of these issues tends to be fiercely disputed and has competing understandings in online spaces. This study combined issue network analysis and grounded theory to produce a contextualised exploration of the ways in which sexism was understood in such communities. Analysis of multi-modal data revealed three categories which were strategic in framing this debate including; 1) potential (mis)recognition of such behaviours within these contexts, 2) mistaken emphasis upon the gendered dimension of identity within interactions, and 3) qualification to <U+2018>count<U+2019> and be heard on these issues.

In this paper, I explore the temporality of emergency, through reflections on the use of declarations of emergency in relation to US-based Black Lives Matter protests. I do so in the context of claims and counter-claims about contemporary transformations in what Rheinhart Kosselleck (2004: 241) terms the <U+2018>expected otherness of the future<U+2019>. Arguing for changes in the form of the <U+2018>expected otherness of the future<U+2019> rather than its simple loss, disappearance or absence, I describe how emergency operates around a temporality of exceptionality, urgency and interval. Formal and informal declarations of emergency are, in addition, imbued with hope: the hope that time remains and action can make a difference to events. What the use of declarations of emergency by Black Lives Matter activists does is disrupt the geo-historically specific divide between the everyday and emergency by naming conditions that mix the endemic and the evental as emergencies. In the spark of hope that is the act of declaring that ongoing conditions should be treated as emergencies, the <U+2018>otherness of the future<U+2019> folds into and becomes part of the present.\",\"published_in\":\"Sociological review, 2017, Vol.65(3), pp.463-477 [Peer Reviewed Journal]\",\"year\":\"2017-09-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Anderson, B.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dro.dur.ac.uk\\/20324\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f8529f6d014ebb6bd18b76fa0c3dbab11abf32a47ef98b5e1aa325fdffba74bb\",\"relevance\":25},{\"id\":\"8f1836a526658a3b4688606de7522726ed38ef02e6600acdbde9ddd5f814f0c2\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.15367\\/kf.v3i1.87\",\"title\":\"Flesh in the Street\",\"paper_abstract\":\"<jats:p>&lt;p class=\\\"p1\\\"&gt;Much has been written in various media outlets regarding the causes of, meanings of, and, to some extent, solutions to events in Ferguson. Also debated is whether or not a genuine social movement is emerging, what form it is taking, and if it can be sustained as places like New York, Cleveland, and Baltimore take Ferguson<U+2019>s place on the front page. While much of this work assumes the Ferguson Protest Movement and the now more widely known Black Lives Matter movement to be one and the same, a closer look suggests that the Ferguson protestors maintain organizational and political distinctions unique to this particular group and place. With this in mind, it is important to consider two questions. What was specifically different about the death of Michael Brown and the place in which he lived and died, such that this event sparked sustained protests around the world? And what is different about the core group of protestors that emerged from the events in Ferguson, Missouri?&lt;\\/p&gt;&lt;p class=\\\"p2\\\"&gt;This essay considers a potential paradigm shift in the struggle against the well-honed logics of racialization in the United States and offers a little hope toward the future. As leaders of the early protests in Ferguson would later describe, the need to place their bodies directly on the front lines of the militarized police action initially rose as a response to the spectral flesh of Michael Brown<U+2019>s body and had as much to do with pushing back against the historical disciplining of their bodies in space<U+2014>as bodies out of place<U+2014>as it did with protesting yet another police officer abusing deadly force. This was the critical factor that sparked another kind of flesh in the street in the form of the Ferguson Protest Movement. This intentionally orchestrated spectacle<U+2014>of unapologetic Black life and flesh<U+2014>in turn breathed new life into a fledgling movement that simply insisted that &lt;em&gt;Black lives matter&lt;\\/em&gt;.&lt;\\/p&gt;<\\/jats:p>\",\"published_in\":\"Kalfou ; volume 3, issue 1 ; ISSN 2372-0751 2151-4712\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Rios, Jodi\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.15367\\/kf.v3i1.87\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8f1836a526658a3b4688606de7522726ed38ef02e6600acdbde9ddd5f814f0c2\",\"relevance\":24},{\"id\":\"bc85d9c381cc5653a1ec8e134a661b04c4937b85a6768f938811e67a85b57380\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unisalento.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18689; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2421-2113; 2421-2113; doi:10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p101; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f9de2bc6627b49d6ac8d2f757160fc1f\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p101; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f9de2bc6627b49d6ac8d2f757160fc1f\",\"title\":\"More Threatened Than Safe: What African, Caribbean, and Black Youth Living In Southern Ontario Say About Their Interactions with Law Enforcement.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study investigates the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) youth living in Windsor, Ontario regarding their interactions with police.

Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants.

The movement was born from a deep frustration over police brutality under the Obama administration and the feeling that justice was not served in court in spite of unquestionable evidence. What is original is that the rallying cry came from Facebook, leading up to the creation of an international organization. Its platform is much larger than police brutality and includes gay rights, women<U+2019>s right, discrimination in various forms and socioeconomic injustices as well ethical\\/metaphysical concerns. Social movements tend to become less effective when they become institutionalized. While BLM gained the support from some institutions, increasing its political influence, it remains to be seen what directions the movement will take. For now, even though the movement denounces the deep divisions of the nation, it is making strides in society, sparking discussions on its agenda and what it means to be black in many circles. ; Dans cet article, je m<U+2019>attelle <U+00E0> d<U+00E9>chiffrer le contexte dans lequel le mouvement Black Lives Matter (BLM) est apparu, tout en me penchant sur son impact depuis sa courte existence.

The movement was born from a deep frustration over police brutality under the Obama administration and the feeling that justice was not served in court in spite of unquestionable evidence. What is original is that the rallying cry came from Facebook, leading up to the creation of an international organization. Its platform is much larger than police brutality and includes gay rights, women<U+2019>s right, discrimination in various forms and socioeconomic injustices as well ethical\\/metaphysical concerns. Social movements tend to become less effective when they become institutionalized. While BLM gained the support from some institutions, increasing its political influence, it remains to be seen what directions the movement will take. For now, even though the movement denounces the deep divisions of the nation, it is making strides in society, sparking discussions on its agenda and what it means to be black in many circles. ; Dans cet article, je m<U+2019>attelle <U+00E0> d<U+00E9>chiffrer le contexte dans lequel le mouvement Black Lives Matter (BLM) est apparu, tout en me penchant sur son impact depuis sa courte existence.

This article examines the motivations of participants in these events. Drawing upon data from surveys of protesters outside the 2008 national party conventions, it focuses on how partisan and independent political identifications correspond with the reasons that individuals give for protesting. The results demonstrate that there are some conditions under which independents place a greater focus on issues than do partisans and under which partisans place a greater focus on presidential candidates than do independents. However, there are also conditions under which independents are inclined to work alongside partisans, such as trying to stop the election of a threatening candidate and in championing an issue outside their opposing party<U+2019>s convention. The article argues that micro-level partisan identifications are thus likely to affect the broader structure of party coalitions.

Seussian pedagogy teaches us to hear all persons as whos rather than whats or things. Yet this essay argues that all persons are also things.

Yet, there is another group, Native Americans, whose members have experienced very high levels of fatal encounters with the police, but whose deaths arguably have not generated media attention. In this research, we tracked the numbers of African American and Native American deaths associated with police use of lethal force as well as fatalities in police custody following arrest from May 1, 2014, through the end of October 2016. Then, we examined the extent of mainstream media coverage given to these fatalities in the 10 highest circulation newspapers in the United States.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley<U+2019>s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes<U+2019>s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism. The issue at stake is how exemplary crime fictions make sense of, and critically interrogate, the relationship between race, violence and neoliberalism.

Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life<U+2014>the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment<U+2014>is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles<U+2014>liberation, inspiration, and healing<U+2014>to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life.

This experience is shared with an increasing number of young people in the developed North who are also grappling with issues of joblessness and political exclusion. This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people's needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change. However, they have not yet been able to effect systemic change. While profound social transformation takes time, this generation is still wrestling with how to move beyond street protest and have a lasting impact on politics and governance.

At the same time, the unfolding Black Lives Matter protest movements and the responses by federal agencies each testify to a not insignificant capacity for addressing social pathologies surrounding the color line. In order to respond to this ambivalent situation, this article suggests a pairing between the work of James Baldwin and that of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. I will argue that we cannot fully appreciate the depths of what Baldwin called the <U+201C>savage paradox<U+201D> of race without the insights provided by Klein and object relations psychoanalysis. Conversely, Baldwin helps us to sound out the political significance of object relations approaches, including the work of Klein and those influenced by her such as Hanna Segal and Wilfred Bion.

This study investigates the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) youth living in Windsor, Ontario regarding their interactions with police. Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.

Examining punishment discourses intersectionally unearths profound, unequal distinctions when controlling for the variety of victims<U+2019> identities within the punishment regime. For example, trans women of color are likely to face the harshest of realties when confronted with the prospect of punishment. However, missing from much of the academic carceral literature is a critical perspective situated in racialized epistemic frameworks. If racialized individuals are more likely to be affected by punishment systems, then, certainly, they are the foremost experts on what those realities are like. The Black Lives Matter hashtag came about during the aftermath of the George Zimmerman non-verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and it helped to cultivate the organization which turned into a multiracial international movement in defense of Black dignity and humanity. While Black Lives Matter was initially inspired by police violence, it has expanded its reach to include causes beyond police malpractice and brutality. This special issue of The Prison Journal seeks to merge principles associated with Black Lives Matter (as noted on their website) with critical issues endemic to community reentry after incarceration and the racialized and gendered impediments it produces. The empirical pieces included are qualitative to reflect the epistemologies of the affected, as we believe that narratives more powerfully capture these hard-to-reach (or deviant in comparison to the norm) perspectives. This special issue includes articles that critically foreground the voices of formerly incarcerated citizens (including some who are mothers and fathers) and reentry service providers. Importantly, it provides suggestions for new directions in reimagining a more democratic and racially equitable society without current punishment regimes. <\\/jats:p> Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law The Prison Journal ; volume 99, issue 4, page 387-395 ; ISSN 0032-8855 1552-7522 Williams, Jason M.\"},{\"id\":\"6ae075d49e7055f800dcc269ecda57bbf09175e55b6283f519b5eedfa27f9c2f\",\"content\":\"Blackening Canada Because Black Lives Matter A review of Barrett, Paul. 2015.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, <U+201C>Black lives matter!<U+201D> This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action. Note: UDP is a platform for voices to be heard. Therefore, this is a personal, self-reflection article for a specific population, and is not a reflection of the beliefs of UDP.

We suggest that community psychologists, advocates, and policymakers use perspectives and values embedded within Community Psychology in order to help combat this issue. This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.

The author argues on the basis of recent field research that this movement is most adequately understood from a theological ethics standpoint through a performativity lens, as a form of quasi-liturgical participation that constructs collective identity and sustains collective agency. The author draws upon ethnographic methods in order to demonstrate that the public moral critique of the movement is embedded in four interlocking narratives, and to interrogate the Catholic theological discipline itself as an object of this moral critique in light of its own performative habituation to whiteness.<\\/jats:p>  Horizons ; volume 44, issue 2, page 306-341 ; ISSN 0360-9669 2050-8557 Jaycox, Michael P.\"},{\"id\":\"f159e45cddba9db9a474b6fb268877c0f20cf25bdb8649777377b7dcb7bb1b6e\",\"content\":\"La pelle del selfie This is an essay about power and faces.

Furthermore, BLM is critical of various institutions that create disparities, including the criminal justice system. This article examines the nexus of BLM and prisoner reentry. Using qualitative research conducted in the weeks and months following the death of Trayvon Martin in February 2012, a collective of formerly incarcerated and recently released Black men discussed and analyzed this death and its impact on the Black community.

The second key finding is that BLM organizations generated more tweets that framed the movement as a struggle for individual rights than ones that utilized frames about gender, racial, and LGBTQ identities. Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists urge their followers to pursue disruptive repertoires of contention less frequently than they encourage other political behaviors.

Teacher-scholars can and should take advantage of the renewed interest in systemic threats to black life in the United States when teaching about past victims of state-sanctioned violence including Celia, an enslaved teenager executed for killing her master after years of sexual abuse. In doing so, they can not only draw useful connections between the past and present but also lay the foundations for a more meaningful study of black radicalism and black resistance in the United States.

Soul dawning entails acknowledging the humanity of others without erasing difference.

Part of the political import of BLM is its capacity to illustrate how practices of soul blindness in the U.S. constitute whiteness in a racialized police order.

Working against the backdrop of the <U+2018>Black Lives Matter<U+2019> movement that originated in the United States, this article analyses the socio-political and cultural frameworks that affirm Whiteness whilst concomitantly, denigrating Blackness. The author, a well-known Black liberation theologian, who is a child of the Windrush Generation, argues that Western Mission Christianity has always exemplified a deep-seated form of anti-Blackness that has helped to shape the agency of Black bodies, essentially marking them as <U+2018>less than<U+2019>. This theological base has created the frameworks that have dictated the sematic belief that Black bodies do not really matter and if they do, then they are invariably second-class ones when compared to White bodies.

The Dylan Yang case, in which a Hmong teen was convicted of murder for the stabbing of another boy, perceived to be black Latino, in an altercation at his home, demands comparative racialization analytics to gain perspective on the implementation of unequal justice. Unpacking the effects of the gangster stereotype, especially for Southeast Asian youth, we suggest how, despite the Asian American model minority trope, Hmong American boys have been racialized as monstrous thugs comparable (but not identical) to their black and Latino counterparts, and thus treated by law enforcement as suspects in need of <U+201C>cataloging<U+201D> as part of the school-to-prison pipeline. We also delve into the actual practices of young men in order to reveal their strategies in tense and conflictual multiracial contexts, then turn to issues such as long sentences and juvenile solitary confinement that imply the disposability of young lives of color.

Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group <U+2018>allies<U+2019>. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term <U+201C>Nigerian Lives Matter.<U+201E> They appropriated from <U+201C>Black Lives Matter,<U+201E> the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans<U+2019> familiarity with America<U+2019>s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era. performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019) Abimbola A.

Alexander : Interviewed by Anna Lund and Andrea Voyer In this interview, Jeffrey C. Alexander describes the development of cultural sociology, the importance of collaborative work, and the inspiration he takes from his political action, and from the art and humanities. The interview focuses primarily on civil sphere theory (CST), and Alexander<U+2019>s goal in moving towards Durkheimian and away from Parsonian conceptions of solidarity. Alexander addresses common misunderstandings and critiques of CST, describes the current project of the internationalization of CST, and applies the theory to the present crisis of a global pandemic and the social movement of Black Lives Matter. Finally, Alexander reflects upon life in the academic world and the importance of not only analyzing meaning as a cultural sociologist but also working with meaningful projects in order to not be alienated.

I structured my 400-level Race and Ethnicity course to build on the momentum of these conversations by incorporating a student-led race-centric research project whereby students learn and apply in-depth interview skills. Through this qualitative group project, students interviewed 31 members of the university community to investigate colorblindness, racial identity, privilege, racialized experiences, and institutional racism on their campus. In this article, I describe the project, and consider its strengths and limitations as a means of student learning about race, privilege, and discrimination in the U.S. today.

In short, white backlash is built into the liberal construction of race. Utilizing Joel Olson<U+2019>s conception of Herrenvolk democracy, this article analyzes how the color-blind norm of race moves race into a sphere of discourse where it is omnipresent but also disempowered for any legal remedy. Policing becomes an institution by which race is made apparent, as the inequitable treatment by the police dictates who is protected by the color line. Drawn from polling surveys and government reports, data is provided with regard to the unchanging perceptions of racial attitudes. Black Lives Matter takes up the Black radical tradition in order to reassert Black humanity in the face of a system that normalizes racial violence, racial terror, and its own racial ignorance. In this way BLM displays the counternarrative to white hegemony. This counternarrative forces us to realize the depth of the race problem by mobilizing a language of abolition. Circling back to Olson<U+2019>s abolition democracy, this article concludes by looking at how far we must go in terms of applying abolition to our discourse, language, conception of humanity, and democracy.<\\/jats:p>  National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 2, page 311-323 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113 Briscoe, Chaz\"},{\"id\":\"147e8145101c04e4b2d974affb0427fff71d0b6ec2e3e8e4f44252587a6af966\",\"content\":\"Do All Black Lives Matter Equally to Black People?

However, the contemporary movement for Black Lives calls for an intersectional approach to Black politics. Its platform requires participants to take seriously the notion that since Black communities are diverse, so are the needs of its members. To what extent are Blacks likely to believe that those who face secondary marginalization should be prioritized on the Black political agenda? What is the role of linked fate in galvanizing support around these marginalized Blacks? To what extent does respectability politics serve to hinder a broader embrace of Blacks who face different sets of interlocking systems of oppression, such as Black women, formerly incarcerated Blacks, undocumented Black people, and Black members of LBGTQ communities in an era marked by Black social movements?

Indicators of resilience are attributes and resources of an individual and the environment that predict positive adjustment. The purpose of this study was to examine the presence of resilience indicators across three ecological levels (individual, familial, environmental) among disadvantaged youth living in Lebanon and to examine whether indicators were associated with psychological well-being and psychological distress. A sample of 187 adolescents ages 15 to 23 completed surveys, and hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to identify variables associated with psychological outcomes. Higher self-efficacy, curiosity, social support, and the availability\\/involvement with spiritual, cultural, and educational opportunities were related to greater psychological wellbeing. Low self-efficacy was the only indicator that was associated with psychological distress independently above and beyond demographic characteristics. Results support the potential importance of considering resilience indicators across ecological levels for interventions seeking to promote positive psychological outcomes for adolescents in highly stressful contexts. psychology; adolescence; resilience Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 136-149 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

However, little research has focused on social movements in particular. Through a content analysis of all public tweets sent by Black Lives Matter (BLM) over a four-year period, this study examined the message strategies used on Twitter by the social movement as a means to share information, build community, and promote action. Consistent with research on other types of organizations, informational messages proved to be the most common. The study also analyzed the influence that these strategies had on audience engagement in terms of replies and retweets.

White supremacists and White nationalists did not hide their racist ideologies as they demanded that their privileged place in history not be erased. The BLM movement, which challenges state-sanctioned anti-Black racism, was ready to confront themes of White discontent and reverse racism, critiques of political correctness, and the assumption that racialized people should know their place and be content to be the subordinate other.It is easy to frame the events in Charlottesville as indicative of US-specific race problems. However, a sense that White spaces should prevail and an ongoing history of anti-Black racism are not unique to the United States. The rise of Canadian activism under the BLM banner also signals a movement to change Canadian forms of institutional racism in policing, education, and the labor market. This article responds to perceptions that the BLM movement has given insufficient attention to environmental concerns (Pellow 2016; Halpern 2017). Drawing on critical race theory as a conceptual tool, this article focuses on the Canadian context as part of the author<U+2019>s argument in favor of greater collaboration between BLM and the environmental justice (EJ) movement in Canada.

Atheism here, while indeed denying the existence of gods, has as its primary concern affirming life. Too often is theology, as theologian Anthony Pinn says, <U+201C>a theology of no-body<U+201D>; thus atheistic feminist Blackness, as understood here, seeks to entrench the body rather than abstract it. Atheistic feminist Blackness reinscribes and affirms the subjectivity and humanity of Black, female, and trans bodies, countering hegemonic discourse that explicitly and implicitly states otherwise. The article<U+2019>s emphasis of an atheistic posture stems from the prescient words of Catherine Keller: <U+201C>atheist or agnostic feminists ignore the God-word at their own peril.<U+201D> Therefore, the Black feminist ideological argument takes the <U+201C>God-word<U+201D> seriously, reckons with it, and offers an alternative to a theological tradition that often imbues the body with inherent flaw (sin), abstraction (soul), and erasure of the ontological value of Black, female, and noncisgendered bodies. atheism; radical feminism; Blackness; embodiment; Black Lives Matter; Women.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship<U+2019>s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement. It also explores the implications of education, engagement, and activism for people of color and libraries today. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The authors have engaged the topic from a critical race perspective as a practice in exercising voice <U+2013> telling stories, presenting counterstories, and practicing advocacy (Ladson-Billings, 1998). Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields. This paper has implications for developing understanding of questions about equitable service provision. black lives matter; library; social justice; community; inclusion; libraries; communities; neutrality; diversity; equity Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal, 36(8) index:\"},{\"id\":\"f26a8dc521932e9ee4a3ba012b5ae40f81ed2b9d3b3ef2f360255f9a96728608\",\"content\":\"What<U+2019>s wrong with inevitable progress?

In public discourse, gaming is becoming increasingly synonymous with sexism; with media reporting harassment of female-identifying gamers as well as those who voice concern about these issues. The gendered dimension of these issues tends to be fiercely disputed and has competing understandings in online spaces. This study combined issue network analysis and grounded theory to produce a contextualised exploration of the ways in which sexism was understood in such communities. Analysis of multi-modal data revealed three categories which were strategic in framing this debate including; 1) potential (mis)recognition of such behaviours within these contexts, 2) mistaken emphasis upon the gendered dimension of identity within interactions, and 3) qualification to <U+2018>count<U+2019> and be heard on these issues. Online spaces reproduce inequalities that exist offline and owing to the technological affordances and contextual nuances, are also sites of cultural production where relations of gendered power may be configured.

We suggest that community psychologists, advocates, and policymakers use perspectives and values embedded within Community Psychology in order to help combat this issue. This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.

Emergency as a descriptor, technique and legal-political device has become a taken-for-granted way of apprehending and governing events and situations. In this paper, I explore the temporality of emergency, through reflections on the use of declarations of emergency in relation to US-based Black Lives Matter protests. I do so in the context of claims and counter-claims about contemporary transformations in what Rheinhart Kosselleck (2004: 241) terms the <U+2018>expected otherness of the future<U+2019>. Arguing for changes in the form of the <U+2018>expected otherness of the future<U+2019> rather than its simple loss, disappearance or absence, I describe how emergency operates around a temporality of exceptionality, urgency and interval. Formal and informal declarations of emergency are, in addition, imbued with hope: the hope that time remains and action can make a difference to events. What the use of declarations of emergency by Black Lives Matter activists does is disrupt the geo-historically specific divide between the everyday and emergency by naming conditions that mix the endemic and the evental as emergencies. In the spark of hope that is the act of declaring that ongoing conditions should be treated as emergencies, the <U+2018>otherness of the future<U+2019> folds into and becomes part of the present.

Also debated is whether or not a genuine social movement is emerging, what form it is taking, and if it can be sustained as places like New York, Cleveland, and Baltimore take Ferguson<U+2019>s place on the front page. While much of this work assumes the Ferguson Protest Movement and the now more widely known Black Lives Matter movement to be one and the same, a closer look suggests that the Ferguson protestors maintain organizational and political distinctions unique to this particular group and place. With this in mind, it is important to consider two questions. What was specifically different about the death of Michael Brown and the place in which he lived and died, such that this event sparked sustained protests around the world? And what is different about the core group of protestors that emerged from the events in Ferguson, Missouri?&lt;\\/p&gt;&lt;p class=\\\"p2\\\"&gt;This essay considers a potential paradigm shift in the struggle against the well-honed logics of racialization in the United States and offers a little hope toward the future. As leaders of the early protests in Ferguson would later describe, the need to place their bodies directly on the front lines of the militarized police action initially rose as a response to the spectral flesh of Michael Brown<U+2019>s body and had as much to do with pushing back against the historical disciplining of their bodies in space<U+2014>as bodies out of place<U+2014>as it did with protesting yet another police officer abusing deadly force. This was the critical factor that sparked another kind of flesh in the street in the form of the Ferguson Protest Movement.

This study investigates the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) youth living in Windsor, Ontario regarding their interactions with police. Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.

A history of Chicago gangs reveals that gangs are not one thing; at times they have played positive roles within schools and taken part in social movements. The author<U+2019>s personal experiences with gangs and schools in Milwaukee and Chicago are presented as evidence documenting the mutability of gangs, the damaging consequences of some educational policies, and the importance of including gang members in social movements.

Les mouvements sociaux tendent <U+00E0> devenir moins radicaux lorsqu<U+2019>ils deviennent <U+00E0> leur tour des institutions.

It explores the ways in which Twitter users (and students) are developing a globally-connected voice to not only build awareness and solidarity, but also challenge the framing of issues relating to #blacklivesmatter and the ways blacks are represented by a variety of political actors, including the mainstream media. The paper identifies two trends in teaching #blacklivesmatter and its relevance to the classroom: historicizing the <U+201C>new<U+201D> civil rights movement and the use of testimony and discussion as a new praxis. The authors conclude that students must be reminded of their ability to influence their own lives by using their personal stories and seizing their voice.

In the epilogue, I ponder another round of revisions given the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

It was represented by a rich cross section of artistic work, often forged by young urban artists in genres as diverse as music, dance, visual arts, literature and theatre. No aesthetic was unaffected by inflections of this new black consciousness. This article explores the ways in which, a half-century after the Black Arts Movement, African Americans in television have cultivated an aesthetic and politics that resonate with the core thrust of the Black Arts Movement, one that sets black people in the center of their own cultural and political narratives, and inextricably bound to the wider movements of social justice in black communities.

This article examines the motivations of participants in these events. Drawing upon data from surveys of protesters outside the 2008 national party conventions, it focuses on how partisan and independent political identifications correspond with the reasons that individuals give for protesting. The results demonstrate that there are some conditions under which independents place a greater focus on issues than do partisans and under which partisans place a greater focus on presidential candidates than do independents. However, there are also conditions under which independents are inclined to work alongside partisans, such as trying to stop the election of a threatening candidate and in championing an issue outside their opposing party<U+2019>s convention. The article argues that micro-level partisan identifications are thus likely to affect the broader structure of party coalitions. These considerations promise to become increasingly relevant as social movements <U+2013> such as the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter <U+2013> launch new campaigns against or within established parties. <\\/jats:p>  Research & Politics ; volume 3, issue 4, page 205316801667413 ; ISSN 2053-1680 2053-1680 Heaney, Michael T.\"},{\"id\":\"0da70c0a1524085dcafe8d7040f438cc7da297a18cc1d67f434ef95c8d9d3d84\",\"content\":\"Seuss and the Swerve of Singularity <jats:title>Abstract<\\/jats:title> <jats:p>This article explores the unstable distinction between <U+201C>who<U+201D> and <U+201C>what<U+201D> in Seuss<U+2019>s Horton Hears a Who!

Seussian pedagogy teaches us to hear all persons as whos rather than whats or things. Yet this essay argues that all persons are also things. While this thingliness remains unequally distributed thanks to persistent sociopolitical hierarchies, it also calls on us to think about ethics and politics differently. Diverging from the person\\/who equation, Jacques Derrida conceives the who as an absolute singularity that resists its subjection to the what, and by extension, its reduction to particularity and identity. Expanding beyond Horton<U+2019>s racial context, the final section of the essay considers how the contemporary <U+201C>Black Lives Matter<U+201D> movement reckons with the problem of particularity and identity while also gesturing toward an incalculable singularity<U+2014>infinitely deferred yet always <U+201C>present.<U+201D><\\/jats:p> Literature and Literary Theory Comparative Literature ; volume 71, issue 3, page 298-313 ; ISSN 0010-4124 1945-8517 Peterson, Christopher\"},{\"id\":\"7a052b33ce0a9b1ec1cf01e15c0cc6b2794b6fccf0e29b0f77138c873f452627\",\"content\":\"Whose Lives Matter: The Media<U+2019>s Failure to Cover Police Use of Lethal Force Against Native Americans <jats:p> The August 9, 2014, police shooting of Michael Brown reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement and triggered widespread media scrutiny of police use of lethal force against African Americans. Yet, there is another group, Native Americans, whose members have experienced very high levels of fatal encounters with the police, but whose deaths arguably have not generated media attention. In this research, we tracked the numbers of African American and Native American deaths associated with police use of lethal force as well as fatalities in police custody following arrest from May 1, 2014, through the end of October 2016. Then, we examined the extent of mainstream media coverage given to these fatalities in the 10 highest circulation newspapers in the United States. Finally, we considered the reasons for the disparities between the two groups. <\\/jats:p>  Race and Justice ; volume 10, issue 2, page 150-175 ; ISSN 2153-3687 2153-3687 Schroedel, Jean Reith; Chin, Roger J.\"}]"}, "params": {"document_types": ["121"], "from": "1665-01-01", "language": "english", "limit": 120, "list_size": 100, "q": "\"black lives matter\"", "raw": true, "service": "base", "sorting": "most-relevant", "to": "2020-06-08"}}
