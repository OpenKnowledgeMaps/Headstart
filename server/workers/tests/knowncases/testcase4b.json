Seussian pedagogy teaches us to hear all persons as whos rather than whats or things. Yet this essay argues that all persons are also things. While this thingliness remains unequally distributed thanks to persistent sociopolitical hierarchies, it also calls on us to think about ethics and politics differently. Diverging from the person\\\\\\/who equation, Jacques Derrida conceives the who as an absolute singularity that resists its subjection to the what, and by extension, its reduction to particularity and identity. Expanding beyond Horton\\u2019s racial context, the final section of the essay considers how the contemporary \\u201cBlack Lives Matter\\u201d movement reckons with the problem of particularity and identity while also gesturing toward an incalculable singularity\\u2014infinitely deferred yet always \\u201cpresent.\\u201d\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"200506 - North American Literature; 200525 - Literary Theory; 970120 - Expanding Knowledge in Languages; Communication and Culture; Seuss; Dr; Derrida; Jacques; identity (psychology); American literature; history and criticism\",\"subject\":\"- North American Literature;- Literary Theory;- Expanding Knowledge in Languages; Communication and Culture; Seuss; Dr; Derrida; Jacques; identity (psychology); American literature; history and criticism\",\"authors\":\"Peterson, Christopher (R14092)\",\"link\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doi.org\\\\\\/10.1215\\\\\\/00104124-7546298\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"0059622c5b24f56bb9459fa4d478d7e48ebf09102817a94426e5a8cce7e9a98f\",\"relevance\":2},{\"id\":\"038bb5091776c6afda692ffbf03405f4b440b25ca80ecac6ac74bce408a265ef\",\"relation\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/www.revista.ueg.br\\\\\\/index.php\\\\\\/revistahistoria\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/view\\\\\\/5272\\\\\\/4409\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/www.revista.ueg.br\\\\\\/index.php\\\\\\/revistahistoria\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/view\\\\\\/5272\",\"title\":\"A utopia p\\u00f3s-racial nos Estados Unidos: reestrutura\\u00e7\\u00e3o do racismo e a ascens\\u00e3o de Barack Obama na era do colorblindness\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Resumo: o objetivo deste artigo \\u00e9 o de analisar, atrav\\u00e9s de uma perspectiva hist\\u00f3rica, a era p\\u00f3s-direitos civis nos Estados Unidos, demonstrando a reestrutura\\u00e7\\u00e3o do racismo norte-americano e a cren\\u00e7a em uma sociedade p\\u00f3s-racial a partir de 1980.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 85-100 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Black Lives Matter; Black women; anti-racism; mental health; social determinants of health; Philosophy.

Although Daniher describes here a course and learning experience from within a US-American institutional setting, she directs the following emergent queries to the field of Canadian Theatre and Performance Studies in light of its recent inauguration of the new \\u201csub-field\\u201d of Asian Canadian Theatre and Performance Studies: How should we frame Asian Canadian theatre and performance in the classroom? For what purpose and under what curricular conditions do we teach racialized \\u201cminority\\u201d repertoires of theatre and performance in Canada? Drawing on overlapping genealogies of Asian American and Asian Canadian Studies, Daniher contends that a more rigorous engagement with existing theories, methods, and critical analyses of racial power is urgently needed if Asian Canadian Theatre Studies hopes to coincide with the larger political-ethical stakes of \\u201cAsian Canadian studies projects\\u201d writ-large. ; Dans cet article, Colleen Kim Daniher pr\\u00e9sente une justification critique de sa d\\u00e9cision de mettre en pratique une m\\u00e9thode comparative ax\\u00e9e sur un contenu asio-am\\u00e9ricain dans un cours sur les \\u00e9tudes du th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre et de la performance asio-am\\u00e9ricains qu\\u2019elle a enseign\\u00e9 \\u00e0 l\\u2019Universit\\u00e9 Brown au printemps 2016.

The movement was born from a deep frustration over police brutality under the Obama administration and the feeling that justice was not served in court in spite of unquestionable evidence. What is original is that the rallying cry came from Facebook, leading up to the creation of an international organization. Its platform is much larger than police brutality and includes gay rights, women\\u2019s right, discrimination in various forms and socioeconomic injustices as well ethical\\\\\\/metaphysical concerns. Social movements tend to become less effective when they become institutionalized. While BLM gained the support from some institutions, increasing its political influence, it remains to be seen what directions the movement will take. For now, even though the movement denounces the deep divisions of the nation, it is making strides in society, sparking discussions on its agenda and what it means to be black in many circles. ; Dans cet article, je m\\u2019attelle \\u00e0 d\\u00e9chiffrer le contexte dans lequel le mouvement Black Lives Matter (BLM) est apparu, tout en me penchant sur son impact depuis sa courte existence.

This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people's needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change.

The Dylan Yang case, in which a Hmong teen was convicted of murder for the stabbing of another boy, perceived to be black Latino, in an altercation at his home, demands comparative racialization analytics to gain perspective on the implementation of unequal justice. Unpacking the effects of the gangster stereotype, especially for Southeast Asian youth, we suggest how, despite the Asian American model minority trope, Hmong American boys have been racialized as monstrous thugs comparable (but not identical) to their black and Latino counterparts, and thus treated by law enforcement as suspects in need of \\u201ccataloging\\u201d as part of the school-to-prison pipeline. We also delve into the actual practices of young men in order to reveal their strategies in tense and conflictual multiracial contexts, then turn to issues such as long sentences and juvenile solitary confinement that imply the disposability of young lives of color.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, \\u201cBlack lives matter!\\u201d This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action. Note: UDP is a platform for voices to be heard. Therefore, this is a personal, self-reflection article for a specific population, and is not a reflection of the beliefs of UDP.\",\"published_in\":\"Understanding and Dismantling Privilege; Vol 7 No 1 (2017): UNDERSTANDING AND DISMANTLING PRIVILEGE; 53-65 ; 2152-1875\",\"year\":\"2017-04-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"subject\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"authors\":\"Harper, Matt\",\"link\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/view\\\\\\/16458\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1fd7689619b8b0b8d201792590461cacf4c354bbeb31bb1b1fab6da9f303cdef\",\"relevance\":88},{\"id\":\"20cc664aae2f44aa31db039c954d418a1a8e03151b9a4b26a7f06d2be94f62ee\",\"relation\":\"http:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\\\\\/ojs\\\\\\/index.php\\\\\\/radicalteacher\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/view\\\\\\/305; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/toc\\\\\\/1941-0832; 1941-0832; doi:10.5195\\\\\\/rt.2016.305; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/56d350e22c5645d0bee6c25b66de8602\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doi.org\\\\\\/10.5195\\\\\\/rt.2016.305; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/56d350e22c5645d0bee6c25b66de8602\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter in Information Literacy\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The institutional racism addressed by the Black Lives Matter movement is encoded in many of the structures of academia, including academic libraries.

All Lives Matter. These two statements are both true, but connote very different sentiments in our current political reality. To further complicate matters, in this short reflection piece, I query how multiracial lives matter in the context of this heated social and political discussion about race. As a multiracial person committed to racial justice and sympathetic both to those pushing for recognition of multiracial identity and to those who worry such recognition may undermine larger movements, these are questions I have long grappled with both professionally and personally. Of course, multiracial lives matter-but do they constitute a sub-agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement, or is there an independent agenda the moniker \\\"Multiracial Lives Matter\\\" might represent? If the latter, is there a danger that such an agenda might be co-opted by other forces and used to further unintended purposes, such as the advancement of colorblindness? To the extent that agenda demands unique recognition of multiracial identity, how can it co-exist with broader identity-based racial justice movements?. ; 50 ; 719-724 ; 3\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017-06\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"after loving; creighton law; how multiracial\",\"authors\":\"Lucas, Lauren Sudeall\",\"link\":\"http:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/hdl.handle.net\\\\\\/10504\\\\\\/113299\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"26c720fd838b18441bbec5d86f3ec4f115cd9b4e82787111ae4ba4e429b8f37f\",\"relevance\":82},{\"id\":\"28bdc70b0cafea55005abdd7be2ad7bf9af8ebda7b976e160b995527b2fdf30b\",\"relation\":\"http:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/www.jfsonline.org\\\\\\/issue9\\\\\\/articles\\\\\\/bey\\\\\\/; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/toc\\\\\\/2158-6179; 2158-6179; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/12d5104216b344b49a39272b9ced2454\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/12d5104216b344b49a39272b9ced2454\",\"title\":\"She Had a Name That God Didn\\u2019t Give Her: Thinking the Body through Atheistic Black Radical Feminism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The article attempts to demonstrate the necessity of acknowledging the body when considering the current Black Lives Matter movement, give an account of Black female and trans erasure, and ultimately (re)affirm the lived embodiment of Black, female, and trans bodies, all through an atheistic lens. Atheism here, while indeed denying the existence of gods, has as its primary concern affirming life. Too often is theology, as theologian Anthony Pinn says, \\u201ca theology of no-body\\u201d; thus atheistic feminist Blackness, as understood here, seeks to entrench the body rather than abstract it. Atheistic feminist Blackness reinscribes and affirms the subjectivity and humanity of Black, female, and trans bodies, countering hegemonic discourse that explicitly and implicitly states otherwise. The article\\u2019s emphasis of an atheistic posture stems from the prescient words of Catherine Keller: \\u201catheist or agnostic feminists ignore the God-word at their own peril.\\u201d Therefore, the Black feminist ideological argument takes the \\u201cGod-word\\u201d seriously, reckons with it, and offers an alternative to a theological tradition that often imbues the body with inherent flaw (sin), abstraction (soul), and erasure of the ontological value of Black, female, and noncisgendered bodies.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Feminist Scholarship, Iss 9, Pp 1-17 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"atheism; radical feminism; Blackness; embodiment; Black Lives Matter; Women.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley\\u2019s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes\\u2019s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism. The issue at stake is how exemplary crime fictions make sense of, and critically interrogate, the relationship between race, violence and neoliberalism.\",\"published_in\":\"Pepper , A 2019 , ' Race, violence and neoliberalism: crime fiction in the era of Ferguson and Black Lives Matter ' , Textual Practice , vol. 33 , no. 6 , pp. 963-982 . https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doi.org\\\\\\/10.1080\\\\\\/0950236X.2017.1365755\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Race; violence; neoliberalism; crime fiction; The Wire; Ferguson; Black Lives Matter\",\"subject\":\"Race; violence; neoliberalism; crime fiction; The Wire; Ferguson; Black Lives Matter\",\"authors\":\"Pepper, Andrew\",\"link\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/pure.qub.ac.uk\\\\\\/en\\\\\\/publications\\\\\\/race-violence-and-neoliberalism-crime-fiction-in-the-era-of-ferguson-and-black-lives-matter(9bc7c63d-3cb7-4d26-867c-d655587e4033).html\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"2c9ededff77e84ed3a7b9a6653aaab1ac400a0a1798a6927ac119158f039597b\",\"relevance\":103},{\"id\":\"2d5cec540056e4fd46e29e6ecbda95c864e2ea8119b474d7d48fe681ee778dd3\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\\\\\/semantics\\\\\\/altIdentifier\\\\\\/doi\\\\\\/10.3917\\\\\\/rfea.152.0018; hal-02384404; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\\\\\/hal-02384404; doi:10.3917\\\\\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\\\\\/hal-02384404; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doi.org\\\\\\/10.3917\\\\\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization ; Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization: An interview with Melina Abdullah by Yohann Le Moigne\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Melina Abdullah is a scholar-activist.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 55-72 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Racism; Empowerment; Resilience; Black Lives Matter; Philosophy.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group \\u2018allies\\u2019. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-10-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"developing black; functions social; media developing\",\"authors\":\"Wilkins, D.J.; Livingstone, A.G.; Levine, M.\",\"link\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\\\\\\/id\\\\\\/eprint\\\\\\/131987\\\\\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"32938a80f4029cdcf71c763386d7e4839fda6eb77fe62058e9b530e0e96b7391\",\"relevance\":67},{\"id\":\"362ea7618bfa9501e474703ba76f5bfabb27d83388234602a7436fa136ab4911\",\"relation\":\"http:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\\\\\/ojs\\\\\\/radicalteacher\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/view\\\\\\/337\\\\\\/229; http:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\\\\\/ojs\\\\\\/radicalteacher\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/view\\\\\\/337; doi:10.5195\\\\\\/rt.2016.337\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\\\\\/ojs\\\\\\/radicalteacher\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/view\\\\\\/337; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doi.org\\\\\\/10.5195\\\\\\/rt.2016.337\",\"title\":\"Vernacular Insurrections: Race, Black Protest, and the New Century in Composition-Literacies Studies by Carmen Kynard\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Vernacular Insurrections Race, Black Protest, and the New Century in Composition-Literacies Studies is a masterful study of race, literacy, rhetoric and composition that deserves the widest readership.

At the same time, the unfolding Black Lives Matter protest movements and the responses by federal agencies each testify to a not insignificant capacity for addressing social pathologies surrounding the color line. In order to respond to this ambivalent situation, this article suggests a pairing between the work of James Baldwin and that of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. I will argue that we cannot fully appreciate the depths of what Baldwin called the \\u201csavage paradox\\u201d of race without the insights provided by Klein and object relations psychoanalysis. Conversely, Baldwin helps us to sound out the political significance of object relations approaches, including the work of Klein and those influenced by her such as Hanna Segal and Wilfred Bion. In conversation with the work of Baldwin, object relations theory can help to identify particular social settings and institutions that might allow concrete efforts toward racial justice to take root.\",\"published_in\":\"James Baldwin Review, Vol 2, Iss 0, Pp 75-96 (2016)\",\"year\":\"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"psychoanalysis; integration; Black Lives Matter; Melanie Klein; American literature; PS1-3576; Communities.

It was represented by a rich cross section of artistic work, often forged by young urban artists in genres as diverse as music, dance, visual arts, literature and theatre. No aesthetic was unaffected by inflections of this new black consciousness. This article explores the ways in which, a half-century after the Black Arts Movement, African Americans in television have cultivated an aesthetic and politics that resonate with the core thrust of the Black Arts Movement, one that sets black people in the center of their own cultural and political narratives, and inextricably bound to the wider movements of social justice in black communities.\",\"published_in\":\"European Journal of American Studies, Vol 14, Iss 1 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Black Arts Movement; Black Lives Matter; Black Power Movement; TV; Arts; History America; E-F; United States; E151-889; Sociology (General); HM401-1281\",\"subject\":\"Black Arts Movement; Black Lives Matter; Black Power Movement; TV; Arts; History America; E-F; United States; \",\"authors\":\"Jeffrey O.G.

In public discourse, gaming is becoming increasingly synonymous with sexism; with media reporting harassment of female-identifying gamers as well as those who voice concern about these issues. The gendered dimension of these issues tends to be fiercely disputed and has competing understandings in online spaces. This study combined issue network analysis and grounded theory to produce a contextualised exploration of the ways in which sexism was understood in such communities. Analysis of multi-modal data revealed three categories which were strategic in framing this debate including; 1) potential (mis)recognition of such behaviours within these contexts, 2) mistaken emphasis upon the gendered dimension of identity within interactions, and 3) qualification to \\u2018count\\u2019 and be heard on these issues. Online spaces reproduce inequalities that exist offline and owing to the technological affordances and contextual nuances, are also sites of cultural production where relations of gendered power may be configured.

Also debated is whether or not a genuine social movement is emerging, what form it is taking, and if it can be sustained as places like New York, Cleveland, and Baltimore take Ferguson\\u2019s place on the front page. While much of this work assumes the Ferguson Protest Movement and the now more widely known Black Lives Matter movement to be one and the same, a closer look suggests that the Ferguson protestors maintain organizational and political distinctions unique to this particular group and place. With this in mind, it is important to consider two questions.

At a basic level, the exercise reminds us that sport-based activism is not unprecedented and, when it emerges, tends to be connected with the larger social movements of the day (the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s and Black Lives Matter more recently). The comparison also shows contemporary activism to be the biggest and broadest mobilization of African American athletes and their supporters in American history, propelled especially by the participation of women and athletes across multiple sports and levels of participation. However, athletic activism remains as polarizing as ever and the most significant impacts of athletic activism still appear to be primarily symbolic or cultural.

We can embrace the ways the field and each piece of literature simultaneously was and is. Importantly, we can think about what both African American literature and the course on this literature need to be in ways that focus on past, present, and future. For students, African American literature can be a living voice in a broader trajectory of civil and social death, de jure and de facto discrimination, and the struggle for social justice.

Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants.

White supremacists and White nationalists did not hide their racist ideologies as they demanded that their privileged place in history not be erased. The BLM movement, which challenges state-sanctioned anti-Black racism, was ready to confront themes of White discontent and reverse racism, critiques of political correctness, and the assumption that racialized people should know their place and be content to be the subordinate other.It is easy to frame the events in Charlottesville as indicative of US-specific race problems. However, a sense that White spaces should prevail and an ongoing history of anti-Black racism are not unique to the United States. The rise of Canadian activism under the BLM banner also signals a movement to change Canadian forms of institutional racism in policing, education, and the labor market.

This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 9-21 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Community Psychology; Black Lives Matter; diversity; values; intersectional political consciousness; social justice; Philosophy.

This article examines the motivations of participants in these events. Drawing upon data from surveys of protesters outside the 2008 national party conventions, it focuses on how partisan and independent political identifications correspond with the reasons that individuals give for protesting. The results demonstrate that there are some conditions under which independents place a greater focus on issues than do partisans and under which partisans place a greater focus on presidential candidates than do independents. However, there are also conditions under which independents are inclined to work alongside partisans, such as trying to stop the election of a threatening candidate and in championing an issue outside their opposing party\\u2019s convention. The article argues that micro-level partisan identifications are thus likely to affect the broader structure of party coalitions. These considerations promise to become increasingly relevant as social movements \\u2013 such as the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter \\u2013 launch new campaigns against or within established parties.\",\"published_in\":\"Research & Politics, Vol 3 (2016)\",\"year\":\"2016-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Political science; J\",\"subject\":\"Political science; J\",\"authors\":\"Michael T.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement. It also explores the implications of education, engagement, and activism for people of color and libraries today. Design\\\\\\/methodology\\\\\\/approach The authors have engaged the topic from a critical race perspective as a practice in exercising voice \\u2013 telling stories, presenting counterstories, and practicing advocacy (Ladson-Billings, 1998). Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population.

Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life\\u2014the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment\\u2014is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles\\u2014liberation, inspiration, and healing\\u2014to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life. Appealing to the Smithsonian\\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture as an example, this paper articulates the possibilities of architectural projects to symbolically and practically support liberative goals in African American religious systems and political movements.\",\"published_in\":\"Religions, Vol 8, Iss 12, p 256 (2017)\",\"year\":\"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"African American religion; African American spirituality; Black Lives Matter; architecture; built environment; womanist ethics; ecowomanism; liberation theology; social justice; National Museum of African American History and Culture; Religions.

I do so in the context of claims and counter-claims about contemporary transformations in what Rheinhart Kosselleck (2004: 241) terms the \\u2018expected otherness of the future\\u2019. Arguing for changes in the form of the \\u2018expected otherness of the future\\u2019 rather than its simple loss, disappearance or absence, I describe how emergency operates around a temporality of exceptionality, urgency and interval. Formal and informal declarations of emergency are, in addition, imbued with hope: the hope that time remains and action can make a difference to events. What the use of declarations of emergency by Black Lives Matter activists does is disrupt the geo-historically specific divide between the everyday and emergency by naming conditions that mix the endemic and the evental as emergencies. In the spark of hope that is the act of declaring that ongoing conditions should be treated as emergencies, the \\u2018otherness of the future\\u2019 folds into and becomes part of the present.\",\"published_in\":\"Sociological review, 2017, Vol.65(3), pp.463-477 [Peer Reviewed Journal]\",\"year\":\"2017-09-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"emergency futures; exception urgency; futures exception\",\"authors\":\"Anderson, B.\",\"link\":\"http:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/dro.dur.ac.uk\\\\\\/20324\\\\\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f8529f6d014ebb6bd18b76fa0c3dbab11abf32a47ef98b5e1aa325fdffba74bb\",\"relevance\":44},{\"id\":\"f8ff0b276fa231e4ad81597f40fc4fea780f7b7ecedafe4674c0c0e228950d5b\",\"relation\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/southernspaces.org\\\\\\/node\\\\\\/43160; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/toc\\\\\\/1551-2754; 1551-2754; doi:10.18737\\\\\\/M7HC81; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/255c3a8e312c497cbb50b0ce6936a77e\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doi.org\\\\\\/10.18737\\\\\\/M7HC81; https:\\\\\\/\\\\\\/doaj.org\\\\\\/article\\\\\\/255c3a8e312c497cbb50b0ce6936a77e\",\"title\":\"#SAYHERNAME: Towards a Gender Inclusive Movement for Black Lives\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Dr. Brittney Cooper speaks about the experiences of cis and transgender women in the Black Lives Matter movement.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term \\u201cNigerian Lives Matter.\\u201e They appropriated from \\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\\u201e the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans\\u2019 familiarity with America\\u2019s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era.\",\"published_in\":\"Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Abimbola A.

Diverging from the person\\\\\\/who equation, Jacques Derrida conceives the who as an absolute singularity that resists its subjection to the what, and by extension, its reduction to particularity and identity. Expanding beyond Horton\\u2019s racial context, the final section of the essay considers how the contemporary \\u201cBlack Lives Matter\\u201d movement reckons with the problem of particularity and identity while also gesturing toward an incalculable singularity\\u2014infinitely deferred yet always \\u201cpresent.\\u201d. - North American Literature;- Literary Theory;- Expanding Knowledge in Languages; Communication and Culture; Seuss; Dr; Derrida; Jacques; identity (psychology); American literature; history and criticism. .

The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement re-centered and illuminated the disparities facing the Black population as a result of systemic racism in the United States (U.S.). Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination..

For what purpose and under what curricular conditions do we teach racialized \\u201cminority\\u201d repertoires of theatre and performance in Canada?

This article focuses on movements against police brutality in Brazil and their connections with the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, which gained momentum from 2013 to 2016 motivated by videos that exposed police abuse, and sparked a global debate about institutional racism.

International audience ; In this article, my focus is to decipher the context in which Black Lives Matter (BLM) came into existence in the first place as well as its impact throughout its short time of existence. The movement was born from a deep frustration over police brutality under the Obama administration and the feeling that justice was not served in court in spite of unquestionable evidence. What is original is that the rallying cry came from Facebook, leading up to the creation of an international organization. Its platform is much larger than police brutality and includes gay rights, women\\u2019s right, discrimination in various forms and socioeconomic injustices as well ethical\\\\\\/metaphysical concerns. Social movements tend to become less effective when they become institutionalized. While BLM gained the support from some institutions, increasing its political influence, it remains to be seen what directions the movement will take. For now, even though the movement denounces the deep divisions of the nation, it is making strides in society, sparking discussions on its agenda and what it means to be black in many circles. ; Dans cet article, je m\\u2019attelle \\u00e0 d\\u00e9chiffrer le contexte dans lequel le mouvement Black Lives Matter (BLM) est apparu, tout en me penchant sur son impact depuis sa courte existence.

The majority of young people in Africa are today living in waithood, a prolonged, difficult, and dynamic transition into adult life. This experience is shared with an increasing number of young people in the developed North who are also grappling with issues of joblessness and political exclusion. This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people's needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change.

Through a close examination of the Dylan Yang-Isaiah Powell case in Wausau, Wisconsin, we argue that while Hmong experiences may have remained marginalized or invisible in the era of Black Lives Matter, this case and the mobilization efforts around it suggest both commonalities and disjunctures among boys of color, especially in relation to the US justice system. The Dylan Yang case, in which a Hmong teen was convicted of murder for the stabbing of another boy, perceived to be black Latino, in an altercation at his home, demands comparative racialization analytics to gain perspective on the implementation of unequal justice. Unpacking the effects of the gangster stereotype, especially for Southeast Asian youth, we suggest how, despite the Asian American model minority trope, Hmong American boys have been racialized as monstrous thugs comparable (but not identical) to their black and Latino counterparts, and thus treated by law enforcement as suspects in need of \\u201ccataloging\\u201d as part of the school-to-prison pipeline. We also delve into the actual practices of young men in order to reveal their strategies in tense and conflictual multiracial contexts, then turn to issues such as long sentences and juvenile solitary confinement that imply the disposability of young lives of color. We conclude with a curation of links to articles, blogs and social media that we invite readers to explore using the critical lens we provide..

The historical role that the Catholic Church has played in oppressing many different groups is clear: for example, the oppression of women, children, LGBTQ people, and people of Color. Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, \\u201cBlack lives matter!\\u201d This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action.

As a multiracial person committed to racial justice and sympathetic both to those pushing for recognition of multiracial identity and to those who worry such recognition may undermine larger movements, these are questions I have long grappled with both professionally and personally. Of course, multiracial lives matter-but do they constitute a sub-agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement, or is there an independent agenda the moniker \\\"Multiracial Lives Matter\\\" might represent? If the latter, is there a danger that such an agenda might be co-opted by other forces and used to further unintended purposes, such as the advancement of colorblindness?

The article attempts to demonstrate the necessity of acknowledging the body when considering the current Black Lives Matter movement, give an account of Black female and trans erasure, and ultimately (re)affirm the lived embodiment of Black, female, and trans bodies, all through an atheistic lens. Atheism here, while indeed denying the existence of gods, has as its primary concern affirming life. Too often is theology, as theologian Anthony Pinn says, \\u201ca theology of no-body\\u201d; thus atheistic feminist Blackness, as understood here, seeks to entrench the body rather than abstract it. Atheistic feminist Blackness reinscribes and affirms the subjectivity and humanity of Black, female, and trans bodies, countering hegemonic discourse that explicitly and implicitly states otherwise. The article\\u2019s emphasis of an atheistic posture stems from the prescient words of Catherine Keller: \\u201catheist or agnostic feminists ignore the God-word at their own peril.\\u201d Therefore, the Black feminist ideological argument takes the \\u201cGod-word\\u201d seriously, reckons with it, and offers an alternative to a theological tradition that often imbues the body with inherent flaw (sin), abstraction (soul), and erasure of the ontological value of Black, female, and noncisgendered bodies.. atheism; radical feminism; Blackness; embodiment; Black Lives Matter;;  Feminism; .

This paper uses recent instances of police killings of African-American men, and of the retaliatory violence that has flared up in cities across the US (e.g. Ferguson, Baltimore, Baton Rouge), and of the emergence of Black Lives Matters since 2012, as a starting point to think about how well crime fiction can help us to make sense of the larger problem of political violence in the contemporary US. Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley\\u2019s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes\\u2019s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism.

Over the past few years, systemic racism has been increasingly in the news via the work of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context..

Research on collective action frequently characterizes social media as a tool for mobilization. However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group \\u2018allies\\u2019. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.. developing black; functions social; media developing. .

No aesthetic was unaffected by inflections of this new black consciousness.

This study combined issue network analysis and grounded theory to produce a contextualised exploration of the ways in which sexism was understood in such communities. Analysis of multi-modal data revealed three categories which were strategic in framing this debate including; 1) potential (mis)recognition of such behaviours within these contexts, 2) mistaken emphasis upon the gendered dimension of identity within interactions, and 3) qualification to \\u2018count\\u2019 and be heard on these issues.

Also debated is whether or not a genuine social movement is emerging, what form it is taking, and if it can be sustained as places like New York, Cleveland, and Baltimore take Ferguson\\u2019s place on the front page. While much of this work assumes the Ferguson Protest Movement and the now more widely known Black Lives Matter movement to be one and the same, a closer look suggests that the Ferguson protestors maintain organizational and political distinctions unique to this particular group and place. With this in mind, it is important to consider two questions. What was specifically different about the death of Michael Brown and the place in which he lived and died, such that this event sparked sustained protests around the world?

This overview of the 1968 African American Olympic protest movement provides historical context and a comparative touchstone for understanding the current wave of Black athletic activism in the United States. At a basic level, the exercise reminds us that sport-based activism is not unprecedented and, when it emerges, tends to be connected with the larger social movements of the day (the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s and Black Lives Matter more recently). The comparison also shows contemporary activism to be the biggest and broadest mobilization of African American athletes and their supporters in American history, propelled especially by the participation of women and athletes across multiple sports and levels of participation. However, athletic activism remains as polarizing as ever and the most significant impacts of athletic activism still appear to be primarily symbolic or cultural.

Public relations research has gradually incorporated the study of advocacy organizations. However, little research has focused on social movements in particular. Through a content analysis of all public tweets sent by Black Lives Matter (BLM) over a four-year period, this study examined the message strategies used on Twitter by the social movement as a means to share information, build community, and promote action. Consistent with research on other types of organizations, informational messages proved to be the most common. The study also analyzed the influence that these strategies had on audience engagement in terms of replies and retweets.

In theorizing how we should pedagogically approach African American literature, especially in courses for undergraduates, I argue that we have to move away from questions of what was or even what is African American literature and, instead, find ways to teach African American literature in both its historical contexts\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dartistic and political\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dand its contemporary resonances. We can embrace the ways the field and each piece of literature simultaneously was and is. Importantly, we can think about what both African American literature and the course on this literature need to be in ways that focus on past, present, and future. For students, African American literature can be a living voice in a broader trajectory of civil and social death, de jure and de facto discrimination, and the struggle for social justice. Our current moment demands it, and the persistence of the Black Lives Matter movement\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dfrom its origins in the wake of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s deaths into the early stages of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaigns\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dwarrants, or perhaps even necessitates, a pedagogy that positions African American literature courses as spaces on campuses where the vulnerabilities of and violent acts against black lives can be discussed. In this paper, I am particularly interested in examining both the praxis of teaching African American literature as part of a cultural and civic literacy program for our students and then in examining the larger stakes of our moment, both for racism in the United States and the role of literature courses of programs..

This study investigates the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) youth living in Windsor, Ontario regarding their interactions with police. Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society..

White supremacists and White nationalists did not hide their racist ideologies as they demanded that their privileged place in history not be erased. The BLM movement, which challenges state-sanctioned anti-Black racism, was ready to confront themes of White discontent and reverse racism, critiques of political correctness, and the assumption that racialized people should know their place and be content to be the subordinate other.It is easy to frame the events in Charlottesville as indicative of US-specific race problems. However, a sense that White spaces should prevail and an ongoing history of anti-Black racism are not unique to the United States. The rise of Canadian activism under the BLM banner also signals a movement to change Canadian forms of institutional racism in policing, education, and the labor market. This article responds to perceptions that the BLM movement has given insufficient attention to environmental concerns (Pellow 2016; Halpern 2017). Drawing on critical race theory as a conceptual tool, this article focuses on the Canadian context as part of the author\\u2019s argument in favor of greater collaboration between BLM and the environmental justice (EJ) movement in Canada.

The killings of unarmed Black men and women in America at the hands of police officers are a prolific, pervasive, and unjust epidemic.

This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue..

Protests at national party conventions are an important setting in which political parties and social movements challenge one another. This article examines the motivations of participants in these events. Drawing upon data from surveys of protesters outside the 2008 national party conventions, it focuses on how partisan and independent political identifications correspond with the reasons that individuals give for protesting. The results demonstrate that there are some conditions under which independents place a greater focus on issues than do partisans and under which partisans place a greater focus on presidential candidates than do independents. However, there are also conditions under which independents are inclined to work alongside partisans, such as trying to stop the election of a threatening candidate and in championing an issue outside their opposing party\\u2019s convention. The article argues that micro-level partisan identifications are thus likely to affect the broader structure of party coalitions. These considerations promise to become increasingly relevant as social movements \\u2013 such as the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter \\u2013 launch new campaigns against or within established parties..

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine libraries\\u2019 responsibility to engage with and support communities of color as they challenge systemic racism, engage in the political process, and exercise their right to free speech. Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement. It also explores the implications of education, engagement, and activism for people of color and libraries today. Design\\\\\\/methodology\\\\\\/approach The authors have engaged the topic from a critical race perspective as a practice in exercising voice \\u2013 telling stories, presenting counterstories, and practicing advocacy (Ladson-Billings, 1998). Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis.

Notes on Kant\\u2019s anthropology today. My discussion in this essay beings with a short rehearsal of Kant\\u2019s approach to anthropology and history in order to provide the framework for my subsequent focus on the political commentary that has surrounded the Black Lives Matter movement. This movement presents the most recent political challenge to white America\\u2019s belief in the inevitability of progress and I am interested in the light that might be shed on this challenge when viewed through the lens of Enlightenment conceptions of not just history, but cultural and racial fitness for progressive development. I conclude with suggestions for the direction a new political imaginary might take, one capable of acknowledging the real history of race in America even as it makes room for the still necessary role played by our hope for progress, and the possibility of an expanded moral horizon..

The Black Lives Matter movement has become one of the most visible, controversial, and impactful campaigns to address racialized violence and discrimination in the 21st century. Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life\\u2014the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment\\u2014is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles\\u2014liberation, inspiration, and healing\\u2014to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life. Appealing to the Smithsonian\\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture as an example, this paper articulates the possibilities of architectural projects to symbolically and practically support liberative goals in African American religious systems and political movements..

Emergency as a descriptor, technique and legal-political device has become a taken-for-granted way of apprehending and governing events and situations. In this paper, I explore the temporality of emergency, through reflections on the use of declarations of emergency in relation to US-based Black Lives Matter protests. I do so in the context of claims and counter-claims about contemporary transformations in what Rheinhart Kosselleck (2004: 241) terms the \\u2018expected otherness of the future\\u2019. Arguing for changes in the form of the \\u2018expected otherness of the future\\u2019 rather than its simple loss, disappearance or absence, I describe how emergency operates around a temporality of exceptionality, urgency and interval. Formal and informal declarations of emergency are, in addition, imbued with hope: the hope that time remains and action can make a difference to events. What the use of declarations of emergency by Black Lives Matter activists does is disrupt the geo-historically specific divide between the everyday and emergency by naming conditions that mix the endemic and the evental as emergencies. In the spark of hope that is the act of declaring that ongoing conditions should be treated as emergencies, the \\u2018otherness of the future\\u2019 folds into and becomes part of the present.. emergency futures; exception urgency; futures exception.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters. This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term \\u201cNigerian Lives Matter.\\u201e They appropriated from \\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\\u201e the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans\\u2019 familiarity with America\\u2019s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era.. performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H.
