When the corona virus outbreak hit Indonesia, the state of the country was not ready to deal with it, so that a quick reaction to prevention socialization had not yet been carried out by Indonesia. Finally, the spread of the corona virus epidemic is very bad for all Indonesian people, because many Indonesians affected by the transmission of this virus, including the health team, are the main group in handling this virus outbreak. Therefore, the government adopted a policy to provide incentives for health teams that fought against the corona virus to benefit the health team and the general public. The study uses a normative legal method with three approaches namely; statute approach, case approach, and philosophical approach. Data was obtained from government policies on presidential policies, policies of the Governor of DKI Jakarta, and other policies. The results of the study stated that the health team is the main group that fights against the corona virus with a very high risk, so the government needs to provide incentives as an effort to benefit and support the health team in fighting the corona covid-19 virus.Keywords: Covid-19, Policy, Incentives. Abstrak Indonesia merupakan salah satu Negara terserang virus corona yang terjadi pada awal 2020. Pada saat wabah virus corona menimpa Indonesia, keadaan negara belum siap untuk menghadapinya, sehingga reaksi cepat sosialisasi pencegahan belum sempat dilakukan oleh Indonesia. Akhirnya penyebaran wabah virus corona ini menjadi hal yang sangat buruk bagi seluruh masyarakat Indonesia, karena banyak warga Indonesia yang terkena dampak penularan virus ini termasuk para tim kesehatan yang menjadi kelompok utama dalam menangani wabah virus ini. Oleh karenanya, pemerintah mengambil kebijakan untuk memberikan insentif bagi tim kesehatan yang berperang melawan virus corona guna memberikan kemaslahatan bagi tim kesehatan dan masyarakat umum. Penelitian menggunakan metode hukum normatif dengan tiga pendekatan yaitu; statute approach, case approach, dan philosophical approach. Data diperoleh dari kebijakan pemerintah kebijakan presiden, kebijakan gubernur DKI Jakarta, serta kebijakan lainnya.

This is due to the emergence of the Corona virus outbreak, which originated in Wuhan City of China, and spread throughout the world. Initially the government did not follow the method used by several other countries related to information provided about the corona covid-19 virus, namely by conducting a quick reaction of prevention socialization. The reason is so that the Indonesian people are not worried about issues that are worrying, other than to minimize the existence of Hoax news from a handful of irresponsible people. Finally the covid-19 outbreak also became a concern for the community, because many Indonesians were affected by the transmission of this virus. Therefore, the government took the initiative to take a lockdown policy for 14 days to anticipate the transmission of this corona outbreak. The study uses qualitative research methods with a literary and empirical approach. The data obtained comes from several regulations, such as the Governor of DKI Jakarta and several other regulations and policies, as well as phenomena that occur in the field. The results of the study stated that Indonesia had experienced a condition where the community's concern about Covid-19 was quite large, so that a government policy to lockdown was needed, as an effort to break the chain of the spread of the Corona Covid-19 virus.Keywords: Corona Virus, Lock Down, Government Policy AbstrakTahun 2020 merupakan tahun yang mengkhawatirkan seluruh negara, tanpa terkecuali negara Indonesia. Hal itu disebabkan munculkan wabah virus Corona, yang bermula dari Kota Wuhan China, dan menyebar ke seluruh penjuru dunia. Awalnya pemerintah tidak mengikuti cara yang digunakan oleh beberapa negara lainnya terkait informasi yang diberikan mengenai virus corona covid-19, yaitu dengan melakukan reaksi cepat sosialisasi pencegahan. Penyebabnya, agar masyarakat Indonesia tidak khawatir dengan isu yang mengkhawatirkan, selain untuk meminimalisir adanya berita Hoax dari segelintir orang yang tidak bertanggung jawab. Akhirnya wabah covid-19 ini juga menjadi hal yang mengkhawatirkan bagi masyarakat, karena banyak warga Indonesia yang terkena dampak penularan virus ini. Oleh karenanya, pemerintah berinisiatif untuk mengambil kebijakan lockdown selama 14 hari guna mengantisipasi penularan wabah corona ini. Penelitian menggunakan metode penelitian kualitatif dengan pendekatan literatur dan empiris. Data yang didapat berasal dari beberapa Peraturan, seperti Peraturan Gubernur DKI Jakarta dan beberapa peraturan dan kebijakan lainnya, serta fenomena yang terjadi di lapangan.

As a multifaceted phenomenon, corona-virus prevalence is much more significant than other simple medical conditions. It involves several dimensions including dynamism, complicated, extensiveness, variety, and depth. It can accelerate or slow down grand global trends including the impressive trend of smart virtualization by the multinational nongovernmental specialist companies for realization of the global village. Hence, at present, numerous scientific researches regarding various aspects of crisis management, including health and biology, economics, technology, culture and sociology, ethics, spirituality, politics, security, inter nationality and law, as well as the future of corona-virus and the post-corona world are being held on the phenomenon of corona-virus prevalence by universities and scientific centers in the world. These scientific researches and experiments by individuals and institutions, all together, are creating new knowledge in various scientific fields. Therefore, it seems necessary to concentrate on knowledge management in the crisis of corona-virus prevalence. Knowledge offers a firm foundation for intelligent, correct, and timely behavior at individual, group, organizational, national, and global levels. Conscious and systematized reflection on the lessons learned from the corona-virus outbreak, as well as the proper methods discovered, makes it possible for people to take the best advantage from the knowledge they have gained with difficulty. Furthermore, it seems necessary to design and apply the architecture of knowledge gained by the corona-virus prevalence to enable step-by-step processing and knowledge transformation in different fields through an interdisciplinary approach (just as knowledge products are processed), and to ensure that the acquired knowledge is provided to the end-users and are used appropriately. Based on a review and meta-analysis of theoretical literature relating to the main approaches to knowledge management cycles, knowledge management cycle in the corona-virus outbreak crisis can be presented in the following three main stages: 1) Acquisition or creation of the knowledge derived from corona; 2) Targeted distribution or general sharing of knowledge derived from corona; 3) Understanding and applying the knowledge derived from corona.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0645\\u062f\\u06cc\\u0631\\u06cc\\u062a \\u0631\\u0627\\u0647\\u0628\\u0631\\u062f\\u06cc \\u062f\\u0627\\u0646\\u0634 \\u0633\\u0627\\u0632\\u0645\\u0627\\u0646\\u06cc , Vol 3, Iss 8, Pp 1-4 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"knowledge management; knowledge management cycle; coronavirus; Management.

Following up on this, the Indonesian government also stated that the Corona virus problem had become a non-natural national disaster. The President of the Republic of Indonesia and the Regional Government along with their staffs provided each other hand in hand to make some tactical steps as an effort to prevent the spread of Corona Covid-19 Virus in the community. From the ministerial level to the heads of the provinces, regencies and even the municipal government. This research uses content analysis method, where content analysis is limited to newspaper media that deliver information related to some tactical steps taken by each head of government, both in several regions and countries. The purpose of this study is to provide education to the public in facing global disasters and their prevention. The results showed that local governments have done a lot of communication strategies to their respective regional communities through coercive, informative, canalizing, educative, persuasive and redundancy techniques in packaging messages in the form of instructions, appeals to the public to prevent Covid-19 transmission in their respective regions. . However, there is still no coercive technique up to the stage of imposing sanctions for deterrent effects for offenders. The central government also has not yet maximized its role in using a comprehensive communication strategy for all local governments. This is because there is no national command from the central government which is known to be slow in preventing the transmission of Covid-19 which has become a global disaster.Keywords: Tactical Steps, Local Government, Corona Virus Abstrak:Sejak Badan kesehatan Dunia atau WHO telah menyatakan bahwa virus Corona Covid-19 sebagai pandemi. Menindaklanjuti hal tersebut, pemerintah Indonesia juga menyatakan masalah virus Corona sudah menjadi bencana nasional non alam. Presiden Republik Indonesia dan Pemerintah Daerah beserta jajarannya memberikan untuk saling bahu membahu membuat beberapa langkah taktis sebagai upaya pencegahan penyebaran Virus Corona Covid-19 di masyarakat. Dari level menteri sampai kepala daerah Provinsi, Kabupaten bahkan Pemkot. Penelitian Ini menggunakan metode analisis isi, dimana content analisis dibatasi pada media surat kabar yang menyampaikan informasi terkait beberapa langkah taktis yang diambil oleh masing-masing kepala pemerintahan, baik di beberapa daerah maupun negara. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk memberikan edukasi kepada masyarakat dalam menghadapi bencana global dan pencegahannya. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pemerintah daerah telah banyak melakukan stategi komunikasi kepada masyarakat wilayahnya masing-masing melalui teknik koersif, informatif, canalizing, edukatif, persuasif dan redudancy dalam mengemas pesan berupa instruksi, himbauan kepada masyarakat untuk mencegah penularan Covid-19 di wilayahnya masing-masing. Akan tetapi masih belum melakukan teknik koersif sampai pada tahap memberikan sanksi untuk efek jera bagi pelanggarnya. Pemerintah pusat juga belum memaksimalkan perannya dalam menggunakan strategi komunikasi secara komprehensif bagi seluruh pemerintah daerah. Hal ini karena tidak adanya komando nasional dari pemerintah pusat yang dikenal lambat dalam mencegah penularan Covid-19 yang sudah menjadi bencana global.Kata Kunci: Langkah Taktis, Pemerintah Daerah, Virus Corona\",\"published_in\":\"SALAM: Jurnal Sosial dan Budaya Syar-i; Vol 7, No 3 (2020): Special Issue Coronavirus Covid-19; 247-260 ; 2654-9050 ; 2356-1459\",\"year\":\"2020-03-26\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Zahrotunnimah, Zahrotunnimah\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/salam\\/article\\/view\\/15103\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"bad0adc285c252b53f7947e0ec718e697de8252206060de98b1a4e5b94de399c\",\"relevance\":90},{\"id\":\"7ba0554b3100c000c4d25918a88d2b124557c22361fed4c7bfeb4d5def3b856b\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/openjournal.unpam.ac.id\\/index.php\\/Sasindo\\/article\\/view\\/5272\\/3740; http:\\/\\/openjournal.unpam.ac.id\\/index.php\\/Sasindo\\/article\\/view\\/5272; doi:10.32493\\/sasindo.v8i1.1-11\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/openjournal.unpam.ac.id\\/index.php\\/Sasindo\\/article\\/view\\/5272; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.32493\\/sasindo.v8i1.1-11\",\"title\":\"JENIS PARAGRAF DALAM SURAT KABAR ONLINE CNN INDONESIA BERTEMA VIRUS CORONA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis jenis paragraf yang terdapat pada dua surat kabar online CNN Indonesia yang bertema virus corona.

The virus has a characteristic genetic instability means genetic mutations occurs in high rate such a phenomena make the virus replicates with different genetic sequences and spread rapidly therefore, it is not easy to be controlled neither by vaccines nor by drugs. This research looking for methods to fight against corona virus through certain mechanisms that have a relationships with transforming growth factor (TGF-beta). Here comes the idea that if we could control TGF-beta, with which the virus interacts, it would be possible to get over the virus either directly or indirectly and at the same giving a chance for the immune system in terms of humeral and cell mediated immunity of the human body to be active against the disease.

Health authorities have identified many other people with COVID-19 around the world. On 31 March 2020, the virus spread more than 750890 People in the World. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency relating to COVID-19. Since then, this strain has been diagnosed in several residents of world. The CDC have advised that it is likely to spread to more people. COVID-19 has affected at least 213 countries or territories or areas. The first people with COVID-19 had links to an animal and seafood market. This fact suggested that animals initially transmitted the virus to humans. However, people with a more recent diagnosis had no connections with or exposure to the market, confirming that humans can pass the virus to each other. Corona viruses will infect most people at some time during their lifetime. Corona viruses can mutate effectively, which makes them so contagious. Information on the virus is scarce at present. In the past, respiratory conditions that develop from corona viruses, such as SARS and MERS, have spread through close contacts. On 17 February 2020, the Director-General of the WHO presented at a media briefing the following updates on how often the symptoms of COVID-19.However, while some viruses are highly contagious, it is less clear how rapidly corona viruses will spread.

The technique improvement was based on using an elliptic PDE as well as a set of four boundary conditions. The PDE method can generate surfaces of geometries from a small number of parameters. Also, the shape of the surfaces, which is generated by the PDE method, is based on a boundary representation and it can easily be changed since it is described by data distributed around the boundaries. In this study, the shape of the generated PDE-based representation of a corona virus has been sketched by using MATLAB program. The results showed that the PDE method is appropriate for representing the shape of a corona virus. Besides that, the data, concerning the radius and height from the corona virus, are then used to get four equations. These equations can be used for future prediction in modeling COVID-19. In conclusion, the PDE method can produce smooth parametric surface representations of any given shapes of viruses.

COVID-19 is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruse2 (SARAS-CoV-2). Initially, COVID-19 was started in Wuhan, a central china in December, 2019. The CFR (case fatility rate) depend upon the availibity of health care, age and health problem with in the population.On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization temporarily named the new virus as 2019 novel corona virus (2019\\u2010nCoV). The sporadic outbreaks of new types of CoVs remind us that CoVs are severe threat to affect the global public health. According to WHO, 87,137 cases was confirmed across worldwide since the beginning of the epidemic. Out of these, 2977 (3.42%) have been fatal. About 92% (79,968) of the confirmed cases were recorded in China, where almost all the deaths were also recorded (2,873, 96.5%) It is highly likely that new CoVID outbreaks are unavoidable in the future due to changes of the climate, ecology and increased interactions of human with animals. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies and vaccines against COVID-19. At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human corona virus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. There are general methods, which include broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical understanding of individual corona viruses, are used to discover the pontential antiviral treatment of human pathogen corona virus. Antiviral drugs includes Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drug, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.\",\"published_in\":\"International Education and Research Journal; Vol 6, No 3 (2020): (MARCH), INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH JOURNAL ; 2454-9916\",\"year\":\"2020-03-30\",\"subject_orig\":\"COVID-19; CFR; 3 TC; TDF; SARAS-CoV-2\",\"subject\":\" CFR; 3 TC; TDF; SARAS-CoV-2\",\"authors\":\"Bala, Madhu; Bajaj, Anil\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ierj.in\\/journal\\/index.php\\/ierj\\/article\\/view\\/2113\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"bd6f20c2fcea5849d06acbfaeb6ee012601f8f6cafe8320baa3f44215ee61adc\",\"relevance\":68},{\"id\":\"76ccb51aa0c7e8e73d19c4e9ec3303e7580c3a3d614ffdbcd6538a9e2a7353bc\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.folkloredebiyat.org\\/Makaleler\\/1683353739_corona%20yeni5.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1300-7491; doi:10.22559\\/folklor.1325; 1300-7491; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/070e2e05eba94efda25a0f35638ddb4b\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22559\\/folklor.1325; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/070e2e05eba94efda25a0f35638ddb4b\",\"title\":\"Corona And Paul Celan Or Love And Pandemic\\/ Corona ve Paul Celan Ya da A\\u015fk ve Pandemi\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The year 2020 has already taken place in history pages as a year of pandemic in which the coronavirus outbreak has taken millions of lives all over the world. This year also coincides with the 50th anniversary of the death of Paul Celan (1920-1970), one of the well-known poets of the post-war Austrian lyric. Interestingly, Celan named his poem Corona, which he wrote seventy-two years ago. The year 1948 corresponds to three years after the end of the Second World War in world history. In Celan\\u2019s personal history these years coincide with tough times, when he emigrated to Czernowitz, Bucharest and then Vienna after surviving the Nazi death camp where his parents were sacrificed. The friendships that Celan built here with the writers around the literature in Vienna, especially meeting the Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann (1926-1973), constitute a turning point in his life. Two great poets experience passionate love. This poem of Celan carries traces of this stormy love in 1948. The main purpose of this study is to analyze this poem and also to investigate whether there is a relationship between Corona and Celan\\u2019s poem with the same title, which is known as the name of the pandemic virus that has killed millions of people today. In this way, it is aimed to draw attention to both the poetry of the master poet, who entered the 50th year of his death in 2020, and the epidemic of the Corona virus that threatened all humanity.

Our country imposed limited commuting to religious, recreational places and trading centers, closed schools and universities, decreased working hours, and cleaned crowded areas and passageways with disinfectants (subway stations, bus stations, and gas stations). Other efforts include: Establishing outposts in order to identify cases of Corona Virus at City entrances and Telephone screening through 4030\\\"that is a hotline for COVID-19 detection and providing relevant health information1.\\\" Despite the necessary precautions taken, there were problems in fighting the Corona Disease, the most important of which include: Insufficiency regarding personal protective equipment like masks, disinfectants and hospital gowns,3 Inadequate number of hospital beds and equipment in some of the cities and shortage of health workers. This issue has caused a high concern in the society and amongst the health workers who take care of Corona virus cases in hospitals. Also, due to the experienced mental disorders of the health care workers while COVID-19 outbreak,4 the role of such shortages in the fight against this disease is crucial. In a situation like this where the number of infected people shoots up, hygienic needs of Iran increases, too. A new trend in fighting the disease has begun. In this trend, different groups of people like clerics and cleric students, Basij, medical and non-medical students have taken measures in fighting the Corona Virus which are in line with the World health organization and Ministry of Health and Medical Education standards. These measures are taken in 4 general areas, including: 1. disinfecting the pssageways (Streets, Alleys), highly populated areas (Trading Centers, Bus and Subway stations, Gas stations) and vehicles, 2. producing personal protective equipment (Masks, face shields, gowns and disinfectants), 3. helping with the Telephone Screening by Medical students, and 4. Volunteer medical students participation in health care centers and hospitals. Now, despite the exigent circumstances regarding the spread of COVID-19 worldwide, volunteer measures and organized activities in Iran have led to provision of telephone screening information and details about the COVID-19 to more than 65 million people until March 31, 2020;5 and production of thousands of hygienic products daily has had a significant role in controlling and fighting the Corona Virus Pandemic. Although in the early period of the virus outbreak, Iran was the third country to have the most cases of Corona positive cases after China and Korea until 2nd of March, and the number of identified cases increased in April 15, 2020 which might be due to the efficient and comprehensive screening process, it became the 8th country with the most positive cases of Corona after the United States, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, England, and China.2 It is also expected that with adequate health equipment, specialized human resources and provision of scientific information to the community, the public and health workers who take care of Corona virus cases will have tranquility. Therefore, Iran\\u2019s approach towards facing the COVID-19 clearly states the fact that national approach in fighting the Corona Virus is an important factor among other measures taken and it is mentioned as a modern approach in managing a health crisis in a large scale.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery, Vol 8, Iss 3, Pp 275-276 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"covid-19; iran; national approach; Medicine; R; Nursing; RT1-120\",\"subject\":\"covid- iran; national approach; Medicine; R; Nursing; \",\"authors\":\"Tayebe Pourghaznein; Sina Salati\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.30476\\/ijcbnm.2020.85928.1308\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"aaab1362e291b767514658499da220532bdb4142ed2fc81a1e295715a635085c\",\"relevance\":65},{\"id\":\"2756557b23ebc68bc67cfe5ca1e02da85ae37bbb8863804b9c12ddb761787c01\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/salam\\/article\\/view\\/15104\\/pdf; http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/salam\\/article\\/view\\/15104; doi:10.15408\\/sjsbs.v7i3.15104\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/salam\\/article\\/view\\/15104; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15408\\/sjsbs.v7i3.15104\",\"title\":\"Impact of Corona Virus Outbreak Towards Teaching and Learning Activities in Indonesia\",\"paper_abstract\":\"AbstractLately, the world community was shocked by the Coronavirus outbreak that originated in the city of Wuhan, China that occurred in November 2019 last year.

Generally, infection caused by Corona viruses progresses asymptomatically in healthy children and rarely causes morbidity and mortality. Despite this fact, the infection may cause a severe clinical picture in the elderly and adults and children with predisposing underlying disease. The novel Corona virus outbreak, which started in China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over the world and turned into a pandemic. This pandemic, named as COVID-19 by WHO (World Health Organisation), caused economic and social losses all over the world and caused more than 450,000 deaths worldwide up to 21 June. COVID-19, whose specific antiviral therapy and preventive vaccine is not yet available, is still the most serious health problem in the world.Keywords: Coronaviruses, Pandemic, Pediatrics, Children\",\"published_in\":\"Volume: 3, Issue: \\u00d6zel Say\\u0131 140-148 ; 2651-4184 ; Medical Research Reports\",\"year\":\"2020-08-05T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"COVID-19,Pandemi,Pediyatri,\\u00c7ocuk\",\"subject\":\"COVID-Pandemi,Pediyatri,\\u00c7ocuk\",\"authors\":\"\\u00c7\\u0130FT\\u00c7\\u0130, Mustafa\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/mrr\\/issue\\/56260\\/756578\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"6cbd9683bb970d9df6a3acb7696a4a09753a689cf07fe1c58362c188077d5f47\",\"relevance\":58},{\"id\":\"d0dc3fceb175672c875b575e97e5f44bf7a002938ede0d9739cd780cb02f7231\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.sbmu.ac.ir\\/en-jhf\\/article\\/view\\/30950\\/19999; http:\\/\\/journals.sbmu.ac.ir\\/en-jhf\\/article\\/view\\/30950\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.sbmu.ac.ir\\/en-jhf\\/article\\/view\\/30950\",\"title\":\"Criteria to evaluate the communities\\u2019 plan and action against the corona virus\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Talking about evaluation of countries and communities\\u2019 responses to corona virus needs specific criteria; some of them are discussed in this manuscript as below: 1-Population: Count and structure of population affect the outcome of COVID-19 management, the elder population are more prone to mortality and morbidity from corona virus. 2-The Economic, Political and Social structure of the country: Given the experience gained, this is probably the most effective component on the outcome of Corona pandemic. 3-Solidarity and integrated managerial system coupled with people-centered politics are another issues that should be taken into more consideration in any evaluation process. Communities such as China, eastern and south-eastern countries which received orders and executions from one source were more successful. At the same time, communities such as England and the United States have suffered partly due to their unintegrated domestic policy. Despite the delay, thanks to the presence of a unified leadership and coherent management as well as community participation, our country was among the successful communities. 4-Structure of Health Delivery System (HDS): Universal coverage is an indicator to evaluate HDS. The more public health coverage, the more successful would be the plan. Iran, Scandinavian communities and Southeast Asian countries with their good universal coverage were more successful than western countries. It is worth noting here that England is an exceptional country owing to its good universal coverage based on leveling of services, referral system; however, its success was affected by its economic and political status as well as financial payments index which has been mainly defined for medical services. 5-Health Facilities: Efficacy of this item was under controlled by national economic and political managerial system and universal health coverage at health delivery system. The United States, for example, reveals 2 to 3 times as many manpower and hospital beds and equipment as many eastern and western communities. However, the public suffered from COVID-19 due to the poor socio-economic structure. Conflicts in providing these facilities further tarnished the image of the West. Iran otherwise of US sanctions did a good job regarding producing health facilities and even could exporte them. 6- Knowledge responding to corona virus: The experience and knowledge of responding to COVID-19 were distributed fast all over the globe and used by health providers; however, MOLECULLAR CELULLAR and DIGITAL sciences made difference among the countries. All of the successful countries such as china, Singapore, south chorea, Nippon benefited from these sciences, to build up the diagnostic facilities and detection of affected cases and thus responding fast to them. Iran was somewhat successful in molecular-cellular science; however, showed weak and dependent in digital science demonstrating needs to work more seriously in these fields not only in responding corona crisis but as a developmental knowledge, which is hoped to be considered by policymakers and managers in the future.

For most ordinary people in the Philippines, the corona virus that caused Corona Virus Disease in December 2019 (COVID 19) was not of big importance. The Philippine government was just observing the usual measure such as installing thermal screening in the airports to detect arriving passengers with flu. The virus continued to spread to the whole world. The continuous spread of the virus is the reason why mass media in print, in television, and other forms were used to educate people on how to prevent the spread of the virus. The Philippines positive cases were increasing almost exponentially. The Philippines government was getting more serious on the corona virus problem. President Rodrigo Duterte announced in the evening of March 12, 2020 of the month-long lock down of the whole Metro Manila from March 15 to April 14, 2020 as the country looks forward to contain the COVID 19. Land, domestic air and domestic sea to and from Metro Manila were suspended within the period. Social and religious activities that involved mass gathering were banned. Conferences, seminars and like activities were postponed and people were advised to stay at home. The lock down has brought about both negative and positive things to the government and to the people which can be observed commonly in every place. The negative things could fall into economic, social and psychological aspects. If corona virus brings negative and undesirable things in the community and in the Philippines, there are also positive things that sprouted. It is true indeed that a misfortune or a disaster to a place or persons can be an opportunity to others. Lots of things which are favorable and beneficial to many people and to the nature during the lock down which include economic, social and ecological aspects. The current situation brought by the corona virus that resulted to lock down implemented by the government of the Philippines gives an opportunity to learn the value of compassion and empathy in times of crisis. COVID 19 is bad, but people can also see the good effect of it.

An Algorithm for Its Application\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the corona virus disease-19 which is accompanied by severe pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar collapses and which stops oxygen exchange. Viral transmissibility and pathogenesis depend on recognition by a receptor in the host, protease cleavage of the host membrane and fusion. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor. Here, we discuss the general characteristics of the virus, its mechanism of action and the way in which the mechanism correlates with the comorbidities that increase the death rate. We also discuss the currently proposed therapeutic measures and propose the use of antioxidant drugs to help patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Oxidizing agents come from phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils that invade tissue. Free radicals promote cytotoxicity thus injuring cells. They also trigger the mechanism of inflammation by mediating the activation of NFkB and inducing the transcription of cytokine production genes. Release of cytokines enhances the inflammatory response. Oxidative stress is elevated during critical illnesses and contributes to organ failure. In corona virus disease-19 there is an intense inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm that could be mediated by oxidative stress. Although antioxidant therapy has not been tested in corona virus disease-19, the consequences of antioxidant therapy in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are known. It improves oxygenation rates, glutathione levels and strengthens the immune response. It reduces mechanical ventilation time, the length of stay in the intensive care unit, multiple organ dysfunctions and the length of stay in the hospital and mortality rates in acute lung injury\\/acute respiratory distress syndrome and could thus help patients with corona virus disease-19.\",\"published_in\":\"Medicina, Vol 56, Iss 386, p 386 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"COVID-19; antioxidant therapy; ACE2 receptor; sepsis; SARS-CoV-2; Medicine (General); R5-920\",\"subject\":\" antioxidant therapy; ACE2 receptor; sepsis; SARS-CoV-2; \",\"authors\":\"Mar\\u00eda Elena Soto; Ver\\u00f3nica Guarner-Lans; Elizabeth Soria-Castro; Linaloe Manzano Pech; Israel P\\u00e9rez-Torres\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/medicina56080386\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"2f9bdde87f02733d1624ba84150773fb3494599b7675fc7e68880d0d6d1e5b43\",\"relevance\":54},{\"id\":\"b87d64bb9cc2d71c1450ee141ba23a519ebd21af4c363cc60b9837b829c1eedd\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.3760545; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/communities\\/mat-journals; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3760546; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3760546; oai:zenodo.org:3760546\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3760546; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3760546\",\"title\":\"Coronavirus Pandemic: An Indian Perspective\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The world is not the same after it has been affected by the corona virus pandemic.

Some of the frequently asked queries include: if they would develop health problems like high blood pressure and\\/or diabetes; if they would have a normal delivery or would require an intervention in the form of cesarean section or instrumentation, if they would have the birth experience as they envision and if the stress is harmful during the ongoing pregnancy. Every pregnant woman strives her best to give birth to a healthy child. As every pregnancy is a period of uncertainties and risks, pregnant women are anxious about their well-being and that of their baby. The list of concerns is endless with the addition of corona virus disease (COVID-19). If we look back into the past, viral infections such as influenza, H1N1, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused immense maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy. Due to compromised, pregnant women are more vulnerable to being infected. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of corona virus that is similar to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). These viruses spread primarily by coughing and sneezing or direct contact. Most patients infected with any one of these three strains of corona virus may remain asymptomatic or may develop relatively mild symptoms such as fever, cough and fatigue. However, some may develop severe forms of the disease leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure; requiring oxygen or other respiratory support. Pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV were at high risk of developing severe pneumonia; heart failure and other complications which could be life-threatening leading to death in many cases.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Lumbini Medical College, Vol 8, Iss 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"COVID-19; Pregnancy; Nepal; SARS-CoV-2; Medicine (General); R5-920\",\"subject\":\" Pregnancy; Nepal; SARS-CoV-2; \",\"authors\":\"Arati Shrestha; Shreyashi Aryal; Deepak Shrestha\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22502\\/jlmc.v8i1.381\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"450ce977b551749acbcac75662415b32352cdb6e69ac03bbb7ff4bce85351a7d\",\"relevance\":27},{\"id\":\"550620afe5fa1ccbe6f1c9fab25743b428093f1fcff730f538abcde241a1550e\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/1120109; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/anadoluklin\\/issue\\/53241\\/738020; doi:10.21673\\/anadoluklin.738020\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/anadoluklin\\/issue\\/53241\\/738020; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21673\\/anadoluklin.738020\",\"title\":\"Covid-19 Pandemisi ve N\\u00f6rolojik Tutulumlar ; Covid-19 Pandemic and Neurological Manifestations\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\u00c7in\\u2019in Wuhan eyaletinde Aral\\u0131k ay\\u0131nda ba\\u015flayan yeni bir korona vir\\u00fcs salg\\u0131n\\u0131 (Corona vir\\u00fcs hastal\\u0131\\u011f\\u0131-2019, Covid-19) do\\u011fruland\\u0131 ve vir\\u00fcs t\\u00fcm D\\u00fcnya\\u2019ya yay\\u0131larak g\\u00fc\\u00e7l\\u00fc ve ciddi bir pandemi olu\\u015fturdu.

The purpose of this paper is to take a comprehensive but critical look at popular indicators in understanding and management of corona virus pandemic, followed by suggesting few key indicators which should be utilized for monitoring the performance of a health system in tackling COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Various variables and indicators related to the disease have been reviewed. Variables and indicators have been categorized and their application has been discussed. Finally, the best variables and indicators have been argued as useful for monitoring the performance of a health system. Results: Closed Case Daily Death Rate and Daily Death to New Patients in the past 14 days rate seem to be more sensitive indicators to show the performance of health systems. Conclusion: Collecting good data to produce appropriate indicators and their subsequent use for policy making as well as adapting strategies to new patters depicted through data analysis, is an important factor in the success of managing Corona virus epidemic.

To explain the disease, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is described. World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus Corona (Covid-19) and declared that this virus spreads from one human to another by contamination and due to this tendency, it is spreading quickly in the country and all over the world. WHO also declared this virus an epidemic and total of 3,106,700 patient records, 214,645 deaths, and 944,593 recovered across the world due to this epidemic. Patients over 70 years of age are more at risk from COVID-19 compared with patients under 70 years of age. The virus curve of onset of symptoms peaked around in April. In this article the symptoms, preventions, treatment, and statics have been discussed. The real cause of the origin of this virus (Covid-19) is still unconfirmed. Although the fatality rates of COVID-19 are very less (about 2.67%) in total infected cases, if compared with SARS and MERS as early known viruses, but the area of spread and number of infected people with this virus is very high than other. In the past, successful vaccines and medications have overcome many disease threats like SARS and MERS. To fight this epidemic virus called Coronavirus (Covid-19), equally effective vaccines and beneficial medicines are required as soon as possible.\",\"published_in\":\"Recent Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research; Vol 2, No 2 (2020); 15-18\",\"year\":\"2020-05-22\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Kumar, Gaurav; Kumar, Mukesh; Gupta, Mansi\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/matjournals.in\\/index.php\\/RTPScR\\/article\\/view\\/5147\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"08f192d5ca61c1ea383db83927c2ee8adfb5c677c3344e70b9d36504d9f120a8\",\"relevance\":22},{\"id\":\"1052b7642e0587e386ad47c3251d5162be412c1b55d59299bedd1c9450337707\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/adalah\\/article\\/view\\/15448\\/7222; http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/adalah\\/article\\/view\\/15448; doi:10.15408\\/adalah.v4i1.15448\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/adalah\\/article\\/view\\/15448; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15408\\/adalah.v4i1.15448\",\"title\":\"Adakah Peluang Bisnis di Tengah Kelesuan Perekonomian Akibat Pandemi Corona?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"AbstractThe corona pandemic has paralyzed the joints of the economy.

Digital transformation in education and online education started to be brought to the fore more, especially due to the effects of Corona Virus (COVID-19), which appeared in Wuhan, China in 2019, on education\\/training areas. Within this framework, since 15 March 2020, because of the epidemic of Corona virus, distance education (Online education, E-learning) has become a very popular subject due to the interruption of face-to-face education and training at universities with schools affiliated to the Ministry of Education. In this period, rather than whether students are ready for online learning, investments have been made in distance education technologies on the assumption that students\\/teachers have positive attitudes and technical capacity to distance education. The main purpose of this study is; before distance education begins at Pamukkale University, it is to analyze the readiness of students for distance education with the Hung (2010) Online Learning Readiness scale. Results show that students had readiness for online learning but found themselves insufficient in terms of online learning control, and readiness for online learning differs according to undergraduate students&#039; classes and whether they already have experience in online learning or not.\",\"published_in\":\"Volume: 11, Issue: 1 5-22 ; 1309-8810 ; Journal of Internet Applications and Management\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Uzaktan E\\u011fitim,\\u00c7evrimi\\u00e7i E\\u011fitim,\\u00c7evrimi\\u00e7i Haz\\u0131r Bulunu\\u015fluluk,Pandemi,Corona Vir\\u00fcs,COVID19; Distance Education,Online Education,Readiness for Online Learning,Pandemic,Corona Virus,COVID19\",\"subject\":\"Uzaktan E\\u011fitim,\\u00c7evrimi\\u00e7i E\\u011fitim,\\u00c7evrimi\\u00e7i Haz\\u0131r Bulunu\\u015fluluk,Pandemi,Corona Vir\\u00fcs,COVID Distance Education,Online Education,Readiness for Online Learning,Pandemic,Corona Virus,COVID19\",\"authors\":\"SARITA\\u015e, Emel; BARUT\\u00c7U, S\\u00fcleyman\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/iuyd\\/issue\\/54593\\/706397\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"5054c125c664ce8671fe67eacd8ff66fc74244daf838047c14e20ea4c24c6bc7\",\"relevance\":6},{\"id\":\"e361529d13843612757a2dffadb9366fb381304665d381ba745205fe9d768923\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.una.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jurti\\/article\\/view\\/1212\\/1095; http:\\/\\/jurnal.una.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jurti\\/article\\/downloadSuppFile\\/1212\\/38; http:\\/\\/jurnal.una.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jurti\\/article\\/view\\/1212; doi:10.36294\\/jurti.v4i1.1212\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.una.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jurti\\/article\\/view\\/1212; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.36294\\/jurti.v4i1.1212\",\"title\":\"IMPLEMENTASI METODE FORWARD CHAINING UNTUK DIAGNOSA PENYAKIT COVID 19 DI RSUD BERKAH PANDEGLANG BANTEN\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract - In 2020 there was an explosion of viruses that shocked the world, that we call Corona Virus Disease 2019. This virus is the development of the Mers virus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus). COVID-9 can spread quickly compared to the Mers virus. The problem in Pandeglang Regency is the lack of medical personnel and medical devices. This is because Pandeglang Regency is an underdeveloped region among other regencies in Banten Province. Therefore, this research is intended to be able to help check patients who have positive Covid-19. The method used is the forward chaining method which is considered simple but easy to be understood. This method uses a continuous trace system that will detect every symptom experienced by the patient. The data used in the form of a questionnaire the results of interviews with experts in their fields. This research is expected to be able to contribute to Pandeglang Regency and break the chain of the spread of Covid-19 in underdeveloped regions that are difficult to get medical personnel and adequate equipment. The conclusion of this research is the forward chaining method can solve this problem.Keywords \\u2013 Implementation, Forward Chaining Method, Covid-19, Berkah Pandeglang District Hospital (RSUD Berkah Pandeglang) Abstrak \\u2013 Pada tahun 2020 terjadi begitu maraknya virus yang menggemparkan dunia yaitu Coronavirus Disease 2019. Virus ini merupakan pengembangan dari virus MERS (middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus). Covid-9 dapat menularkan dengan cepat dibandingkan virus Mers. Permasalahan yang ada di Kabupaten Pandeglang yaitu kurangnya tenaga medis dan alat kesehatan. Hal ini dikarenakan Kabupten Pandeglang merupakan daerah tertinggal di antara kabupaten lainnya yang ada di Provinsi Banten. Maka dari itu, penelitian ini ditujukan untuk dapat membantu pengecekan pasien yang terjangkit positif Covid-19. Adapun metode yang digunakan adalah metode forward chaining yang dianggap sederhana namun mudah untuk dipahami. Metode ini menggunakan system runut maju yang akan mendeteksi setiap gejala yang dialami pasien. Data yang digunakan yaitu berupa kuesioner hasil wawancara dengan para pakar dibidangnya.

Jumlah kasus positif COVID-19 terus meningkat secara signifikan dan menyebar secara cepat di seluruh provinsi di Indonesia. Virus Corona memang dapat menginfeksi siapa saja namun beberapa kelompok orang memiliki tingkat risiko yang lebih tinggi untuk terkena Virus Corona hingga bisa membawa kepada kematian. Untuk itu studi ini berupaya mencari kelompok rentan terinfeksi Virus Corona dengan metode Discourse Network Analysis dengan data berbagai artikel kesehatan di media online.

When the corona virus outbreak hit Indonesia, the state of the country was not ready to deal with it, so that a quick reaction to prevention socialization had not yet been carried out by Indonesia. Finally, the spread of the corona virus epidemic is very bad for all Indonesian people, because many Indonesians affected by the transmission of this virus, including the health team, are the main group in handling this virus outbreak. Therefore, the government adopted a policy to provide incentives for health teams that fought against the corona virus to benefit the health team and the general public. The study uses a normative legal method with three approaches namely; statute approach, case approach, and philosophical approach. Data was obtained from government policies on presidential policies, policies of the Governor of DKI Jakarta, and other policies. The results of the study stated that the health team is the main group that fights against the corona virus with a very high risk, so the government needs to provide incentives as an effort to benefit and support the health team in fighting the corona covid-19 virus.Keywords: Covid-19, Policy, Incentives.

Corona virus is one of the health problems that really needs our attention now. Because this virus can cause death, and the way the virus is transmitted is very easy and fast. There are many things that can be done to reduce the spread of this virus to the territory of Indonesia, one of which is to identify the body temperature of each passenger on international arrivals at the airport. At the airport the identification of this virus is done by using Artificial Intelligence. One of the things that is the goal of developing artificial intelligence (AI) is to help humans. This often means imitating the abilities and intelligence of the person he is trying to help or replace. The tool used is the Thermal Scanner Camera that can see directly the body temperature of the passenger.

As a multifaceted phenomenon, corona-virus prevalence is much more significant than other simple medical conditions. It involves several dimensions including dynamism, complicated, extensiveness, variety, and depth. It can accelerate or slow down grand global trends including the impressive trend of smart virtualization by the multinational nongovernmental specialist companies for realization of the global village. Hence, at present, numerous scientific researches regarding various aspects of crisis management, including health and biology, economics, technology, culture and sociology, ethics, spirituality, politics, security, inter nationality and law, as well as the future of corona-virus and the post-corona world are being held on the phenomenon of corona-virus prevalence by universities and scientific centers in the world. These scientific researches and experiments by individuals and institutions, all together, are creating new knowledge in various scientific fields. Therefore, it seems necessary to concentrate on knowledge management in the crisis of corona-virus prevalence. Knowledge offers a firm foundation for intelligent, correct, and timely behavior at individual, group, organizational, national, and global levels. Conscious and systematized reflection on the lessons learned from the corona-virus outbreak, as well as the proper methods discovered, makes it possible for people to take the best advantage from the knowledge they have gained with difficulty. Furthermore, it seems necessary to design and apply the architecture of knowledge gained by the corona-virus prevalence to enable step-by-step processing and knowledge transformation in different fields through an interdisciplinary approach (just as knowledge products are processed), and to ensure that the acquired knowledge is provided to the end-users and are used appropriately. Based on a review and meta-analysis of theoretical literature relating to the main approaches to knowledge management cycles, knowledge management cycle in the corona-virus outbreak crisis can be presented in the following three main stages: 1) Acquisition or creation of the knowledge derived from corona; 2) Targeted distribution or general sharing of knowledge derived from corona; 3) Understanding and applying the knowledge derived from corona. knowledge management; knowledge management cycle; coronavirus; Management.

Virus Corona adalah virus yang menyerang sistem pernafasan yang bisa menyebabkan gangguan pernafasan, pneumonia akut, sampai kematian. Infeksi virus ini disebut COVID-19 dan pertama kali ditemukan di kota Wuhan, Tiongkok, pada akhir Desember 2019. Virus ini menular dengan cepat dan telah menyebar ke wilayah lain di Tiongkok dan ke beberapa negara termasuk Indonesia. Pada tanggal 2 Maret 2020, Presiden Republik Indonesia, Joko Widodo resmi mengumumkan bahwa ada dua WNI yang positif COVID-19. Informasi ini pun resmi diberitakan oleh berbagai media massa khususnya televisi dengan angle yang beragam. Sebagai saluran berbasis audio-visual, televisi masih diangggap alat yang ampuh untuk membentuk opini publik. Dengan menggunakan pendekatan Analisis Framing Zhongdang Pan dan Gerald M.Kosicki, identifikasi tentang penggunaan televisi untuk kepentingan publik diklasifikasikan dengan melakukan analisis empat struktur framing besar yaitu sintaksis, skrip, tematik, dan retoris. Dari analisis tersebut ditemukan perbedaan framing dalam konten pemberitaan yang disiarkan oleh 2 televisi swasta yang ada di Indonesia, TV One dan Kompas TV. TV One membingkai pemberitaan virus Corona dengan mengedepankan kepanikan dan ketakutan, sedangkan Kompas TV lebih fokus kepada upaya penanganan dan solusi pencegahan.

A total of six species have been identified to cause disease in humans. They are known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems. The past few decades have seen endemic outbreaks in the form of Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus (SARS-CoV). Yet again, we see the emergence of another outbreak due to a new strain called the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The most recent outbreak initially presented as pneumonia of unknown aetiology in a cluster of patients in Wuhan, China. The epicentre of infection was linked to seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets in the city. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has resulted in a rapid pandemic of COVID-19. As the number of cases continues to rise, it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health. This review will introduce a general overview of corona virus and describe the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients.

The results showed that local governments have done a lot of communication strategies to their respective regional communities through coercive, informative, canalizing, educative, persuasive and redundancy techniques in packaging messages in the form of instructions, appeals to the public to prevent Covid-19 transmission in their respective regions. . However, there is still no coercive technique up to the stage of imposing sanctions for deterrent effects for offenders. The central government also has not yet maximized its role in using a comprehensive communication strategy for all local governments.

In the middle of the COvid-19 Pandemic, in addition to social distancing, the government is intensively preventing the spread of the corona virus, as we know that the corona virus is a very scary virus for many people. The virus has spread more and more every day and the way it is spread is very easy and can attack anyone and does not thicken the ages ranging from toddlers to the elderly can be exposed to this Covid-19 virus. Although this virus has a relatively low mortality rate. But who would have thought the spread was faster than other viruses. Until now the world is still racing to find a cure for this corona virus. Therefore, the government issued a policy so that it could immediately break the chain of the spread of the virus by means of large-scale social restrictions. And when large-scale social restrictions are implemented in an area to stop the spread of the corona virus (Covid-19), all activities are restricted. The enactment of large-scale social restrictions aims to fulfill the criteria for disease situations in the form of a significant increase in the number of cases and \\/ or deaths from disease, rapid spread of cases to several regions, and there are epidemiological links with similar events in other regions or countries.

This study uses a descriptive qualitative method by using data related to the use of face or mouth coverings (masks) when carrying out the prayers that are affirmed as understood from the prohibition of the Prophet. The results of this study indicate that the law of origin using the mouth cover (mask) when prayer is makruh tanzih or makruh which does not cancel the prayer. However, in certain conditions such as the existence of intent, then using a legal mask may. It could even be increased to the law recommended if a person who will attend congregational prayers in unhealthy conditions such as fever, cough or flu.

Health authorities have identified many other people with COVID-19 around the world. On 31 March 2020, the virus spread more than 750890 People in the World. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency relating to COVID-19. Since then, this strain has been diagnosed in several residents of world. The CDC have advised that it is likely to spread to more people. COVID-19 has affected at least 213 countries or territories or areas. The first people with COVID-19 had links to an animal and seafood market. This fact suggested that animals initially transmitted the virus to humans. However, people with a more recent diagnosis had no connections with or exposure to the market, confirming that humans can pass the virus to each other. Corona viruses will infect most people at some time during their lifetime. Corona viruses can mutate effectively, which makes them so contagious. Information on the virus is scarce at present. In the past, respiratory conditions that develop from corona viruses, such as SARS and MERS, have spread through close contacts. On 17 February 2020, the Director-General of the WHO presented at a media briefing the following updates on how often the symptoms of COVID-19.However, while some viruses are highly contagious, it is less clear how rapidly corona viruses will spread. Symptoms vary from person-to-person with COVID-19. It may produce few or no symptoms. However, it can also lead to severe illness and may be fatal.

The technique improvement was based on using an elliptic PDE as well as a set of four boundary conditions. The PDE method can generate surfaces of geometries from a small number of parameters. Also, the shape of the surfaces, which is generated by the PDE method, is based on a boundary representation and it can easily be changed since it is described by data distributed around the boundaries. In this study, the shape of the generated PDE-based representation of a corona virus has been sketched by using MATLAB program. The results showed that the PDE method is appropriate for representing the shape of a corona virus. Besides that, the data, concerning the radius and height from the corona virus, are then used to get four equations. These equations can be used for future prediction in modeling COVID-19. In conclusion, the PDE method can produce smooth parametric surface representations of any given shapes of viruses.

COVID-19 is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruse2 (SARAS-CoV-2). Initially, COVID-19 was started in Wuhan, a central china in December, 2019. The CFR (case fatility rate) depend upon the availibity of health care, age and health problem with in the population.On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization temporarily named the new virus as 2019 novel corona virus (2019\\u2010nCoV). The sporadic outbreaks of new types of CoVs remind us that CoVs are severe threat to affect the global public health. According to WHO, 87,137 cases was confirmed across worldwide since the beginning of the epidemic. Out of these, 2977 (3.42%) have been fatal. About 92% (79,968) of the confirmed cases were recorded in China, where almost all the deaths were also recorded (2,873, 96.5%) It is highly likely that new CoVID outbreaks are unavoidable in the future due to changes of the climate, ecology and increased interactions of human with animals. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies and vaccines against COVID-19. At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human corona virus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. There are general methods, which include broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical understanding of individual corona viruses, are used to discover the pontential antiviral treatment of human pathogen corona virus. Antiviral drugs includes Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drug, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV.

Other efforts include: Establishing outposts in order to identify cases of Corona Virus at City entrances and Telephone screening through 4030\\\"that is a hotline for COVID-19 detection and providing relevant health information1.\\\" Despite the necessary precautions taken, there were problems in fighting the Corona Disease, the most important of which include: Insufficiency regarding personal protective equipment like masks, disinfectants and hospital gowns,3 Inadequate number of hospital beds and equipment in some of the cities and shortage of health workers. This issue has caused a high concern in the society and amongst the health workers who take care of Corona virus cases in hospitals. Also, due to the experienced mental disorders of the health care workers while COVID-19 outbreak,4 the role of such shortages in the fight against this disease is crucial. In a situation like this where the number of infected people shoots up, hygienic needs of Iran increases, too. A new trend in fighting the disease has begun. In this trend, different groups of people like clerics and cleric students, Basij, medical and non-medical students have taken measures in fighting the Corona Virus which are in line with the World health organization and Ministry of Health and Medical Education standards. These measures are taken in 4 general areas, including: 1. disinfecting the pssageways (Streets, Alleys), highly populated areas (Trading Centers, Bus and Subway stations, Gas stations) and vehicles, 2. producing personal protective equipment (Masks, face shields, gowns and disinfectants), 3. helping with the Telephone Screening by Medical students, and 4. Volunteer medical students participation in health care centers and hospitals. Now, despite the exigent circumstances regarding the spread of COVID-19 worldwide, volunteer measures and organized activities in Iran have led to provision of telephone screening information and details about the COVID-19 to more than 65 million people until March 31, 2020;5 and production of thousands of hygienic products daily has had a significant role in controlling and fighting the Corona Virus Pandemic. Although in the early period of the virus outbreak, Iran was the third country to have the most cases of Corona positive cases after China and Korea until 2nd of March, and the number of identified cases increased in April 15, 2020 which might be due to the efficient and comprehensive screening process, it became the 8th country with the most positive cases of Corona after the United States, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, England, and China.2 It is also expected that with adequate health equipment, specialized human resources and provision of scientific information to the community, the public and health workers who take care of Corona virus cases will have tranquility. Therefore, Iran\\u2019s approach towards facing the COVID-19 clearly states the fact that national approach in fighting the Corona Virus is an important factor among other measures taken and it is mentioned as a modern approach in managing a health crisis in a large scale. covid-19; iran; national approach; Medicine; R; Nursing; RT1-120 International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery, Vol 8, Iss 3, Pp 275-276 (2020) Tayebe Pourghaznein; Sina Salati\"},{\"id\":\"2756557b23ebc68bc67cfe5ca1e02da85ae37bbb8863804b9c12ddb761787c01\",\"content\":\"Impact of Corona Virus Outbreak Towards Teaching and Learning Activities in Indonesia AbstractLately, the world community was shocked by the Coronavirus outbreak that originated in the city of Wuhan, China that occurred in November 2019 last year.

Generally, infection caused by Corona viruses progresses asymptomatically in healthy children and rarely causes morbidity and mortality. Despite this fact, the infection may cause a severe clinical picture in the elderly and adults and children with predisposing underlying disease. The novel Corona virus outbreak, which started in China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over the world and turned into a pandemic. This pandemic, named as COVID-19 by WHO (World Health Organisation), caused economic and social losses all over the world and caused more than 450,000 deaths worldwide up to 21 June. COVID-19, whose specific antiviral therapy and preventive vaccine is not yet available, is still the most serious health problem in the world.Keywords: Coronaviruses, Pandemic, Pediatrics, Children COVID-19,Pandemi,Pediyatri,\\u00c7ocuk Volume: 3, Issue: \\u00d6zel Say\\u0131 140-148 ; 2651-4184 ; Medical Research Reports \\u00c7\\u0130FT\\u00c7\\u0130, Mustafa\"},{\"id\":\"d0dc3fceb175672c875b575e97e5f44bf7a002938ede0d9739cd780cb02f7231\",\"content\":\"Criteria to evaluate the communities\\u2019 plan and action against the corona virus Abstract Talking about evaluation of countries and communities\\u2019 responses to corona virus needs specific criteria; some of them are discussed in this manuscript as below: 1-Population: Count and structure of population affect the outcome of COVID-19 management, the elder population are more prone to mortality and morbidity from corona virus. 2-The Economic, Political and Social structure of the country: Given the experience gained, this is probably the most effective component on the outcome of Corona pandemic. 3-Solidarity and integrated managerial system coupled with people-centered politics are another issues that should be taken into more consideration in any evaluation process. Communities such as China, eastern and south-eastern countries which received orders and executions from one source were more successful. At the same time, communities such as England and the United States have suffered partly due to their unintegrated domestic policy. Despite the delay, thanks to the presence of a unified leadership and coherent management as well as community participation, our country was among the successful communities. 4-Structure of Health Delivery System (HDS): Universal coverage is an indicator to evaluate HDS. The more public health coverage, the more successful would be the plan. Iran, Scandinavian communities and Southeast Asian countries with their good universal coverage were more successful than western countries. It is worth noting here that England is an exceptional country owing to its good universal coverage based on leveling of services, referral system; however, its success was affected by its economic and political status as well as financial payments index which has been mainly defined for medical services. 5-Health Facilities: Efficacy of this item was under controlled by national economic and political managerial system and universal health coverage at health delivery system. The United States, for example, reveals 2 to 3 times as many manpower and hospital beds and equipment as many eastern and western communities. However, the public suffered from COVID-19 due to the poor socio-economic structure. Conflicts in providing these facilities further tarnished the image of the West. Iran otherwise of US sanctions did a good job regarding producing health facilities and even could exporte them. 6- Knowledge responding to corona virus: The experience and knowledge of responding to COVID-19 were distributed fast all over the globe and used by health providers; however, MOLECULLAR CELULLAR and DIGITAL sciences made difference among the countries. All of the successful countries such as china, Singapore, south chorea, Nippon benefited from these sciences, to build up the diagnostic facilities and detection of affected cases and thus responding fast to them. Iran was somewhat successful in molecular-cellular science; however, showed weak and dependent in digital science demonstrating needs to work more seriously in these fields not only in responding corona crisis but as a developmental knowledge, which is hoped to be considered by policymakers and managers in the future.

For most ordinary people in the Philippines, the corona virus that caused Corona Virus Disease in December 2019 (COVID 19) was not of big importance. The Philippine government was just observing the usual measure such as installing thermal screening in the airports to detect arriving passengers with flu. The virus continued to spread to the whole world. The continuous spread of the virus is the reason why mass media in print, in television, and other forms were used to educate people on how to prevent the spread of the virus. The Philippines positive cases were increasing almost exponentially. The Philippines government was getting more serious on the corona virus problem. President Rodrigo Duterte announced in the evening of March 12, 2020 of the month-long lock down of the whole Metro Manila from March 15 to April 14, 2020 as the country looks forward to contain the COVID 19. Land, domestic air and domestic sea to and from Metro Manila were suspended within the period. Social and religious activities that involved mass gathering were banned. Conferences, seminars and like activities were postponed and people were advised to stay at home. The lock down has brought about both negative and positive things to the government and to the people which can be observed commonly in every place. The negative things could fall into economic, social and psychological aspects. If corona virus brings negative and undesirable things in the community and in the Philippines, there are also positive things that sprouted. It is true indeed that a misfortune or a disaster to a place or persons can be an opportunity to others. Lots of things which are favorable and beneficial to many people and to the nature during the lock down which include economic, social and ecological aspects. The current situation brought by the corona virus that resulted to lock down implemented by the government of the Philippines gives an opportunity to learn the value of compassion and empathy in times of crisis.

An Algorithm for Its Application Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the corona virus disease-19 which is accompanied by severe pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar collapses and which stops oxygen exchange. Viral transmissibility and pathogenesis depend on recognition by a receptor in the host, protease cleavage of the host membrane and fusion. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor. Here, we discuss the general characteristics of the virus, its mechanism of action and the way in which the mechanism correlates with the comorbidities that increase the death rate. We also discuss the currently proposed therapeutic measures and propose the use of antioxidant drugs to help patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Oxidizing agents come from phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils that invade tissue. Free radicals promote cytotoxicity thus injuring cells. They also trigger the mechanism of inflammation by mediating the activation of NFkB and inducing the transcription of cytokine production genes. Release of cytokines enhances the inflammatory response. Oxidative stress is elevated during critical illnesses and contributes to organ failure. In corona virus disease-19 there is an intense inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm that could be mediated by oxidative stress. Although antioxidant therapy has not been tested in corona virus disease-19, the consequences of antioxidant therapy in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are known. It improves oxygenation rates, glutathione levels and strengthens the immune response. It reduces mechanical ventilation time, the length of stay in the intensive care unit, multiple organ dysfunctions and the length of stay in the hospital and mortality rates in acute lung injury\\/acute respiratory distress syndrome and could thus help patients with corona virus disease-19.

In addition, it is best to exempt income tax on imports, which needs to be reviewed, especially regarding the qualifications of goods that can be incentivized.

Methodology- The study employs descriptive statistics analyses for macroeconomic indicators of leading export markets of Turkish economy.Findings- The analysis shows that Turkish Economy export income would decline 30 percent relative to 2019 due to sudden shock and lockdowns and losses, deaths and illnesses during the first quarter of 2020.Conclusion- The World Economy has been expected to shrink 3 percent at 2020. This is larger than 1.68 percent decline in growth rate at 2009. In 2009 financial crises, Turkish export volume decreased in 2009. At 2020, the export of Turkey would decrease 30 percent due to decline of import demand of major export markets of EU, OECD and member countries of Islamic Cooperation Countries.

Due to the short duration of the virus pandemic, few studies have been reported on transmission routes. Identifying ways of transmitting the disease will be very effective in preventing its spread. We reviewed the methods of transmission of COVID-19 including droplets, contact, airborne, vertical transmission to the fetus of infected mothers and fecal-oral by using data of published articles or official websites up to Apr 19, 2020. The most important routes of transmission of COVID-19 were droplets and contacts. The presence of the virus in the stool, even after a negative nasopharyngeal swab, was another major cause of shedding of infection. No maternal to fetus vertical transmission was seen. Infant is at risk after birth only through droplets during breastfeeding. Based on limited data, droplets, contact, airborne and fecal transmissions are important ways of transmitting the disease and there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses.

Every pregnant woman strives her best to give birth to a healthy child. As every pregnancy is a period of uncertainties and risks, pregnant women are anxious about their well-being and that of their baby. The list of concerns is endless with the addition of corona virus disease (COVID-19). If we look back into the past, viral infections such as influenza, H1N1, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused immense maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy. Due to compromised, pregnant women are more vulnerable to being infected. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of corona virus that is similar to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). These viruses spread primarily by coughing and sneezing or direct contact. Most patients infected with any one of these three strains of corona virus may remain asymptomatic or may develop relatively mild symptoms such as fever, cough and fatigue. However, some may develop severe forms of the disease leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure; requiring oxygen or other respiratory support. Pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV were at high risk of developing severe pneumonia; heart failure and other complications which could be life-threatening leading to death in many cases.

On 30 January WHO has declared it as a global health emergency. Total 1290 people have died in the Central Chinese city of Wuhan after a coronavirus epidemic. At this time the world is facing an unprecedented pandemic of novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2). According to the WHO, this disease has spread globally with 12,102,328confirmed cases and 551,046deaths as of July 10, 2020. Despite worldwide efforts to contain it, the pandemic is continuing to spread for want of a clinically-proven prophylaxis and therapeutic strategy. Corona Virus causes a number of causes a disease in mammals and birds but has also proved capable of infecting human in recent decades. In 2003,the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and, more recently, the Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) demonstrated CoV slethality when crossing the species barrier and infecting people. Coronaviridae family include a group of single, plus stranded RNA viruses from multiple species, causing previously identified diarrheal diseases and common cold. The seafood market was closed and decontaminated on 1 January 2020 the market for seafood was closed and decontaminated, while countries with travel links to Wuhan were on high alert for potential travellers with unexplained respiratory disease.

Some of the frequently asked queries include: if they would develop health problems like high blood pressure and\\/or diabetes; if they would have a normal delivery or would require an intervention in the form of cesarean section or instrumentation, if they would have the birth experience as they envision and if the stress is harmful during the ongoing pregnancy. Every pregnant woman strives her best to give birth to a healthy child. As every pregnancy is a period of uncertainties and risks, pregnant women are anxious about their well-being and that of their baby. The list of concerns is endless with the addition of corona virus disease (COVID-19). If we look back into the past, viral infections such as influenza, H1N1, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused immense maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy. Due to compromised, pregnant women are more vulnerable to being infected. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of corona virus that is similar to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). These viruses spread primarily by coughing and sneezing or direct contact. Most patients infected with any one of these three strains of corona virus may remain asymptomatic or may develop relatively mild symptoms such as fever, cough and fatigue. However, some may develop severe forms of the disease leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure; requiring oxygen or other respiratory support. Pregnant women infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV were at high risk of developing severe pneumonia; heart failure and other complications which could be life-threatening leading to death in many cases.

To explain the disease, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is described. World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus Corona (Covid-19) and declared that this virus spreads from one human to another by contamination and due to this tendency, it is spreading quickly in the country and all over the world. WHO also declared this virus an epidemic and total of 3,106,700 patient records, 214,645 deaths, and 944,593 recovered across the world due to this epidemic. Patients over 70 years of age are more at risk from COVID-19 compared with patients under 70 years of age. The virus curve of onset of symptoms peaked around in April. In this article the symptoms, preventions, treatment, and statics have been discussed. The real cause of the origin of this virus (Covid-19) is still unconfirmed. Although the fatality rates of COVID-19 are very less (about 2.67%) in total infected cases, if compared with SARS and MERS as early known viruses, but the area of spread and number of infected people with this virus is very high than other. In the past, successful vaccines and medications have overcome many disease threats like SARS and MERS. To fight this epidemic virus called Coronavirus (Covid-19), equally effective vaccines and beneficial medicines are required as soon as possible.

The number of deaths reached 3,087 people or 6%, the number of patients recovering 45,726 people. This type of single positive RNA strain infects the human respiratory tract and is sensitive to heat and can effectively be activated by chlorine-containing disinfectants. The source of the host is thought to come from animals, especially bats, and other vectors such as bamboo rats, camels and ferrets. Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Clinical syndrome is divided into uncomplicated, mild pneumonia and severe pneumonia. Specimen examination is taken from the throat swab (nasopharynx and oropharynx) and lower airway (sputum, bronchial rinse, endotracheal aspirate). Isolation was carried out on patients proven to be infected with Covid-19 to prevent wider spread.

Tafakkur goes beyond this life to a wider region, the hereafter, and transcends the superficiality of materialism to a deeper horizon, that is \\\"spirit\\\" which can motivate all external and internal activities of Muslims. According to Ibn Khaldun in the book Mukadimmah has a fairly broad understanding. Education is not only a teaching and learning process that is limited by four walls, but education is a process in which humans consciously capture, absorb, and experience natural events throughout the ages. This study aims to treat the epidemic of the Covid 19 virus corona with an Islamic Education perspective approach. This research is a qualitative research with a literature review approach. The results found that the tafakkur corona Covid 19 virus in the perspective of the Islamic religion produced findings through, namely; first, quarantine, namely isolating the area affected by the plague is an appropriate action; Second, be patient; Third, be kind and work hard; Fourth, pray a lot.Keywords: Tafakkur, Islamic Religious Education, Corona virus Covid 19 AbstrakTafakkur dalam bahasa Arab diartikan sebagai tindakan berpikir untuk menjembatani persepsi dan konsepsi dari kehidupan dunia ini ke kehidupan akhirat, dan dari makhluk ke Penciptanya, yaitu Allah Swt. Tafakkur melampaui hidup ini ke wilayah lebih luas, akhirat, dan melampaui kedangkalan materialisme menuju horizon lebih dalam, yaitu \\u201cruh\\u201d yang dapat memotivasi seluruh aktivitas eksternal dan internal kaum muslim. Menurut Ibn Khaldun di dalam buku Mukadimmah mempunyai pengertian yang cukup luas. Pendidikan bukan hanya merupakan proses belajar mengajar yang dibatasi oleh empat dinding, tetapi pendidikan adalah suatu proses dimana manusia secara sadar menangkap, menyerap, dan menghayati peristiwa-peristiwa alam sepanjang zaman. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk men-tafakkuri wabah corona virus Covid 19 dengan pendekatan perspektif Pendidikan Islam. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian kualitatif dengan pendekatan literature review. Hasil penelitian menemukan bahwa tafakkur corona virus Covid 19 dalam perspektif Agama Islam menghasilkan temuan melalui, yaitu; pertama, karantina yaitu mengisolasi daerah yang terkena wabah adalah sebuah tindakan yang tepat; Kedua, bersabar; Ketiga, berbaik sangka dan berikhtiarlah; Keempat, banyak berdoalah.Kata Kunci: Tafakkur, Pendidikan Agama Islam, Coronavirus Covid 19  SALAM: Jurnal Sosial dan Budaya Syar-i; Vol 7, No 3 (2020): Special Issue Coronavirus Covid-19; 211-216 ; 2654-9050 ; 2356-1459 Indriya, Indriya\"},{\"id\":\"5054c125c664ce8671fe67eacd8ff66fc74244daf838047c14e20ea4c24c6bc7\",\"content\":\"\\u00d6\\u011fretimde dijital d\\u00f6n\\u00fc\\u015f\\u00fcm ve \\u00f6\\u011frencilerin \\u00e7evrimi\\u00e7i \\u00f6\\u011frenmeye haz\\u0131r bulunu\\u015flu\\u011fu: Pandemi d\\u00f6neminde Pamukkale \\u00dcniversitesi \\u00f6\\u011frencileri \\u00fczerinde bir ara\\u015ft\\u0131rma ; Digital transformation in education and students&#039; readiness to learn online: A research on Pamukkale University students in the period of pandemic Ulusal ve\\/veya Uluslararas\\u0131 Pandemi d\\u00f6nemlerinin (salg\\u0131nlar\\u0131n) genel ya\\u015fam ko\\u015fullar\\u0131 yan\\u0131nda e\\u011fitim\\/\\u00f6\\u011fretim hayat\\u0131na \\u00f6nemli etkileri vard\\u0131r. \\u00d6zellikle 2019 y\\u0131l\\u0131nda \\u00c7in\\u2019in Wuhan \\u015fehrinde ortaya \\u00e7\\u0131kan Corona vir\\u00fcs\\u00fcn\\u00fcn (COVID-19) e\\u011fitim\\/\\u00f6\\u011fretim alanlar\\u0131na etkilerinden dolay\\u0131 \\u00f6\\u011fretimde dijital d\\u00f6n\\u00fc\\u015f\\u00fcm ve \\u00e7evrimi\\u00e7i e\\u011fitim konular\\u0131 daha fazla g\\u00fcndeme gelmeye ba\\u015flam\\u0131\\u015ft\\u0131r.

Digital transformation in education and online education started to be brought to the fore more, especially due to the effects of Corona Virus (COVID-19), which appeared in Wuhan, China in 2019, on education\\/training areas. Within this framework, since 15 March 2020, because of the epidemic of Corona virus, distance education (Online education, E-learning) has become a very popular subject due to the interruption of face-to-face education and training at universities with schools affiliated to the Ministry of Education. In this period, rather than whether students are ready for online learning, investments have been made in distance education technologies on the assumption that students\\/teachers have positive attitudes and technical capacity to distance education. The main purpose of this study is; before distance education begins at Pamukkale University, it is to analyze the readiness of students for distance education with the Hung (2010) Online Learning Readiness scale. Results show that students had readiness for online learning but found themselves insufficient in terms of online learning control, and readiness for online learning differs according to undergraduate students&#039; classes and whether they already have experience in online learning or not.

This virus is the development of the Mers virus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus). COVID-9 can spread quickly compared to the Mers virus. The problem in Pandeglang Regency is the lack of medical personnel and medical devices. This is because Pandeglang Regency is an underdeveloped region among other regencies in Banten Province. Therefore, this research is intended to be able to help check patients who have positive Covid-19. The method used is the forward chaining method which is considered simple but easy to be understood. This method uses a continuous trace system that will detect every symptom experienced by the patient. The data used in the form of a questionnaire the results of interviews with experts in their fields. This research is expected to be able to contribute to Pandeglang Regency and break the chain of the spread of Covid-19 in underdeveloped regions that are difficult to get medical personnel and adequate equipment. The conclusion of this research is the forward chaining method can solve this problem.Keywords \\u2013 Implementation, Forward Chaining Method, Covid-19, Berkah Pandeglang District Hospital (RSUD Berkah Pandeglang) Abstrak \\u2013 Pada tahun 2020 terjadi begitu maraknya virus yang menggemparkan dunia yaitu Coronavirus Disease 2019. Virus ini merupakan pengembangan dari virus MERS (middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus). Covid-9 dapat menularkan dengan cepat dibandingkan virus Mers.
