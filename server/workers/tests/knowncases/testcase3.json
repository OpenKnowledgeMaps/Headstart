Another aspect of this study refers to the average daily food-stuff consumption\\/inhabitant, showed in calories and nutritive factors. This indicator is a key-variable in quantifying the regional and global food-stuff consumption. In fact, it is the expression of the national average apparently food-stuff consumption. Of high importance for estimating the development level of a society and especially the life standard of its population are the costs for the food-stuff produces.

Capillary marketing is one of the most influential techniques in the issue of more sales in organizations especially in terms of selling food stuff. Food stuff should be sold in a short time due to the short durability. People who make better use of capillary marketing to supply their products and services can sell better and faster. Dependency of Iran's economy on oil incomes and affectability of such incomes from political, economic and international issues cause vulnerability and fragility of the economy. One of the ways of coping with this situation is developing new products that improves inland economic condition and causes an increase in non oil exports. Meanwhile, in addition to the role of food stuff in inland economic development, it can have a determining role in non oil export. Most of the families don't have financial ability to respond steamy needs of their children. Such children are just happy with watching colorful food and being influenced by messages they don't tend to traditional food. In fact, advertisements tell children what to wear play and eat. In this study we are going to discuss marketing of children's food stuff and its advertising methods in Iran.

Its products are also aiming to be viscerally equivalent in terms of their meatlike taste, texture, and overall sensory experience. These alternative proteins (APs) are not, however, intended merely as a substitute for conventional meat. Instead they are viewed and marketed by their developers as meat, made simply from a different raw material and via different methods. Yet as animal meat has become increasingly linked with environmental, health, and ethical concerns, Beyond Meat is having to negotiate a careful balance between positioning its products as meatlike in some respects and not meatlike in others in order to gain consumer adoption. To become \\u201cmeat\\u201d in consumer thinking not only depends on the things these APs are made of\\u2014both material and ideological\\u2014but also the things that are actively excluded; as such, their materiality is made of purposefully chosen \\u201cstuff\\u201d and \\u201cnon-stuff.\\u201d The article explores this decision making via my fieldwork encounters with Beyond Meat\\u2019s products. Using a visceral-autoethnographic approach, I discuss how certain (non)stuff was \\u201cmade to matter and not matter\\u201d (Evans and Miele 2012) to me during these encounters, and how this careful balancing of stuff can create new and problematic imaginaries, moral politics, and misguided understandings of what constitutes \\u201cbetter\\u201d foods and \\u201cbetter\\u201d eaters.

In those formative years of aviation and jet development, designers and pilots did not have the same design understanding and knowledge that we have today. In addition, they did not have the same understanding and knowledge of Systems Safety engineering and Human Factors expertise that we have today. Manned suborbital flights of today should be undertaken in vehicles that have been designed effectively with appropriately derived safety requirements including fault-tolerance, safe life and design-for-minimum risk approaches \\u2013 and all to an acceptable level of safety. Therefore, although initial suborbital pilots will originate from flight test schools and still possess similar traits to their earlier test pilot brethren, they should be protected by the right (safe) thing by design and analysis rather than rely on the right stuff due to ineffective design and operating procedures. The paper presents a review of the SpaceShip2 accident as a case study to highlight the right (safe) things that should be considered in the design, analysis and operations for suborbital operators. The authors of this paper contend that suborbital piloted vehicles should be designed with the knowledge and understanding and lessons learned from those early X-plane flights, lessons learned from general space safety, lessons learned from pilot Human Factors\\/ Crew Resource Management training and by understanding that safety management and safety engineering are essential disciplines that should be integrated with the design team from the concept phase.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017-07-13\",\"subject_orig\":\"Business operations; Strategy\",\"subject\":\"Business operations; Strategy\",\"authors\":\"Quinn, Andy; Sikora, Ivan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/repository.uwl.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/6076\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"bb5badf5324e0b548799564e12c397ddaa076c03339d4dfcbebd4924387a3b68\",\"relevance\":94},{\"id\":\"47351f8f6c34bd2a517dfc0daf9631022f3b805cf404328932e67da364777f46\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/psasir.upm.edu.my\\/55420\\/1\\/David%20Hare%E2%80%99s%20Stuff%20Happens.pdf; Salih, Elaff Ganim and Kaur, Hardev and Hassan, Mohamad Fleih (2016) David Hares stuff happens a dramatic journey of American war on Iraq.

The tragic consequences of this war led many writers around the world to question the policy of the United States and its manipulation of facts to justify their narratives. The present study examines the American policy of invading Iraq in David Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens. It investigates Hare\\u2019s technique of combining documentary realism with imaginative reconstruction of the arguments to dramatize the American Invasion of Iraq. Stuff Happens is a historical and political play written as a verbatim theatre. It depicts the backroom deals and political maneuvers of the Bush administration in justifying their campaign against the \\u2018Axis of Evil\\u2019 culminated by the war against Iraq. The verbatim theatre is the best way of showing the gap between \\u2018what is said and what is seen to be done\\u2019. Scenes of direct speeches by real characters are part of this theatre dramatized to present a new reading of a historical event. In addition, characterization is used by Hare\\u2019s to chronicle the American war on Iraq. The study follows a postcolonial framework. The study concludes that Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens succeeded in shaking the public opinion with the truth that Bush\\u2019s administration has manipulated facts in order to achieve their colonial and imperial interests in Iraq, which led to more destruction and violence in this country.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Salih, Elaff Ganim;

The wastewater can be characterized as a highly variable, highly colored wastewater. A biological wastewater treatment plant uses a natural biological process-metabolism, to destroy waste organic matter. The most important parameter in the Arthur Operation Strategy is \\u201dtreatment time\\u201d. The main purpose of this research is to evaluate the treatability-toxicity of the dye stuff and paper wastewater by using the Arthur Instrument. This work points out that changes in degrees of treatability, due to changes in substance of samples, were shown by developing reaction rate and oxygen volume consumption graphs. These graphs were developed from the data obtained from a series of tests at various samples to activated sludge. In this research the important point was that the toxins were tested using the mixed liquor from dye stuff and paper industry giving us a direct indication of the toxic effect and an actual measurement of the treatment time. Based entirety on biological measurements, we have an actual message of the length of time it takes for the microbes in dye stuff and paper industry to treat the waste coming into aeration basin. Finally, this paper shows that the best treatment process for dye stuff and paper industry is two-stage activated carbon sludge process.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"1996-03\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u751f\\u7269\\u8655\\u7406; Arthur\\u5100\\u5668; \\u6d3b\\u6027\\u78b3\\u6ce5; \\u8655\\u7406\\u505c\\u7559\\u6642\\u9593; \\u56de\\u6536\\u518d\\u5229\\u7528; Arthur Instrument; Reaction Rate; Microbe; Biodegradable; Activated Carbon Sludge; Treatment Time; Dye Stuff\",\"subject\":\"\\u751f\\u7269\\u8655\\u7406; Arthur\\u5100\\u5668; \\u6d3b\\u6027\\u78b3\\u6ce5; \\u8655\\u7406\\u505c\\u7559\\u6642\\u9593; \\u56de\\u6536\\u518d\\u5229\\u7528; Arthur Instrument; Reaction Rate; Microbe; Biodegradable; Activated Carbon Sludge; Treatment Time; Dye Stuff\",\"authors\":\"\\u937e\\u5ef6\\u6625; \\u8a31\\u5609\\u5f70; \\u738b\\u4fe1\\u6613\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.lib.pccu.edu.tw\\/\\/handle\\/987654321\\/28805\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1c775470c3e102d38d472d521b39447c4d9a490bd029efb6a1dd989a82a4d15b\",\"relevance\":92},{\"id\":\"8868b493b3ca743a43dc30529bda01c336a5c7bc63577aed47deebca17d2f197\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\\/portal\\/en\\/publications\\/genomic-stuff(f2980ad6-690a-43bc-ac1c-317775c39838).html; http:\\/\\/www.scopus.com\\/inward\\/record.url?partnerID=yv4JPVwI&eid=2-s2.0-80053583369&md5=4ea25439096aea43646ff76d7e13e51b\",\"title\":\"Genomic stuff:Governing the (im)matter of life\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Emphasizing the context of what has often been referred to as \\\"scarce natural resources\\\", in particular forests, meadows, and fishing stocks, Elinor Ostrom's important works, including Governing the commons (1990) and Understanding institutional diversity (2005), present an institutional framework for discussing the development and use of collective action with respect to environmental problems. In this article we discuss extensions of Ostrom's approach to human genes and genomes and explore its limits and usefulness in this field. We argue that while there are radically different contexts and cases and governance regimes still to be debated, what we call \\\"genomic stuff\\\"-genomic material, data, and information-often can best be regulated by modes of stewardship and self-regulation of appropriators. We exemplify this claim by a discussion of gene patenting, the \\\"Genome War\\\", and the so-called HapMap project. The issue of how to best govern the genomic stuff of humans, we suggest, is complicated by the situation that the appropriator and the appropriated can be the same, inviting fundamental questions about politics and ethics.\",\"published_in\":\"P\\u00e1lsson , G & Prainsack , B 2011 , ' Genomic stuff : Governing the (im)matter of life ' International Journal of the Commons , vol 5 , no. 2 , pp. 259-283 .\",\"year\":\"2011-08-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"P\\u00e1lsson, G.; Prainsack, Barbara\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\\/portal\\/en\\/publications\\/genomic-stuff(f2980ad6-690a-43bc-ac1c-317775c39838).html\",\"oa_state\":\"0\",\"url\":\"8868b493b3ca743a43dc30529bda01c336a5c7bc63577aed47deebca17d2f197\",\"relevance\":91},{\"id\":\"4a77e92cfca91427a18127826aaf8b815538e9cda35fd14b38f273e5ed87c555\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/gfc.2016.16.3.66\",\"title\":\"Alternative Proteins and the (Non)Stuff of \\u201cMeat\\u201d\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Beyond Meat, a food technology company based in California, is currently developing a range of plant-based proteins that aim to provide more sustainable, ethical, and healthful alternatives to conventional meat. Its products are also aiming to be viscerally equivalent in terms of their meatlike taste, texture, and overall sensory experience. These alternative proteins (APs) are not, however, intended merely as a substitute for conventional meat. Instead they are viewed and marketed by their developers as meat, made simply from a different raw material and via different methods. Yet as animal meat has become increasingly linked with environmental, health, and ethical concerns, Beyond Meat is having to negotiate a careful balance between positioning its products as meatlike in some respects and not meatlike in others in order to gain consumer adoption. To become \\u201cmeat\\u201d in consumer thinking not only depends on the things these APs are made of\\u2014both material and ideological\\u2014but also the things that are actively excluded; as such, their materiality is made of purposefully chosen \\u201cstuff\\u201d and \\u201cnon-stuff.\\u201d The article explores this decision-making via my fieldwork encounters with Beyond Meat's products. Using a visceral-autoethnographic approach, I discuss how certain (non)stuff was \\u201cmade to matter and not matter\\u201d (Evans and Miele 2012) to me during these encounters, and how this careful balancing of stuff can create new and problematic imaginaries, moral politics, and misguided understandings of what constitutes \\u201cbetter\\u201d foods and \\u201cbetter\\u201d eaters.

Their physics is encoded in the higher n-point functions of the conformal theory. We study inclusive processes and argue that the inclusive production of unparticle stuff in standard model processes due to the unparticle self-interactions can be decomposed using the conformal partial wave expansion and its generalizations into a sum over contributions from the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff, corresponding to different primary conformal operators. Such processes typically involve the production of unparticle stuff associated with operators other than those to which the standard model couples directly. Thus just as interactions between particles allow scattering processes to produce new particles in the final state, so unparticle self-interactions cause the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff. We discuss both inclusive and exclusive methods for computing these processes. The resulting picture, we believe, is a step towards understanding what unparticle stuff \\u201clooks like\\u201d because it is quite analogous to way we describe the production and scattering of ordinary particles in quantum field theory, with the primary conformal operators playing the role of particles and the coefficients in the conformal partial wave expansion (and its generalization to include more fields) playing the role of amplitudes. We exemplify our methods in the 2D toy model that we discussed previously in which the Banks-Zaks theory is exactly solvable. ; Physics\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2010\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Georgi, Howard; Kats, Yevgeny\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nrs.harvard.edu\\/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4317739\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ba3aa74362f15e9f53d73893752f0cc33c032dd1af4e7c4c8eff2a0ea05380c3\",\"relevance\":88},{\"id\":\"60822a22ab3f64a634a81a5ed297609734e5f07125780c9dcf587f1bfbad1e17\",\"relation\":\"NECSUS.

In general, film genres help us understand the world. More specifically, the Hollywood Western is the film\\u2019s point of departure for its depiction of the astronaut\\u2019s immediate predecessor \\u2013 the test pilot; yet it is the family melodrama and the comedy that should be acknowledged as more important for understanding the astronaut as the test pilot\\u2019s successor. To be precise, understanding the history of space travel in terms of Hollywood genres requires an examination of the way in which THE RIGHT STUFF has marked the transition from a covert, military operation (test pilots) to a civilian public relations project (astronauts) as the succession of the Western by the family melodrama and the comedy of remarriage.\",\"published_in\":\"Staat, Wim (2016): THE RIGHT STUFF: From Western to melodrama and comedy.

Superflab, Super Stuff pink wax and Paraffin wax bolus materials are used with 15MeV electron energy for dosimetric comparison. Additionally, 10 mm thick Super Stuff pink wax bolus and paraffin wax bolus materials were placed on the right eyelid of a patient. Using electron dose calculation algorithm and ion chamber measurements, dosimetric comparisons were made in the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Both for measured and calculated dose, values were acquired 3 times and averaged for each case. Resulting differences are expressed as percentage differences. Dose differences were obtained in measurements with and without using bolus at several locations of the solid phantom, performed by the Roos Ion chamber. Dosimetric differences of 7-7.5% for Superflab, 10-10.5% for paraffin bolus and 13-14% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus are obtained. Besides, when dosimetric comparisons are made in the treatment planning system for cases with and without bolus; Dose differences were calculated to be 2-2.5% for superflab silicon bolus, 3-3.5% for paraffin wax bolus and 5-6% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus. To increase skin dose in curved anatomical structures in radiotherapy, it is safe to use the paraffin wax bolus material in radiotherapy clinic, as an alternative to Superflab silicon bolus and Super Stuff pink wax bolus materials, due to its low cost and ease of conforming to body surface contours.\",\"published_in\":\"Volume: 16, Issue: 2 201-205 ; 1305-130X ; 1305-1385 ; Celal Bayar University Journal of Science\",\"year\":\"2020-06-24T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Radiotherapy,Superflab,Paraffin,Super Stuff\",\"subject\":\"Radiotherapy,Superflab,Paraffin,Super Stuff\",\"authors\":\"ARAS, Serhat; TANZER, \\u0130hsan Oguz; \\u0130K\\u0130ZCEL\\u0130, T\\u00fcrkan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/cbayarfbe\\/issue\\/55133\\/654782\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"aef90adac1fcf5749967853e586d7084350db74d0886d1d878de7727635d27ba\",\"relevance\":83},{\"id\":\"98a866bc1f328f0b4bcaa1aed142fda692b782c5ca208aeaff1e8a484a9de75a\",\"relation\":\"issn:2414-2948; http:\\/\\/www.bulletennauki.com\\/osmanova; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.244251; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/244251\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.244251; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/244251\",\"title\":\"The Competency Model In Evaluation And Management Of The Staff Enterprise\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract ; The study is conducted to examine the place and role of the competency model in the evaluation and management of the stuff enterprise.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the \\\"Law of the few\\\", the \\\"Stickiness factor\\\", and the \\\"Power of context\\\". For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as \\\"interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks\\\", for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.\",\"published_in\":\"Rutten , G M , Savelberg , H H , Biddle , S J & Kremers , S P 2013 , ' Interrupting long periods of sitting: Good STUFF ' , International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity , vol. 10 , no. 1 , 1 . https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/1479-5868-10-1\",\"year\":\"2013-01-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sedentary behavior; Physical activity; Sitting time reduction; Health promotion; Dissemination; BEHAVIOR-CHANGE INTERVENTIONS; LIPOPROTEIN-LIPASE ACTIVITY; PHYSICAL INACTIVITY; SEDENTARY TIME; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; POPULATION HEALTH; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; PHYSIOLOGY; PARADIGM; BREAKS\",\"subject\":\"Sedentary behavior; Physical activity; Sitting time reduction; Health promotion; Dissemination; BEHAVIOR-CHANGE INTERVENTIONS; LIPOPROTEIN-LIPASE ACTIVITY; PHYSICAL INACTIVITY; SEDENTARY TIME;  POPULATION HEALTH;  PHYSIOLOGY; PARADIGM; BREAKS\",\"authors\":\"Rutten, G.M.; Savelberg, H.H.; Biddle, S.

The tragic consequences of this war led many writers around the world to question the policy of the United States and its manipulation of facts to justify their narratives. The present study examines the American policy of invading Iraq in David Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens . It investigates Hare\\u2019s technique of combining documentary realism with imaginative reconstruction of the arguments to dramatize the American Invasion of Iraq. Stuff Happens is a historical and political play written as a verbatim theatre. It depicts the backroom deals and political maneuvers of the Bush administration in justifying their campaign against the \\u2018Axis of Evil\\u2019 culminated by the war against Iraq. The verbatim theatre is the best way of showing the gap between \\u2018what is said and what is seen to be done\\u2019. Scenes of direct speeches by real characters are part of this theatre dramatized to present a new reading of a historical event. In addition, characterization is used by Hare\\u2019s to chronicle the American war on Iraq. The study follows a postcolonial framework. The study concludes that Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens succeeded in shaking the public opinion with the truth that Bush\\u2019s administration has manipulated facts in order to achieve their colonial and imperial interests in Iraq, which led to more destruction and violence in this country.\",\"published_in\":\"International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences ; volume 67, page 57-69 ; ISSN 2300-2697\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Salih, Elaff Ganim; Kaur, Hardev; Hassan, Mohamad Fleih\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.18052\\/www.scipress.com\\/ilshs.67.57\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"29eb08b7fe704fd3f877348683ecb4653324d2eeabcb2d1a78b0124228e7bc7c\",\"relevance\":62},{\"id\":\"498060ae60242bd04ee357cc977c75e1d49258af6ac4e7d665762ae669b61d59\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/1655475; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/069412b0; oai:zenodo.org:1655475\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/1655475; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/069412b0\",\"title\":\"Chalk-stuff Gas\",\"paper_abstract\":\"n\\/a\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"1904-03-03\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Armstrong, Henry E.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/1655475\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"498060ae60242bd04ee357cc977c75e1d49258af6ac4e7d665762ae669b61d59\",\"relevance\":61},{\"id\":\"e39a298ec4bfd42dcfe43870868fef13de72ddb979f93de6df302076d0dd8a30\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2252148; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/mind\\/os-vii.25.110; oai:zenodo.org:2252148\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2252148; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/mind\\/os-vii.25.110\",\"title\":\"PROF.

His reasons are persuasive. First, it provides a rich vein of initial stimulus material to tap, helping us to engage and intrigue even our least motivated learners. Second, it allows students to construct layers of meaning that might escape them purely through the written word. Students often find it easier to \\u2018read\\u2019 the tone of a source by listening to it and this can be a powerful way to consider perspective. Third, the use of this type of music supports close textual analysis, providing ways of exploring the lyrics at different levels. Finally, it helps us to pose rigorous historical questions about significance and interpretation. Enquiries that explore why people still sing about the Diggers and what impact Billie Holliday\\u2019s songs had on the Civil Rights movement provide students with both challenge and motivation.

British playwright, David Hare, belongs to a trend of war drama that enables the world to witness the truth, trauma and the violence of US-Iraq war. Stuff Happens subtly helps show how US coercive diplomacy manipulates other Powers to fulfill the new doctrine of \\\" New American Century.\\\" In Stuff Happens, Hare documents the recent tragic history of Iraq in such an approach that blends the documentary with the fictional to display the events from 2000, till the actual invasion of Iraq in April, 2003.

Benjamin argues that the production of an immaterial similarity is in some way an act of magic. But it is also at the same time an overcoming of magic itself. And the reason is that the \\u201cimmaterial similarity\\u201d can open the way to a \\u201cmaterialistic perspective\\u201d. How can that be? In order to answer, we\\u2019ll consider Benjamin\\u2019s idea of \\u201cmatter\\u201d. In Benjamin\\u2019s early writings matter (Materie) appears, as we shall see, as something magic. But there is another idea, which is quite near to matter but is not exactly the same: the idea of \\u201cstuff\\u201d (Stoff). The stuff is the \\u201cmaterial\\u201d things are made of. If we search for a definition of it, we can find that it is \\u201cthe mute, soft and flocky element that \\u2013 like the snow in the snow globes \\u2013 clouds over inside the core of things\\u201d. We are going to examine this problematic definition. We\\u2019ll discover that way that the idea of stuff marks, in comparison to matter, a possibility.

Whilst dance is known as a feminine activity, males tend to be even more in the minority in more \\u2018feminised\\u2019 genres, such as ballet. However, in other genres, such as street dance, which allows them to conform to a more traditionally masculine identity, they are in the majority. Regardless of genre, however, males are more often found in positions of power within the dance-performer\\u2019s world compared to their female counterparts. Dance teachers clearly have an important role to play in dance students\\u2019 perceptions of gendered (in)equalities within the dance world, where the majority of dance teachers are female. To date, however, their perceptions have been under-researched. To address this research gap, 10 female professional dance teachers, ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, were interviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis through the theoretical lens of symbolic interactionism. Two salient themes were identified: coolness and masculinity, and male privilege. Participants perceived that gender inequalities did exist within dance genres and in the opportunities afforded to male and female dancers. These inequalities appeared to lead to a greater valorisation of male dancers in terms of physical and psychological characteristics. The perceptions of female dance teachers in general are important in relation to the socialisation of future dance professionals.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-09-24\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Clegg, Helen; Owton, Helen; Allen-Collinson, Jacquelyn\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nectar.northampton.ac.uk\\/11752\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"04fdcf8f93f1ba4d3fc9ba985780b98898907e6011ee3f31579b59253b7b3310\",\"relevance\":53},{\"id\":\"35721a734ff97254e271c530aee8509cde4c454daa3b637a1f3b7af2658b0159\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/1739546; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/14786449908677149; oai:zenodo.org:1739546\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/1739546; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/14786449908677149\",\"title\":\"VIII.

Consequently, the multistage escape system and separate component such as small self-rescuers, reswitching points, life-safety for fixed and portable refuge chambers, emergency alarm system are established. ; SeriesInformation ; \\u21162-2017 (2018)\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u0441\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u0441\\u043f\\u0430\\u0441\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c; \\u043f\\u0443\\u043d\\u043a\\u0442\\u044b \\u043f\\u0435\\u0440\\u0435\\u043a\\u043b\\u044e\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f; \\u0441\\u0440\\u0435\\u0434\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0430 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u0437\\u0430\\u0449\\u0438\\u0442\\u044b; \\u044d\\u0432\\u0430\\u043a\\u0443\\u0430\\u0446\\u0438\\u044f \\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u043d\\u043e\\u0440\\u0430\\u0431\\u043e\\u0447\\u0438\\u0445; \\u0441\\u0438\\u0441\\u0442\\u0435\\u043c\\u044b \\u0416\\u0438\\u0437\\u043d\\u0435\\u043e\\u0431\\u0435\\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f; SELF-RESCUER; RESWITCHING POINT; COLLECTIVE PROTECTIVE MEANS; MINE STUFF EVACUATION; LIFE-SAFETY SYSTEM\",\"subject\":\"\\u0441\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u0441\\u043f\\u0430\\u0441\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c; \\u043f\\u0443\\u043d\\u043a\\u0442\\u044b \\u043f\\u0435\\u0440\\u0435\\u043a\\u043b\\u044e\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f; \\u0441\\u0440\\u0435\\u0434\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0430 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u0437\\u0430\\u0449\\u0438\\u0442\\u044b; \\u044d\\u0432\\u0430\\u043a\\u0443\\u0430\\u0446\\u0438\\u044f \\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u043d\\u043e\\u0440\\u0430\\u0431\\u043e\\u0447\\u0438\\u0445; \\u0441\\u0438\\u0441\\u0442\\u0435\\u043c\\u044b \\u0416\\u0438\\u0437\\u043d\\u0435\\u043e\\u0431\\u0435\\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f;  RESWITCHING POINT; COLLECTIVE PROTECTIVE MEANS; MINE STUFF EVACUATION; LIFE-SAFETY SYSTEM\",\"authors\":\"\\u041f\\u0410\\u0428\\u041a\\u041e\\u0412\\u0421\\u041a\\u0418\\u0419 \\u041f.\\u0421.; \\u041f\\u041b\\u0415\\u0422\\u0415\\u041d\\u0415\\u0426\\u041a\\u0418\\u0419 \\u0420.\\u0421.; \\u0413\\u041e\\u0412\\u0416\\u0415\\u0415\\u0412 \\u0412.\\u0412.; \\u0417\\u0411\\u041e\\u0420\\u0429\\u0418\\u041a \\u041b.\\u0410.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25558\\/VOSTNII.2017.2-2017.12442\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"208f42f73b9cda6c59e63c7c6c2113ecab93f6e9503dcc6f58451636c4984081\",\"relevance\":41},{\"id\":\"dab185cecf7d1363e08ef0e4bfa481d0f7bb27c4c1bc66b2912edc846c3034d6\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ajol.info\\/index.php\\/pp\\/article\\/view\\/29539\",\"title\":\"The Thesis of Vague Objects and Unger's Problem of the Many\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Peter Unger argues that his puzzle of the problem of the many leaves us with having to accept either countless embedded objects of the same kind or a Parmenidean rejection of distinct entities. This dilemma can be avoided if objects truly have vague boundaries. It is metaphysically impossible for an entity with a vague boundary to be embedded within an entity of the same kind. A cloud's parts (that is, cloud stuff) cannot be clearly embedded within the vague boundary region of another cloud, for the latter region is defined as possessing neither cloud-stuff nor non-cloud-stuff. Likewise, there cannot be a cloud with a vague boundary embedded in the middle of another cloud because there would then have to be a population of water droplets dense enough to compose part of the larger cloud which was nevertheless insufficient in density to compose part of the embedded cloud.\",\"published_in\":\"Philosophical Papers; Vol 30, No 1 (2001); 57-67\",\"year\":\"2006-10-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"David B.

Characterized as a kind of intermediate stuff, the apeiron turns out to consist of contraries and as such is impossible. Commentators have rightly noted this point and some have also indicated that Aristotle offers an argument of sorts for his negative estimate. However, the argument has received scant attention, and it is fair to say that it remains unclear exactly why Aristotle rejects Anaximander\\u2019s intermediate stuff. Indeed, it is unclear how Aristotle\\u2019s argument is supposed to run in the first place. This paper offers a reconstruction of Aristotle\\u2019s argument for the impossibility of the apeiron , and on this basis offers to explain Aristotle\\u2019s grounds for rejecting Anaximander\\u2019s intermediate stuff. This is especially called for in light of the fact that Aristotle himself thinks that there can be intermediate stuffs. Finally, some attention is given to the parallel between the apeiron and Aristotle\\u2019s prime matter.\",\"published_in\":\"Phronesis ; volume 58, issue 1, page 17-31 ; ISSN 0031-8868 1568-5284\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wedin, Michael\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/15685284-12341240\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"c8607d0d25ec1497568b6e3223b56630bfe7fb541c472cb6104fef80209f7a98\",\"relevance\":38},{\"id\":\"341007acd4b536dd2d0cb4d9f1337a0ed5642a201338c2432447f52b6eaf77a9\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/vsp.spr-journal.ru:80\\/jour\\/article\\/view\\/1188; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1682-5527; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1682-5535; 1682-5527; 1682-5535; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a74a1f2ec3a045d4be0d328c74e1ba6f\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a74a1f2ec3a045d4be0d328c74e1ba6f\",\"title\":\"COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF CANDIDAL DYSBACTERIOSIS THERAPY\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The study of effectiveness of different methods of microbiological disorders correction in children after 3 years old with candidal dysbacteriosis are presented in this article.

In answer to these questions we present four case studies of homes in Melbourne, Australia, each representative of a particular strategy of synchronisation.

We identify logics informing these homes: the first naturalises the choices made, the second rationalises choices, and the third is one in which dwelling and (re)building are intertwined.\",\"published_in\":\"Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, Vol. 29 (Apr 2011), pp. 693-715\",\"year\":\"2011\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Nansen, Bjorn; Arnold, Michael; Gibbs, Martin; Davis, Hilary\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/353758\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"51215b4c7fc1c3363d9decf61db4cb361e57589e0e728729cb288e8dc36c3f94\",\"relevance\":35},{\"id\":\"60f11062d6fc0577f0bf2ccc48e654dfe6b8e056c7ff90a999d04c1754dd29f6\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ejournal.unri.ac.id\\/index.php\\/JTB\\/article\\/view\\/1949\\/1918\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ejournal.unri.ac.id\\/index.php\\/JTB\\/article\\/view\\/1949\",\"title\":\"ANALISIS PENGENDALIAN ROBOT PENGANGKUT BARANG DENGAN REMOTE JOYSTICK\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Development in electronic science has improved sophisticated progressed in the use ofrobot in industry such as making stuff lifted by robot.

In this article we discuss extensions of Ostroms approach to human genes and genomes and explore its limits and usefulness in this field. We argue that while there are radically different contexts and cases and governance regimes still to be debated, what we call 'genomic stuff' genomic material, data, and information often can best be regulated by modes of stewardship and self-regulation of appropriators. We exemplify this claim by a discussion of gene patenting, the 'Genome War', and the so-called HapMap project. The issue of how to best govern the genomic stuff of humans, we suggest, is complicated by the situation that the appropriator and the appropriated can be the same, inviting fundamental questions about politics and ethics.\\\"\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2011\",\"subject_orig\":\"global commons; Ostrom; Elinor; governance and politics; Social Organization\",\"subject\":\"global commons; Ostrom; Elinor; governance and politics; Social Organization\",\"authors\":\"P??lsson, G??sli; Prainsack, Barbara\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10535\\/7548\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e0d5eae857ae4581457ef85b6de3c776f2f17f71e69a30042397e60d40eb40ff\",\"relevance\":32},{\"id\":\"502e77f10c5e2c7bda2883613c541051d90d04e18eb6bd6a4eba6c13c6fef2b8\",\"relation\":\"Drexel University.

We show that such properties can be local (classical mechanics), as well as holistic (quantum mechanics), and discuss two metaphysical options to conceive them, namely, Humeanism and modal realism in the guise of dispositionalism.\",\"published_in\":\"The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, vol. 68, no. 1, pp. 133-161\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"primitive ontology; primitive stuff; ontic structural realism; identical particles; Bohmian mechanics; Humeanism; modal realism; dispositionalism\",\"subject\":\"primitive ontology; primitive stuff; ontic structural realism; identical particles; Bohmian mechanics; Humeanism; modal realism; dispositionalism\",\"authors\":\"Esfeld, Michael; Lazarovici, Dustin; Lam, Vincent; Hubert, Mario\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/notice\\/serval:BIB_6F7362001A3A\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"4e358d95dd24028ee6d7820891e428f970b11a923a99a27608fc19b9b320e967\",\"relevance\":27},{\"id\":\"1d274e7ade6b007aac2fb7737ff6d554fec29fefa63d7819fbe5fb44f825b6e5\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1557\\/opl.2011.1176; https:\\/\\/www.cambridge.org\\/core\\/services\\/aop-cambridge-core\\/content\\/view\\/S1946427411011766\",\"title\":\"Making Stuff at Princeton University\",\"paper_abstract\":\"ABSTRACT The Princeton Center for Complex Materials (PCCM) joined the PBS NOVA\\/MRS Making Stuff coalition and created a program to inspire middle school students and their teachers about materials science during exciting large programs at Princeton University and multiple pre and post events. As a National Science Foundation funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, it is part of PCCM\\u2019s mission to inspire and educate school children, teachers and the public about STEM and materials science. Research shows that it is critical to excite students at a young age and maintain that excitement, and without that these, students are two to three times less likely to have any interest in science and engineering and pursue science careers as adults. The Making Stuff TV series offered a great teachable moment in materials science for students and teachers alike. The four episodes, Stronger, Smaller, Smarter and Cleaner aired in January and February, 2011. Our complementary education program helped promote the viewership of the Making Stuff series in the region, and the NOVA episodes helped us by priming the teachers and students to learn more about materials science research conducted at Princeton University. The Making Stuff coalition events we conducted were designed to have the maximum positive impact on students\\u2019 attitudes towards science and scientists, in general, and materials scientists and engineers, specifically. Each and every student had an opportunity to interact with dozens of scientists and engineers, in the lab, at table demonstrations and lecture presentations. As an ongoing MRSEC education and outreach program we have developed many successful educational partnerships to increase our impact. Plus, through years of successful education programs and the participation of our materials scientists and engineers, we have cultivated great trust in the schools and local community. The schools eagerly joined as partners in the program to bring their students to the event. Teachers from those partner schools actively participated in associated professional development programs conducted by education staff and PCCM professors before and after the big event. Included were presentations by MRSEC members and the partners from Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials (PRISM), Princeton University\\u2019s chemistry department, DOE funded centers PP-SOC and PPPL, Liberty Science Center, Franklin Institute, our PBS partner NJN and our many school district partners.\",\"published_in\":\"MRS Proceedings ; volume 1364 ; ISSN 0272-9172 1946-4274\",\"year\":\"2011\",\"subject_orig\":\"Mechanical Engineering; General Materials Science; Mechanics of Materials; Condensed Matter Physics\",\"subject\":\"Mechanical Engineering; General Materials Science; Mechanics of Materials; Condensed Matter Physics\",\"authors\":\"Steinberg, Daniel J.; Greco, Shannon\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1557\\/opl.2011.1176\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1d274e7ade6b007aac2fb7737ff6d554fec29fefa63d7819fbe5fb44f825b6e5\",\"relevance\":26},{\"id\":\"5110758cede7437ae0e8d6d04295b35809d6cf5dded3f6cd000d481fddd314c5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.usq.edu.au\\/31844\\/1\\/Biddle_2013_PV.pdf; Rutten, Geert M. and Savelberg, Hans H. and Biddle, Stuart J.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the 'Law of the few' , the 'Stickiness factor' , and the 'Power of context'. For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as 'interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks' , for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-01-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Rutten, Geert M.; Savelberg, Hans H.; Biddle, Stuart J.

The paper explains how Bush deals with the opponents\\u2014Colin Powell, the British PM Tony Blair, and Hans Blix\\u2014opposing his decision, based on \\\"fabricated\\\" evidence, by employing his father's strategy of coercive diplomacy against them, depending on both his faith and his position as President. Drawing on a postcolonial approach, the analysis of Hare's piece has demonstrated two significant aspects: 1) Bush, implementing such a strategy of coercive diplomacy, has succeeded in achieving his private agenda in invading Iraq; 2) Hare is possessed of the dramatic dexterity of mixing fiction (the significant roles of the nameless fictional characters as well as the unnamed narrator-actors) with facts (the main figures of politics) for supporting play\\u2019s different conflicts. The present paper has reached a number of findings. First, the US attacked Iraq, for Bush had to show his people some reaction to the 9\\/11 attacks. Second, Bush chose Iraq in particular and not North Korea, for instance, for his personal motives. Third, the US's double standard is stressed through the unresolved Israeli\\/Palestinian conflict negotiated throughout. Fourth, the coercive-diplomacy strategy has always been the US\\u2019s means for (il-) legal ends and, thus, this strategy can be considered a postcolonial construct in Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens .\",\"published_in\":\"International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences ; volume 62, page 73-90 ; ISSN 2300-2697\",\"year\":\"2015\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Sirwah, Khaled S.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.18052\\/www.scipress.com\\/ilshs.62.73\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ed10af62c72559b7e8a4551800e29c41111f09e82b01742ebb977146d1ede5ca\",\"relevance\":23},{\"id\":\"130f5c221212d84e8160c9ee9b97863535bd038412a76da615655252335100cb\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/156852807x177931\",\"title\":\"On the Physical Aspect of Heraclitus' Psychology\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract The paper first discusses the metaphysical framework that allows the soul's integration into the physical world. A close examination of B36, supported by the comparative evidence of some other early theories of the soul, suggests that the word psuch\\u00ea could function as both a mass term and a count noun for Heraclitus. There is a stuff in the world, alongside other physical elements, that manifests mental functions. Humans, and possibly other beings, show mental functions in so far as they have a portion of that stuff. Turning to the physical characterization of the soul, the paper argues that B36 is entirely consistent with the ancient testimonies that say that psuch\\u00ea for Heraclitus is exhalation. But exhalations cover all states of matter from the lowest moist part of atmospheric air to the fire of celestial bodies. If so, psuch\\u00ea for Heraclitus is both air and fire. The fact that psuch\\u00ea can manifest the whole range of physical properties along the dry-wet axis guarantees that souls can show different intellectual and ethical properties as well. Moreover, Sextus Empiricus, supported by some other sources, provides us with an answer how portions of soul stuff are individuated into individual souls. The paper closes with a brief discussion of the question whether, and if so with what qualifications, we can apply the term 'physicalism' to Presocratic theories of the soul.\",\"published_in\":\"Phronesis ; volume 52, issue 1, page 3-32 ; ISSN 0031-8868 1568-5284\",\"year\":\"2007\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophy; History and Philosophy of Science; History\",\"subject\":\"Philosophy; History and Philosophy of Science; History\",\"authors\":\"Betegh, G\\u00e1bor\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/156852807x177931\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"130f5c221212d84e8160c9ee9b97863535bd038412a76da615655252335100cb\",\"relevance\":22},{\"id\":\"2ddb59557150e842c3cca195841cf2fe70d51a50a96f84811ca3c80ca10e8efd\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.poltektegal.ac.id\\/index.php\\/smartcomp\\/article\\/view\\/575\\/496; http:\\/\\/ejournal.poltektegal.ac.id\\/index.php\\/smartcomp\\/article\\/downloadSuppFile\\/575\\/226; 10.30591\\/smartcomp.v6i2.575.g496\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.poltektegal.ac.id\\/index.php\\/smartcomp\\/article\\/view\\/575; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.30591\\/smartcomp.v6i2.575\",\"title\":\"E-COMMERCE PADA SPORT STUFF CENTER BANJARHARJO\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Dalam dunia usaha khususnya dalam hal pemasaran, internet merupakan salah satu teknologi informasi media pemasaran yang bersifat global, karenanya internet sangat dibutuhkan oleh para pengusaha sebagai media dalam menjalankan bisnis.

When it comes to practical attempts to operationalise sustainable development, however, the \\u2018social stuff\\u2019 is often neglected. In this paper, we provide a detailed exploration of how the concept of social sustainability is operationalised (and therefore understood) within the aquaculture certification context. We found that a) certification schemes do address social sustainability, but relevant indicators mostly focus on workers\\u2019 rights, or link directly back to environmental sustainability (through the consequences of environmental impact on humans); and b) the actions required often add little over and above existing legal requirements. Essentially, aquaculture sustainability certification schemes have not (yet) taken the opportunity to further shape our understanding of what social sustainability means, or how it is practiced. The consequence of this may be the impression that industries are truly sustainable, just because they have obtained sustainability certification.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"social sustainability; aquaculture; certification; social Indicators\",\"subject\":\"social sustainability; aquaculture; certification; social Indicators\",\"authors\":\"Alexander, KA; Amundsen, VS; Osmundsen, TC\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.utas.edu.au\\/33571\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"cb586d945653d97e31975a37dcac01404a14751f2d7a05d243a0ae2f982f6405\",\"relevance\":19},{\"id\":\"9748400c26bfe227286c87a2b5cb1c09bb4e3dbf187199c821a65bcc3a55f7fd\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/files.cultural-intertexts.webnode.com\\/200000289-14f2814f2b\\/56-65%20Gheorghiu%20-%20Documentary%20Theatre%20as%20Dissidence%20%E2%80%93%20Textuality%20of%20World%20Politics%20in%20David%20Hare-s%20History%20Play%20Stuff%20Happens.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2393-0624; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2393-1078; 2393-0624; 2393-1078; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/0e0227fe733d4f9e94fdcdbd129b7bb2\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/0e0227fe733d4f9e94fdcdbd129b7bb2\",\"title\":\"Documentary Theatre as Dissidence: Textuality of World Politics in David Hare\\u201fs History Play Stuff Happens\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In an age of manipulation through text and image, when television and the internet have seized representation and forwarded it as truth, political fiction struggles to remain a significant conveyor and commenter of information.

Hare\\u201fs play blurs the relation between factuality and representation. The aim of the present paper is to disclose this strategy by analysing the discursive practice at work within the literary text.\",\"published_in\":\"Cultural Intertexts, Vol 5, Iss 5, Pp 56-65 (2016)\",\"year\":\"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"political play; bush administration; war on terror; discursive practices; reality and fiction; Philology.

When it comes to practical attempts to operationalise sustainable development, however, the social stuff is often neglected. In this paper, we provide a detailed exploration of how the concept of social sustainability is operationalised (and therefore understood) within the aquaculture certification context. We found that a) certification schemes do address social sustainability, but relevant indicators mostly focus on workers rights, or link directly back to environmental sustainability (through the consequences of environmental impact on humans); and b) the actions required often add little over and above existing legal requirements. Essentially, aquaculture sustainability certification schemes have not (yet) taken the opportunity to further shape our understanding of what social sustainability means, or how it is practiced. The consequence of this may be the impression that industries are truly sustainable, just because they have obtained sustainability certification.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Studies in Human Society; Sociology; Environmental Sociology\",\"subject\":\"Studies in Human Society; Sociology; Environmental Sociology\",\"authors\":\"Alexander, KA; Amundsen, VS; Osmundsen, TC\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.envsci.2020.06.003\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"5ff4483d8292375dfdc114660990f945719b3a110586330e9158b698d9f069b6\",\"relevance\":15},{\"id\":\"f6e9cc2705557d1e27281a49d1de605047811d948eca5460fa457e8510975f9a\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.rta.lv\\/index.php\\/ETR\\/article\\/view\\/1859\\/1867\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.rta.lv\\/index.php\\/ETR\\/article\\/view\\/1859; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17770\\/etr1997vol1.1859\",\"title\":\"EXTRACTION OF CRISTOBALITE FROM MILKY-WHITE FORMS OF QUARTZ STUFF1\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Natural quartz is one of die main sources of getting a unique material - quartz glass.

Moreover, rating systems score both building-related tasks with long lifetime expectancies and system-related tasks with short lifetime expectancies without separating them. Therefore, passive solar and bio-climatic architectures, which have long lifetime expectancies and thus have a strong, negative impact on the environment, are neglected. The main goal of this study is to explore differences in total environmental impact for a single \\u201ctypical\\u201d building module (with the heavy wall building technology accepted in Israel) in terms of six different lifetime shearing layers, Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff, each of which reflects a different form of environmental damage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the six shearing layers using life cycle assessment (LCA) by applying Eco-indicator 99 (EI99). It was found that the environmental damage associated with the Building layers (Site, Structure, and Skin) was higher than that associated with the Service layers (Services, Space Plan, and Stuff). The paper may contribute to the development of a more scientific (quantitative) background for green rating systems. As a result, a greater decrease in building-related ecological impacts can be achieved, thus encouraging sustainable building activities.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Green Building ; volume 10, issue 2, page 198-214 ; ISSN 1552-6100 1943-4618\",\"year\":\"2015\",\"subject_orig\":\"Geography, Planning and Development; General Environmental Science\",\"subject\":\"Geography, Planning and Development; General Environmental Science\",\"authors\":\"Pushkar, Svetlana\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.3992\\/jgb.10.2.198\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"7217fcb6bf05db7c61e69d3083b4d4b5ab1ed22cee1df198511656c7fd742220\",\"relevance\":12},{\"id\":\"8619c9ecd48fb4a5f2f9c14da49a4febc724e5dfbf4abedd523f3b82762c0b98\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\\/portal\\/en\\/publications\\/i-dont-get-this-climate-stuff(9a37951a-fe7f-4dae-8b82-2b54790b6a2c).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0963662514565332; http:\\/\\/www.scopus.com\\/inward\\/record.url?scp=84943243799&partnerID=8YFLogxK\",\"title\":\"\\u2018I don\\u2019t get this climate stuff!\\u2019:Making sense of climate change among the corporate middle class in Lagos\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Public engagement continues to be central to wider efforts to address climate change.

The clothes she finds therein are the stuff of dreams for any fashion enthusiast, as is the store itself, a dim, forgotten place where garments are concealed like buried treasure under layers of dust, and where the author herself drifts into a state of semi-consciousness. What Hattemer-Higgins describes is the sensual pleasure of finding beautiful clothes, and the future self that she imagines being when she wears them. This article considers the relationship between the garments we wear and the selves we imagine into them in trying them on, buying them, and wearing them in every day life. These modalities are explored through a phenomenological discussion of dress, with reference to Hattemer-Higgins\\u2019s essay as well as my own lived experience of dressing.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-03\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fashion History & Theory; Philosophy\",\"subject\":\"Fashion History & Theory; Philosophy\",\"authors\":\"Findlay, Rosie\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk\\/9758\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"6741dc9075c58741d3409098a8d46c04520d191f96c11cd17e7334fb88bed179\",\"relevance\":7},{\"id\":\"615ad100d5ff131f42d9004383ea88252e1f5a4612c6ead5beec7d78a7b0996c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.neuroquantology.com\\/index.php\\/journal\\/article\\/view\\/49\\/49\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.neuroquantology.com\\/index.php\\/journal\\/article\\/view\\/49; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14704\\/nq.2004.2.3.49\",\"title\":\"Emergence and Organization Towards a Taxonomy of Organizing Relations\",\"paper_abstract\":\"There are effectively two classes of explanations for how we come to be conscious, particularly in the sense of having a \\u201cmental world\\u201d or apprehending and comprehending phenomenal experience of both the material world in which we are present, and the worlds of our imagination.

Aristotle does indeed describe certain things as extended, movable, and corporeal: for example, the five elements, earth, water, air, fire, and ether, as well as everything made out of them. He also has the concept of a material cause, that is, the raw materials out of which something can be made or generated, and he makes frequent use of this concept in his analysis of perceptible substances. Still, the fact that Aristotle thought about what perceptible substances are made of is insufficient evidence for attributing to him the concept of matter as physical stuff. In addition, we would want to know whether he thought that all perceptible substances are extended, movable, and corporeal precisely because they are made out of matter, and whether any aspect of their behavior is to be explained simply by virtue of their nature as material objects.\",\"published_in\":\"Canadian Journal of Philosophy ; volume 31, issue 1, page 85-111 ; ISSN 0045-5091 1911-0820\",\"year\":\"2001\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophy\",\"subject\":\"Philosophy\",\"authors\":\"Byrne, Christopher\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1080\\/00455091.2001.10717561\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"ccba9fc7c0cc2e94d17a83e5d794697d358236da9c4501a34aca3e19f07dccf4\",\"relevance\":4},{\"id\":\"89ba2356e68a4db05c85658b6fb63398ece0fef621435d898100fbe5053e8b40\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/apo.org.au\\/node\\/16601\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/apo.org.au\\/node\\/16601\",\"title\":\"Cloud atlas\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Once, your computer was a box you loaded with stuff that you had to buy and maintain.

This article explores current thinking about policy learning and transfer, using recent work on the 'Americanisation' of UK active labour market policies as a focus of discussion. While it is clear that the UK has learned from the US in certain respects, academic debates about the US-UK policy relationship are marked by accounts of learning and transfer that depend on a highly rational interpretation of these processes. The article reviews current debates in the policy transfer literature and applies a critical view of policy learning and transfer to key accounts of labour market activation policies before moving on to consider how useful the concept of policy transfer really is in an increasingly complex, plural and 'de-institutionalising' world.

The evidence suggests that MNEs engaged in both union suppression and union substitution strategies by (i) exploiting young employees' apathy to promote opposition and indifference for union organisation (evil stuff), (ii) implementing union member-centred employee retrenchment (fear stuff), (iii) using enterprise-level collective bargaining arrangement to suppress union bargaining power (fear and fatal stuff), (iv) exploiting the fragmented labour union environment to suppress union organisation (fatal and evil stuff) and (v) promoting individual employee voice and involvement mechanisms (sweet stuff). Although MNEs in Ghana engaged in both union suppression and union substitution strategies, they appear to particularly favour the adoption of 'union suppression' strategies and what might be termed as 'corridor tactics'.

Indriyasana Kindergarten Babadan is a school that uses educational game stuff as one of the learning media. It is required to continually maintain this educational game stuff including its storage in order to enhance this learning method. However, there is a problem faced by Indriyasana Kindergarten Babadan that is the school does not have cupboards to keep its educational game stuff. This community service program implements ergonomic scientific\\/field to design a cupboard to keep educational game stuff based on anthropometry of teachers in Indriyasana Kindergarten Babadan. The result of this program was to design three kinds of cupboards.

Capillary marketing is one of the most influential techniques in the issue of more sales in organizations especially in terms of selling food stuff. Food stuff should be sold in a short time due to the short durability. People who make better use of capillary marketing to supply their products and services can sell better and faster. Dependency of Iran's economy on oil incomes and affectability of such incomes from political, economic and international issues cause vulnerability and fragility of the economy. One of the ways of coping with this situation is developing new products that improves inland economic condition and causes an increase in non oil exports. Meanwhile, in addition to the role of food stuff in inland economic development, it can have a determining role in non oil export. Most of the families don't have financial ability to respond steamy needs of their children. Such children are just happy with watching colorful food and being influenced by messages they don't tend to traditional food. In fact, advertisements tell children what to wear play and eat. In this study we are going to discuss marketing of children's food stuff and its advertising methods in Iran.

Its products are also aiming to be viscerally equivalent in terms of their meatlike taste, texture, and overall sensory experience. These alternative proteins (APs) are not, however, intended merely as a substitute for conventional meat. Instead they are viewed and marketed by their developers as meat, made simply from a different raw material and via different methods. Yet as animal meat has become increasingly linked with environmental, health, and ethical concerns, Beyond Meat is having to negotiate a careful balance between positioning its products as meatlike in some respects and not meatlike in others in order to gain consumer adoption. To become \\u201cmeat\\u201d in consumer thinking not only depends on the things these APs are made of\\u2014both material and ideological\\u2014but also the things that are actively excluded; as such, their materiality is made of purposefully chosen \\u201cstuff\\u201d and \\u201cnon-stuff.\\u201d The article explores this decision making via my fieldwork encounters with Beyond Meat\\u2019s products. Using a visceral-autoethnographic approach, I discuss how certain (non)stuff was \\u201cmade to matter and not matter\\u201d (Evans and Miele 2012) to me during these encounters, and how this careful balancing of stuff can create new and problematic imaginaries, moral politics, and misguided understandings of what constitutes \\u201cbetter\\u201d foods and \\u201cbetter\\u201d eaters.

In those formative years of aviation and jet development, designers and pilots did not have the same design understanding and knowledge that we have today. In addition, they did not have the same understanding and knowledge of Systems Safety engineering and Human Factors expertise that we have today. Manned suborbital flights of today should be undertaken in vehicles that have been designed effectively with appropriately derived safety requirements including fault-tolerance, safe life and design-for-minimum risk approaches \\u2013 and all to an acceptable level of safety. Therefore, although initial suborbital pilots will originate from flight test schools and still possess similar traits to their earlier test pilot brethren, they should be protected by the right (safe) thing by design and analysis rather than rely on the right stuff due to ineffective design and operating procedures. The paper presents a review of the SpaceShip2 accident as a case study to highlight the right (safe) things that should be considered in the design, analysis and operations for suborbital operators. The authors of this paper contend that suborbital piloted vehicles should be designed with the knowledge and understanding and lessons learned from those early X-plane flights, lessons learned from general space safety, lessons learned from pilot Human Factors\\/ Crew Resource Management training and by understanding that safety management and safety engineering are essential disciplines that should be integrated with the design team from the concept phase.

The tragic consequences of this war led many writers around the world to question the policy of the United States and its manipulation of facts to justify their narratives. The present study examines the American policy of invading Iraq in David Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens. It investigates Hare\\u2019s technique of combining documentary realism with imaginative reconstruction of the arguments to dramatize the American Invasion of Iraq. Stuff Happens is a historical and political play written as a verbatim theatre. It depicts the backroom deals and political maneuvers of the Bush administration in justifying their campaign against the \\u2018Axis of Evil\\u2019 culminated by the war against Iraq. The verbatim theatre is the best way of showing the gap between \\u2018what is said and what is seen to be done\\u2019. Scenes of direct speeches by real characters are part of this theatre dramatized to present a new reading of a historical event. In addition, characterization is used by Hare\\u2019s to chronicle the American war on Iraq. The study follows a postcolonial framework. The study concludes that Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens succeeded in shaking the public opinion with the truth that Bush\\u2019s administration has manipulated facts in order to achieve their colonial and imperial interests in Iraq, which led to more destruction and violence in this country.

The wastewater can be characterized as a highly variable, highly colored wastewater. A biological wastewater treatment plant uses a natural biological process-metabolism, to destroy waste organic matter. The most important parameter in the Arthur Operation Strategy is \\u201dtreatment time\\u201d. The main purpose of this research is to evaluate the treatability-toxicity of the dye stuff and paper wastewater by using the Arthur Instrument. This work points out that changes in degrees of treatability, due to changes in substance of samples, were shown by developing reaction rate and oxygen volume consumption graphs. These graphs were developed from the data obtained from a series of tests at various samples to activated sludge. In this research the important point was that the toxins were tested using the mixed liquor from dye stuff and paper industry giving us a direct indication of the toxic effect and an actual measurement of the treatment time. Based entirety on biological measurements, we have an actual message of the length of time it takes for the microbes in dye stuff and paper industry to treat the waste coming into aeration basin. Finally, this paper shows that the best treatment process for dye stuff and paper industry is two-stage activated carbon sludge process. \\u751f\\u7269\\u8655\\u7406; Arthur\\u5100\\u5668; \\u6d3b\\u6027\\u78b3\\u6ce5; \\u8655\\u7406\\u505c\\u7559\\u6642\\u9593; \\u56de\\u6536\\u518d\\u5229\\u7528; Arthur Instrument; Reaction Rate; Microbe; Biodegradable; Activated Carbon Sludge; Treatment Time; Dye Stuff  \\u937e\\u5ef6\\u6625; \\u8a31\\u5609\\u5f70; \\u738b\\u4fe1\\u6613\"},{\"id\":\"8868b493b3ca743a43dc30529bda01c336a5c7bc63577aed47deebca17d2f197\",\"content\":\"Genomic stuff:Governing the (im)matter of life Emphasizing the context of what has often been referred to as \\\"scarce natural resources\\\", in particular forests, meadows, and fishing stocks, Elinor Ostrom's important works, including Governing the commons (1990) and Understanding institutional diversity (2005), present an institutional framework for discussing the development and use of collective action with respect to environmental problems. In this article we discuss extensions of Ostrom's approach to human genes and genomes and explore its limits and usefulness in this field. We argue that while there are radically different contexts and cases and governance regimes still to be debated, what we call \\\"genomic stuff\\\"-genomic material, data, and information-often can best be regulated by modes of stewardship and self-regulation of appropriators. We exemplify this claim by a discussion of gene patenting, the \\\"Genome War\\\", and the so-called HapMap project. The issue of how to best govern the genomic stuff of humans, we suggest, is complicated by the situation that the appropriator and the appropriated can be the same, inviting fundamental questions about politics and ethics.

Its products are also aiming to be viscerally equivalent in terms of their meatlike taste, texture, and overall sensory experience. These alternative proteins (APs) are not, however, intended merely as a substitute for conventional meat. Instead they are viewed and marketed by their developers as meat, made simply from a different raw material and via different methods. Yet as animal meat has become increasingly linked with environmental, health, and ethical concerns, Beyond Meat is having to negotiate a careful balance between positioning its products as meatlike in some respects and not meatlike in others in order to gain consumer adoption. To become \\u201cmeat\\u201d in consumer thinking not only depends on the things these APs are made of\\u2014both material and ideological\\u2014but also the things that are actively excluded; as such, their materiality is made of purposefully chosen \\u201cstuff\\u201d and \\u201cnon-stuff.\\u201d The article explores this decision-making via my fieldwork encounters with Beyond Meat's products. Using a visceral-autoethnographic approach, I discuss how certain (non)stuff was \\u201cmade to matter and not matter\\u201d (Evans and Miele 2012) to me during these encounters, and how this careful balancing of stuff can create new and problematic imaginaries, moral politics, and misguided understandings of what constitutes \\u201cbetter\\u201d foods and \\u201cbetter\\u201d eaters. The observations made contribute to existing discussions on visceral methodologies, perceptions of (novel) foods, embodied consumption practices, and the ways in which bodies are made as eaters and things as food.

Their physics is encoded in the higher n-point functions of the conformal theory. We study inclusive processes and argue that the inclusive production of unparticle stuff in standard model processes due to the unparticle self-interactions can be decomposed using the conformal partial wave expansion and its generalizations into a sum over contributions from the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff, corresponding to different primary conformal operators. Such processes typically involve the production of unparticle stuff associated with operators other than those to which the standard model couples directly. Thus just as interactions between particles allow scattering processes to produce new particles in the final state, so unparticle self-interactions cause the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff. We discuss both inclusive and exclusive methods for computing these processes. The resulting picture, we believe, is a step towards understanding what unparticle stuff \\u201clooks like\\u201d because it is quite analogous to way we describe the production and scattering of ordinary particles in quantum field theory, with the primary conformal operators playing the role of particles and the coefficients in the conformal partial wave expansion (and its generalization to include more fields) playing the role of amplitudes. We exemplify our methods in the 2D toy model that we discussed previously in which the Banks-Zaks theory is exactly solvable. ; Physics   Georgi, Howard; Kats, Yevgeny\"},{\"id\":\"60822a22ab3f64a634a81a5ed297609734e5f07125780c9dcf587f1bfbad1e17\",\"content\":\"THE RIGHT STUFF: From Western to melodrama and comedy THE RIGHT STUFF (1983), directed by Philip Kaufman, has explored which genre conventions were appropriate for space travel. The film first uses the Hollywood Western, as has been acknowledged by several authors. However, the film also uses other genres, particularly melodrama and comedy as described by Stanley Cavell. In general, film genres help us understand the world. More specifically, the Hollywood Western is the film\\u2019s point of departure for its depiction of the astronaut\\u2019s immediate predecessor \\u2013 the test pilot; yet it is the family melodrama and the comedy that should be acknowledged as more important for understanding the astronaut as the test pilot\\u2019s successor. To be precise, understanding the history of space travel in terms of Hollywood genres requires an examination of the way in which THE RIGHT STUFF has marked the transition from a covert, military operation (test pilots) to a civilian public relations project (astronauts) as the succession of the Western by the family melodrama and the comedy of remarriage. comedy of remarriage; film genre; space travel; melodrama; Western; Filmgenre; Raumfahrt; Melodram; ddc:791; THE RIGHT STUFF Staat, Wim (2016): THE RIGHT STUFF: From Western to melodrama and comedy.

Superflab, Super Stuff pink wax and Paraffin wax bolus materials are used with 15MeV electron energy for dosimetric comparison. Additionally, 10 mm thick Super Stuff pink wax bolus and paraffin wax bolus materials were placed on the right eyelid of a patient. Using electron dose calculation algorithm and ion chamber measurements, dosimetric comparisons were made in the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Both for measured and calculated dose, values were acquired 3 times and averaged for each case. Resulting differences are expressed as percentage differences. Dose differences were obtained in measurements with and without using bolus at several locations of the solid phantom, performed by the Roos Ion chamber. Dosimetric differences of 7-7.5% for Superflab, 10-10.5% for paraffin bolus and 13-14% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus are obtained. Besides, when dosimetric comparisons are made in the treatment planning system for cases with and without bolus; Dose differences were calculated to be 2-2.5% for superflab silicon bolus, 3-3.5% for paraffin wax bolus and 5-6% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus. To increase skin dose in curved anatomical structures in radiotherapy, it is safe to use the paraffin wax bolus material in radiotherapy clinic, as an alternative to Superflab silicon bolus and Super Stuff pink wax bolus materials, due to its low cost and ease of conforming to body surface contours.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the \\\"Law of the few\\\", the \\\"Stickiness factor\\\", and the \\\"Power of context\\\". For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as \\\"interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks\\\", for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.

The tragic consequences of this war led many writers around the world to question the policy of the United States and its manipulation of facts to justify their narratives. The present study examines the American policy of invading Iraq in David Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens . It investigates Hare\\u2019s technique of combining documentary realism with imaginative reconstruction of the arguments to dramatize the American Invasion of Iraq. Stuff Happens is a historical and political play written as a verbatim theatre. It depicts the backroom deals and political maneuvers of the Bush administration in justifying their campaign against the \\u2018Axis of Evil\\u2019 culminated by the war against Iraq. The verbatim theatre is the best way of showing the gap between \\u2018what is said and what is seen to be done\\u2019. Scenes of direct speeches by real characters are part of this theatre dramatized to present a new reading of a historical event. In addition, characterization is used by Hare\\u2019s to chronicle the American war on Iraq. The study follows a postcolonial framework. The study concludes that Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens succeeded in shaking the public opinion with the truth that Bush\\u2019s administration has manipulated facts in order to achieve their colonial and imperial interests in Iraq, which led to more destruction and violence in this country.

His reasons are persuasive. First, it provides a rich vein of initial stimulus material to tap, helping us to engage and intrigue even our least motivated learners. Second, it allows students to construct layers of meaning that might escape them purely through the written word. Students often find it easier to \\u2018read\\u2019 the tone of a source by listening to it and this can be a powerful way to consider perspective. Third, the use of this type of music supports close textual analysis, providing ways of exploring the lyrics at different levels. Finally, it helps us to pose rigorous historical questions about significance and interpretation. Enquiries that explore why people still sing about the Diggers and what impact Billie Holliday\\u2019s songs had on the Civil Rights movement provide students with both challenge and motivation. They also provide teachers with imaginative ways to combine depth and overview in their planning. L Education (General); LB1603 Secondary Education.

Hence, the English contemporary political theatre has displayed unique interconnectedness between drama and politics: interest in US-Iraq war is indeed not an exception. British playwright, David Hare, belongs to a trend of war drama that enables the world to witness the truth, trauma and the violence of US-Iraq war. Stuff Happens subtly helps show how US coercive diplomacy manipulates other Powers to fulfill the new doctrine of \\\" New American Century.\\\" In Stuff Happens, Hare documents the recent tragic history of Iraq in such an approach that blends the documentary with the fictional to display the events from 2000, till the actual invasion of Iraq in April, 2003. The play traces the origins of US-Iraq war and unveils all the attempts and the procedures undertaken by Bush and his administration team to invade Iraq.

Mimesis and (the end of) magic in Walter Benjamin The paper focuses on the quite famous but also still quite mysterious idea of \\u201cimmaterial similarity\\u201d (or more literally \\u201cnonsensous similarity\\u201d) by Walter Benjamin. Benjamin argues that the production of an immaterial similarity is in some way an act of magic. But it is also at the same time an overcoming of magic itself. And the reason is that the \\u201cimmaterial similarity\\u201d can open the way to a \\u201cmaterialistic perspective\\u201d. How can that be? In order to answer, we\\u2019ll consider Benjamin\\u2019s idea of \\u201cmatter\\u201d. In Benjamin\\u2019s early writings matter (Materie) appears, as we shall see, as something magic. But there is another idea, which is quite near to matter but is not exactly the same: the idea of \\u201cstuff\\u201d (Stoff). The stuff is the \\u201cmaterial\\u201d things are made of. If we search for a definition of it, we can find that it is \\u201cthe mute, soft and flocky element that \\u2013 like the snow in the snow globes \\u2013 clouds over inside the core of things\\u201d. We are going to examine this problematic definition. We\\u2019ll discover that way that the idea of stuff marks, in comparison to matter, a possibility.

Whilst dance is known as a feminine activity, males tend to be even more in the minority in more \\u2018feminised\\u2019 genres, such as ballet. However, in other genres, such as street dance, which allows them to conform to a more traditionally masculine identity, they are in the majority. Regardless of genre, however, males are more often found in positions of power within the dance-performer\\u2019s world compared to their female counterparts. Dance teachers clearly have an important role to play in dance students\\u2019 perceptions of gendered (in)equalities within the dance world, where the majority of dance teachers are female. To date, however, their perceptions have been under-researched. To address this research gap, 10 female professional dance teachers, ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, were interviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis through the theoretical lens of symbolic interactionism. Two salient themes were identified: coolness and masculinity, and male privilege. Participants perceived that gender inequalities did exist within dance genres and in the opportunities afforded to male and female dancers. These inequalities appeared to lead to a greater valorisation of male dancers in terms of physical and psychological characteristics. The perceptions of female dance teachers in general are important in relation to the socialisation of future dance professionals.

According to his patent, 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde is an anti-tumor agent without any sideeffects. My impression is that this stuff is capable of preventing carcinogenesis when used quantitatively sufficiently. In order to treat developed cancers, you ought to start giving your cancer patient a small dose of the stuff because, otherwise, the patient may suffer from a serious hemorrhage of the tumor caused by excessive necroses. Therefore, lymphomas and leukemias can be treated more easily because these tumors have no blood vessels. Consequently, those who have these diseases can receive considerably large dose of the stuff anti-tumor agent; lymphomas and leukemias; carcinogenesis  Okazaki K\"},{\"id\":\"ca47d43ebde31b728f6c203a33b4a9845db0d310528d9b30ec1cdb9aad00f350\",\"content\":\"\\u77f3\\u8111\\u6cb9\\u88c2\\u89e3\\u8fc7\\u7a0b\\u4e2d\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u53cd\\u5e94\\u9009\\u62e9\\u6027\\u7cfb\\u6570\\u7684\\u8c03\\u6574\\u65b9\\u6cd5\\u7814\\u7a76 ; Investigating of adjusting method on selectivities of the first-order reaction in naphtha pyrolysis \\u5728\\u5206\\u6790\\u77f3\\u8111\\u6cb9\\u88c2\\u89e3\\u7089\\u8f90\\u5c04\\u6bb5\\u7684kuMAr\\u5206\\u5b50\\u53cd\\u5e94\\u52a8\\u529b\\u5b66\\u6a21\\u578b\\u7684\\u57fa\\u7840\\u4e0a,\\u63d0\\u51fa\\u4e86\\u4e00\\u79cd\\u5e94\\u7528\\u6570\\u636e\\u878d\\u5408\\u6280\\u672f\\u5bf9kuMAr\\u6a21\\u578b\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u53cd\\u5e94\\u9009\\u62e9\\u6027\\u7cfb\\u6570\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5728\\u7ebf\\u8c03\\u6574\\u7684\\u65b9\\u6cd5\\u3002\\u9996\\u5148,\\u5229\\u7528\\u8fdb\\u5316\\u7684\\u9057\\u4f20\\u7b97\\u6cd5,\\u4ee5\\u6539\\u8fdb\\u7684\\u77f3\\u8111\\u6cb9\\u88c2\\u89e3\\u6a21\\u578b\\u8ba1\\u7b97\\u51fa\\u7684\\u4ea7\\u7387\\u4e0e\\u5b9e\\u9645\\u5de5\\u51b5\\u4ea7\\u7387\\u7684\\u8bef\\u5dee\\u4f5c\\u4e3a\\u76ee\\u6807\\u51fd\\u6570,\\u5bf9\\u9009\\u62e9\\u6027\\u7cfb\\u6570\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u79bb\\u7ebf\\u8c03\\u6574,\\u8fdb\\u800c\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u539f\\u6599\\u6027\\u8d28\\u4e0e\\u9009\\u62e9\\u6027\\u7cfb\\u6570\\u76f8\\u5339\\u914d\\u7684\\u6807\\u51c6\\u6837\\u672c\\u6570\\u636e\\u5e93\\u3002\\u5176\\u6b21,\\u5229\\u7528\\u6570\\u636e\\u878d\\u5408\\u6280\\u672f\\u4e2d\\u7684dEMPETEr-SHAfEr\\u8bc1\\u636e\\u7406\\u8bba\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u6a21\\u578b,\\u8ba1\\u7b97\\u5f85\\u4f30\\u7269\\u6599\\u4e0e\\u6807\\u51c6\\u6837\\u672c\\u6570\\u636e\\u5e93\\u4e2d\\u6837\\u672c\\u7269\\u6599\\u7684\\u5339\\u914d\\u5ea6,\\u8fdb\\u800c\\u5bf9\\u5f85\\u4f30\\u539f\\u6599\\u7684\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u53cd\\u5e94\\u9009\\u62e9\\u6027\\u7cfb\\u6570\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u4f30\\u7b97\\u3002\\u7814\\u7a76\\u7ed3\\u679c\\u8868\\u660e,\\u5229\\u7528\\u4f30\\u7b97\\u51fa\\u7684\\u4e00\\u6b21\\u53cd\\u5e94\\u9009\\u62e9\\u6027\\u7cfb\\u6570\\u5efa\\u7acb\\u7684\\u88c2\\u89e3\\u5de5\\u827a\\u6a21\\u578b\\u5177\\u6709\\u8f83\\u9ad8\\u7cbe\\u5ea6,\\u5c06\\u4eff\\u771f\\u7ed3\\u679c\\u4e0e\\u5b9e\\u9645\\u5de5\\u51b5\\u4ea7\\u7387\\u8fdb\\u884c\\u5bf9\\u6bd4,\\u8bc1\\u5b9e\\u4e86\\u8be5\\u65b9\\u6cd5\\u7684\\u6709\\u6548\\u6027\\u548c\\u53ef\\u884c\\u6027\\u3002 ; On the analysis of the Kumar's kinetic model of naphtha pyrolysis furnace,on-line adjustment method based by the data fusion theory for the selectivity of the first-order reaction of the Kumar's model is proposed.Firstly,the improved genetic algorithm is used to realize the off-line adjustment of the selectivity of the first-order reaction,and the sample database is constituted by the property of stuff and the selectivity depending on the property of stuff.Secondly,an on-line method for estimating of the selectivity of the first-order reaction for the new property of stuff is presented by the Dempeter-Shafer evidential theory.The effective and validity of the provided method is testified by the simulating result. ; \\u4e2d\\u592e\\u9ad8\\u6821\\u57fa\\u672c\\u79d1\\u7814\\u4e1a\\u52a1\\u8d39\\u4e13\\u9879\\u8d44\\u91d1\\u8d44\\u52a9(2010121047) \\u77f3\\u8111\\u6cb9; \\u88c2\\u89e3; \\u9009\\u62e9\\u6027\\u7cfb\\u6570; \\u9057\\u4f20\\u7b97\\u6cd5; \\u6570\\u636e\\u878d\\u5408; naphtha; pyrolysis; selectivity; genetic algorithm; data integration  \\u7a0b\\u7855; \\u5468\\u534e; \\u5e08\\u4f73; \\u6c5f\\u9752\\u8335; \\u66f9\\u5fd7\\u51ef\"},{\"id\":\"2966f32135745ebb64ddb8c8b77e4bbd9a821323add23fc7b9686e3704e1bb1d\",\"content\":\"Between the mundane and the exotic: time for a different sociotechnical stuff This article examines the relation of technology to temporality. Exotic technologies - iconically information and communication technologies and biotechnologies - typically evoke change and the novel character of the present epoch. Yet these enter a world of mundane technologies that putatively serve merely in social reproduction. It is argued that such a stark contrast is untenable. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres, the temporality of technology is re-conceived in terms of patterns of order\\/disorder to which both exotic and mundane technologies contribute. The minimal parameters needed to articulate the nature of such a complexly temporalized sociotechnical stuff are outlined.

This dilemma can be avoided if objects truly have vague boundaries. It is metaphysically impossible for an entity with a vague boundary to be embedded within an entity of the same kind. A cloud's parts (that is, cloud stuff) cannot be clearly embedded within the vague boundary region of another cloud, for the latter region is defined as possessing neither cloud-stuff nor non-cloud-stuff. Likewise, there cannot be a cloud with a vague boundary embedded in the middle of another cloud because there would then have to be a population of water droplets dense enough to compose part of the larger cloud which was nevertheless insufficient in density to compose part of the embedded cloud.

Characterized as a kind of intermediate stuff, the apeiron turns out to consist of contraries and as such is impossible. Commentators have rightly noted this point and some have also indicated that Aristotle offers an argument of sorts for his negative estimate. However, the argument has received scant attention, and it is fair to say that it remains unclear exactly why Aristotle rejects Anaximander\\u2019s intermediate stuff. Indeed, it is unclear how Aristotle\\u2019s argument is supposed to run in the first place. This paper offers a reconstruction of Aristotle\\u2019s argument for the impossibility of the apeiron , and on this basis offers to explain Aristotle\\u2019s grounds for rejecting Anaximander\\u2019s intermediate stuff. This is especially called for in light of the fact that Aristotle himself thinks that there can be intermediate stuffs. Finally, some attention is given to the parallel between the apeiron and Aristotle\\u2019s prime matter.

We pose a number of questions: how do inhabitants and their media stuff adapt to the more rigid physical spaces of a building? How does the building respond to the more rapid changes to dwelling produced by this media stuff? And how are these differing times synchronised? In answer to these questions we present four case studies of homes in Melbourne, Australia, each representative of a particular strategy of synchronisation. They are: the found home, the imagined home, the designed home, and the renovated home. We identify logics informing these homes: the first naturalises the choices made, the second rationalises choices, and the third is one in which dwelling and (re)building are intertwined.

In this article we discuss extensions of Ostroms approach to human genes and genomes and explore its limits and usefulness in this field. We argue that while there are radically different contexts and cases and governance regimes still to be debated, what we call 'genomic stuff' genomic material, data, and information often can best be regulated by modes of stewardship and self-regulation of appropriators. We exemplify this claim by a discussion of gene patenting, the 'Genome War', and the so-called HapMap project. The issue of how to best govern the genomic stuff of humans, we suggest, is complicated by the situation that the appropriator and the appropriated can be the same, inviting fundamental questions about politics and ethics.\\\" global commons; Ostrom; Elinor; governance and politics; Social Organization  P??lsson, G??sli; Prainsack, Barbara\"},{\"id\":\"502e77f10c5e2c7bda2883613c541051d90d04e18eb6bd6a4eba6c13c6fef2b8\",\"content\":\"It turns out the Armoire is your mother: Narratives of addiction in two cable television organization programs Addiction Research & Theory, 14(2): pp. 139-157. ; An ideological analysis was conducted of two cable television programs which offer strategies on how to organize the \\u201cstuff\\u201d accumulated by individuals: Clean Sweep, which airs on the TLC cable channel, and Clean House, which airs on the Style cable channel.

Students\\u2019 perceptions of their skills development Bennett et al. (2000) refer to the notion of \\u2018core skills\\u2019 as an \\u2018unfulfilled concept\\u2019. Thus it is Q1 possible that different interpretations and values at the level of actual degree programmes may be hidden within this term. This study enquires into students\\u2019 tacit notions of skills development within a specific degree programme and at a detailed level of skills description. It finds that students link skills with personal attributes, seeing some skills as arising naturally from personality types or developing naturally as one grows older.

As a National Science Foundation funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, it is part of PCCM\\u2019s mission to inspire and educate school children, teachers and the public about STEM and materials science. Research shows that it is critical to excite students at a young age and maintain that excitement, and without that these, students are two to three times less likely to have any interest in science and engineering and pursue science careers as adults. The Making Stuff TV series offered a great teachable moment in materials science for students and teachers alike. The four episodes, Stronger, Smaller, Smarter and Cleaner aired in January and February, 2011. Our complementary education program helped promote the viewership of the Making Stuff series in the region, and the NOVA episodes helped us by priming the teachers and students to learn more about materials science research conducted at Princeton University. The Making Stuff coalition events we conducted were designed to have the maximum positive impact on students\\u2019 attitudes towards science and scientists, in general, and materials scientists and engineers, specifically. Each and every student had an opportunity to interact with dozens of scientists and engineers, in the lab, at table demonstrations and lecture presentations. As an ongoing MRSEC education and outreach program we have developed many successful educational partnerships to increase our impact. Plus, through years of successful education programs and the participation of our materials scientists and engineers, we have cultivated great trust in the schools and local community. The schools eagerly joined as partners in the program to bring their students to the event. Teachers from those partner schools actively participated in associated professional development programs conducted by education staff and PCCM professors before and after the big event. Included were presentations by MRSEC members and the partners from Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials (PRISM), Princeton University\\u2019s chemistry department, DOE funded centers PP-SOC and PPPL, Liberty Science Center, Franklin Institute, our PBS partner NJN and our many school district partners.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the 'Law of the few' , the 'Stickiness factor' , and the 'Power of context'. For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as 'interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks' , for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.

Drawing on the work of Freire (1972) the paper demonstrates how co-teaching by learning disabled people has a transformative impact on educational experiences.

The paper explains how Bush deals with the opponents\\u2014Colin Powell, the British PM Tony Blair, and Hans Blix\\u2014opposing his decision, based on \\\"fabricated\\\" evidence, by employing his father's strategy of coercive diplomacy against them, depending on both his faith and his position as President. Drawing on a postcolonial approach, the analysis of Hare's piece has demonstrated two significant aspects: 1) Bush, implementing such a strategy of coercive diplomacy, has succeeded in achieving his private agenda in invading Iraq; 2) Hare is possessed of the dramatic dexterity of mixing fiction (the significant roles of the nameless fictional characters as well as the unnamed narrator-actors) with facts (the main figures of politics) for supporting play\\u2019s different conflicts. The present paper has reached a number of findings. First, the US attacked Iraq, for Bush had to show his people some reaction to the 9\\/11 attacks. Second, Bush chose Iraq in particular and not North Korea, for instance, for his personal motives. Third, the US's double standard is stressed through the unresolved Israeli\\/Palestinian conflict negotiated throughout. Fourth, the coercive-diplomacy strategy has always been the US\\u2019s means for (il-) legal ends and, thus, this strategy can be considered a postcolonial construct in Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens .

A close examination of B36, supported by the comparative evidence of some other early theories of the soul, suggests that the word psuch\\u00ea could function as both a mass term and a count noun for Heraclitus. There is a stuff in the world, alongside other physical elements, that manifests mental functions. Humans, and possibly other beings, show mental functions in so far as they have a portion of that stuff. Turning to the physical characterization of the soul, the paper argues that B36 is entirely consistent with the ancient testimonies that say that psuch\\u00ea for Heraclitus is exhalation. But exhalations cover all states of matter from the lowest moist part of atmospheric air to the fire of celestial bodies. If so, psuch\\u00ea for Heraclitus is both air and fire. The fact that psuch\\u00ea can manifest the whole range of physical properties along the dry-wet axis guarantees that souls can show different intellectual and ethical properties as well. Moreover, Sextus Empiricus, supported by some other sources, provides us with an answer how portions of soul stuff are individuated into individual souls. The paper closes with a brief discussion of the question whether, and if so with what qualifications, we can apply the term 'physicalism' to Presocratic theories of the soul.

She is one of the many women whose contribution to history has been occluded despite her theatrical connections (Ellen Terry, Sarah Bernhardt, Edith Craig, No\\u00c3\\u00abl Coward) and remarkable achievements. In addition to these endeavours, Enthoven spent the First World War working for the British Red Cross running the department that logged and collected information on Prisoners of War and Missing Persons (a role she returned to during the Second World War) and she is equally unlikely to be mentioned in any of the events and publications commemorating the war effort.

However, optimisation studies requiring many iterative gait cycle simulations have not yet found widespread application because of their high computational cost. Therefore, a computationally efficient inverse dynamics model of 3D human gait has been designed and compared with an equivalent model, created using a commercial multi-body dynamics package. The fast inverse dynamics model described in this paper led to an eight fold increase in execution speed. Sufficient detail is provided to allow readers to implement the model themselves.

Moreover, rating systems score both building-related tasks with long lifetime expectancies and system-related tasks with short lifetime expectancies without separating them. Therefore, passive solar and bio-climatic architectures, which have long lifetime expectancies and thus have a strong, negative impact on the environment, are neglected. The main goal of this study is to explore differences in total environmental impact for a single \\u201ctypical\\u201d building module (with the heavy wall building technology accepted in Israel) in terms of six different lifetime shearing layers, Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff, each of which reflects a different form of environmental damage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the six shearing layers using life cycle assessment (LCA) by applying Eco-indicator 99 (EI99). It was found that the environmental damage associated with the Building layers (Site, Structure, and Skin) was higher than that associated with the Service layers (Services, Space Plan, and Stuff). The paper may contribute to the development of a more scientific (quantitative) background for green rating systems. As a result, a greater decrease in building-related ecological impacts can be achieved, thus encouraging sustainable building activities.

This study contributes to public engagement debates by investigating engagement with climate change among an often overlooked group, the corporate middle class in Africa\\u2019s second largest megacity, Lagos. Combining survey and interviews, I focus analysis on three aspects: awareness, knowledge and concern; role of scientific and social frames in shaping general attitude; and spatial attribution of causes and consequences. The study reveals a universal awareness and high concern about climate change among the respondents, although understanding and perceptions of climate change are significantly socially framed. Social situatedness, more than scientific facts, is the most important definer of overall engagement with climate change. This study thus underscores a nuanced constructionist stance, showing how corporate professionals\\u2019 \\u2018ways of knowing\\u2019 climate change is underpinned by a certain co-production between scientific and socio-experiential frames.

Antibiotic residues in food stuff cause bacterial resistance, allergic reactions, toxicity, carcinogenic effects and change of natural micro flora of intestine in consumers. So, the aim of the present study is detection of antibiotic residues and its contamination rate in cultured rainbow trout. Four-plate test is one of the microbiological methods of detecting antibiotic residues in food stuff, which is based on inhibition zone formation around the sample in four culture media with different pH and test bacteria. For this purpose, 45 samples from skin and meat of rainbow trout fish were obtained randomly from fish market of Tabriz city. After different phases of four-plate test, from a total of 180 skin samples, 13 cases (7.22%) and from a total of 180 meat samples, 18 cases (10%) were diagnosed to be contaminated to antibiotic residues. The results showed that contamination rate of two tissues, (meat and skin), have no significant difference (P>0.05), and the highest contamination to antibiotic residues were related to penicillin and macrolides groups (P<0.05).

Column chromatographic isolation afforded one main pure compound. Different spectral analyses established the identity of the isolated compound.Results: Chromatographic purification afforded 372 mg (5.2% w\\/w enrichment ratio) of pure needle crystals. Spectral analyses revealed the identity of the isolated compound as the synthetic cannabinoid AB-FUBINACA, confirming the assumption that a synthetic cannabinoid was disguised as an herbal scent product.Conclusion: Several scent herbal products, also known as \\u201cspice\\u201d, are used to disguise synthetic cannabinoids. Their detection proved to be troublesome since authentic standards are not yet available. The synthetic cannabinoid, AB-FUBINACA, was isolated from one of these products, and its identity was established based on its spectral data.

Stag parties have become socially expected as a rite of passage, pre-marriage celebration for men that usually involves excessive alcohol consumption and engagement in deviant, potentially harmful, behaviour. These events produce a shift in time and space, and together with group expectations for celebration, increase the impetus for excessive consumption. Our contention is that excessive consumption of alcohol and deviant behaviour that often takes place are partially rooted in commercial ideology which has become firmly embedded in the attitudes of young British men.

The clothes she finds therein are the stuff of dreams for any fashion enthusiast, as is the store itself, a dim, forgotten place where garments are concealed like buried treasure under layers of dust, and where the author herself drifts into a state of semi-consciousness. What Hattemer-Higgins describes is the sensual pleasure of finding beautiful clothes, and the future self that she imagines being when she wears them. This article considers the relationship between the garments we wear and the selves we imagine into them in trying them on, buying them, and wearing them in every day life. These modalities are explored through a phenomenological discussion of dress, with reference to Hattemer-Higgins\\u2019s essay as well as my own lived experience of dressing.

Aristotle does indeed describe certain things as extended, movable, and corporeal: for example, the five elements, earth, water, air, fire, and ether, as well as everything made out of them. He also has the concept of a material cause, that is, the raw materials out of which something can be made or generated, and he makes frequent use of this concept in his analysis of perceptible substances. Still, the fact that Aristotle thought about what perceptible substances are made of is insufficient evidence for attributing to him the concept of matter as physical stuff. In addition, we would want to know whether he thought that all perceptible substances are extended, movable, and corporeal precisely because they are made out of matter, and whether any aspect of their behavior is to be explained simply by virtue of their nature as material objects.
