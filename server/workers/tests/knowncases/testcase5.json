Design\\/methodology\\/approach This essay weaves together popular press articles, academic writings and the authors' lived experiences to summarize, clarify and extend the work needed inside of organizations and academia to dismantle systemic racism. Findings We define antiracist resources as personal and material assets that counteract systemic racism through informing and equipping antiracist actions, and identify three resources\\u2014adopting a long-term view for learning the history of racism, embracing discomfort to acknowledge racist mistakes and systematically assess how organizational structures maintain white supremacy\\u2014for organizations to address systemic racism. Research limitations\\/implications While there is a critical need for more antiracism research, there are standards and guidelines that should be followed to conduct that research responsibly with antiracism enacted in research design, methodology decisions and publication practices. Practical implications The authors call for organizations to directly counter-racism via antiracism resources and offer examples for how these resources can inform and equip companies to create equitable workplaces.

Systemic racism, practiced through institutionalized policies and customary behaviour affecting people working in organizations, results in inequality for some groups and privileges for others. Since 2002 the CAF has been covered by the federal Employment Equity Act whose purpose is to address systemic discrimination by requiring employers to remove and prevent systemic barriers to equality for Indigenous people, women and \\u201cvisible minorities\\u201d and to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the Canadian population. Aside from its legal obligation, it is in the interest of the CAF to recruit and retain Indigenous People because they are an essential part of Canada\\u2019s labour supply. However Indigenous members of the CAF comprise a small and marginalized minority within a rigid, bureaucratic and culturally foreign organization.Implementing the Employment Equity Act could assist the CAF to address the Canadian state\\u2019s promise of reconciliation, fairness and equality for Indigenous people. This chapter reviews available evidence bearing on the CAF\\u2019s employment equity record, which presents a pattern of resistance to the Act\\u2019s requirements and failure to progress toward a representative workforce. In the absence of effective action to implement change, the CAF has yet to find a path from systemic racism toward employment equity for Indigenous People.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Military and Strategic Studies; Vol 19 No 2 (2018) ; 1488-559X\",\"year\":\"2019-02-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Agocs, Carol\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/jmss.org\\/article\\/view\\/62832\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8bb7e92184da939b857a68d9719f0b81bdd2d5d1ad6d282db99d73f6815e30d7\",\"relevance\":113},{\"id\":\"2004d9120be3bb4a6a10e0d4443961dd6cbd546a28099c13bd0135244abba42e\",\"relation\":\"14020988; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1813\\/73606\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1813\\/73606\",\"title\":\"Racial Disparities and Homelessness in Western New York\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Homeless Alliance of Western New York analyzed racial disparities among homelessness within Western New York and examined the homeless system\\u2019s equity serving different racial\\/ethnic groups in terms of receiving those services, prioritizing those services, and housing success rate. The ideal model for an unbiased homeless system would distribute assistance such that it is received in equal percentages across racial\\/ethnic groups as the percent of that racial group experiencing homelessness. One of the consequences of systemic racism is an overrepresentation of people of color among those who experience homelessness. Black people make up 11% of the general population of Western New York but they account for 25% of the people in poverty and 47% of the homeless population. When the number of people who experience homelessness are compared against the number of people who are in poverty, Black people living in poverty are 3 times more likely to experience homelessness compared to White people. These suggest that poverty rates alone do not explain the over-representation, but that systemic racism blunts the ability of people of color to recover from financial catastrophe to avoid homelessness relative to those who are White. ; wny_racial_disparities_2018.pdf: 20 downloads, before Oct. 1, 2020.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-10-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"housing; neighborhoods; buffalo; poverty; inequality; homelessness\",\"subject\":\"housing; neighborhoods; buffalo; poverty; inequality; homelessness\",\"authors\":\"Homeless Alliance of Western New York\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1813\\/73606\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"2004d9120be3bb4a6a10e0d4443961dd6cbd546a28099c13bd0135244abba42e\",\"relevance\":112},{\"id\":\"053512bfd4c3e9569b324a26ce97d820c1be3e02e2c7387d6a2a64b22b3b314f\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/espace.cdu.edu.au\\/view\\/cdu:8475\",\"title\":\"Experiences of racism among urban Indigenous Australians: findings from the DRUID study\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Although Indigenous people continue to experience racism in contemporary Australian society, we know little about the nature of such experiences.

These statistics represent a clear disparity between whites and African Americans in the criminal justice system and give valid reason to be concerned about the effects of mass incarceration and the war on drugs on African American communities (Bobo and Johnson 2004). This paper will draw from conflict theory to argue that the methods employed to fight the war on drugs in America (whether purposefully or not) work to deplete social welfare of African American communities through the use of discriminatory rhetoric, increasingly harsh and racially targeted policies, and prejudicial enforcement and mobilization of these policies, which reinforce existing systems of control and domination in North American society. Possible strategies that may be implemented to remediate this issue include shifting focus from supply reduction strategies (which mainly function to punish offenders) to demand reduction strategies which aim to persuade people not to use or buy drugs, through education and drug abuse treatment (Tonry 1994:66), including integrated public health-public safety strategies (Marlowe 2003).\",\"published_in\":\"The Sociological Imagination: Undergraduate Journal; Vol 6 No 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-13\",\"subject_orig\":\"war on drugs; racism; systemic racism; justice system; criminal justice system; mass incarceration; drug crime; drug crimes; policing; criminology\",\"subject\":\"war on drugs; racism; systemic racism; justice system; criminal justice system; mass incarceration; drug crime; drug crimes; policing; criminology\",\"authors\":\"Boghosian, Mileva\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.lib.uwo.ca\\/index.php\\/si\\/article\\/view\\/10629\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"e167ac70591530ad6c5e0a528b74ba82901d1786d1320152498c1ddbc413c373\",\"relevance\":101},{\"id\":\"ee935a2b031f184887f4a9d2d6b0dce088915b7870830a5f5cff31a69d847f10\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/reference\\/issn\\/1189-3788; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/reference\\/issn\\/1920-7344; urn:doi:10.4000\\/communication.10766; http:\\/\\/journals.openedition.org\\/communication\\/10766\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.openedition.org\\/communication\\/10766\",\"title\":\"Id\\u00e9ologie raciste et fiction t\\u00e9l\\u00e9visuelle\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Partant du postulat qu\\u2019il existe un racisme syst\\u00e9mique auquel contribuent les m\\u00e9dias, l\\u2019auteure explore les modalit\\u00e9s de mat\\u00e9rialisation de l\\u2019id\\u00e9ologie raciste dans la fiction s\\u00e9rielle espagnole.

Africana people have made strides at all levels of the American government. Africana people were a vital voting block that helped to elect the first American President of African descent. However, studies have shown that the conditions of Africana people in America have not substantially changed since the Voting Rights Act of 1 965 was enacted. Africana political participation has not equated to socioeconomic equality on a large scale for the Africana community. Utilizing Feagin's Systemic Racism Theory, this project looks to examine why solely relying upon the American political system is symptomatic of disagency for Africana people and argues that this dis-agency does not empower our people to seek solutions. It places the power to liberate in the oppressor's hands, thus maintaining the inequality that continues to exist in America. This article also argues for Africana people to look to themselves as the avenue for addressing the societal ills that it faces. It also argues that Africana people must be their own mechanism for liberation. In addition, the terms Africana and Black will be used interchangeably in the project because those terms are most readily identifiable to people of African descent living in America.\",\"published_in\":\"Ethnic Studies Review ; volume 36, issue 1, page 139-147 ; ISSN 1555-1881\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Simmons, Matthew\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/esr.2013.36.1.139\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a8d370f48317ac68b7687e6927e388cc040a12af636ee77c0f911de5d36473c7\",\"relevance\":99},{\"id\":\"d69d9d60b745a94509fb8da91a33d0c0f64311e54e676f447742e09d9a5bdc92\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au\\/index.php\\/SWPS\\/article\\/view\\/14287\\/12856; https:\\/\\/openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au\\/index.php\\/SWPS\\/article\\/view\\/14287\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au\\/index.php\\/SWPS\\/article\\/view\\/14287\",\"title\":\"Stepping into the Intersection: The Unintended Consequences of Presenting a \\u2018Latina Educational\\u2019 at a Feminist Health Organisation\",\"paper_abstract\":\"An intersectional approach is typically applied to individuals, but this lens is also needed at the level of systems. Similar to large institutions, human service agencies may maintain racism due to established patterns of Eurocentricity. Agencies also function as entities where change can be affected. The following case study is about the process of decentering whiteness at a feminist health organisation located in an urban centre in the United States. The author, a white, non-binary woman, serving on the board of directors, offered to present a graduate paper at an agency-wide meeting. Preparations for this presentation evolved into a year-long process, during which time the agency began to grapple with the limitations of a cultural competence framework in its services for women\\u2019s and trans health.Feminist intersectionality theory is used to examine the organisation\\u2019s steps towards facing its Eurocentricity. This case study provides examples from organisational practice, during a year of racial turbulence, to explore three strategies that human service agencies commonly use to avoid confronting internal issues of race. It deconstructs past events in which staff maintained systemic racism through (1) disowning past harm, (2) suppression of criticism, and (3) deflection of responsibility through white feminine fragility.A narrative of events is analysed with the support of scholarship to explore how an intersectional approach can address gaps in the flawed implementation of a cultural competence framework. Intersectionality theory can transform ways of thinking among human service providers to promote critical analysis of racism within agency settings. This framework also shows the connection between systemic racism and the delegitimisation of individuals, an essential concept to the task of decentering whiteness within human service organisations.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Work & Policy Studies: Social Justice, Practice and Theory; Vol 3, No 1 (2020): Beyond \\\"Cultural Competency\\\": Confronting Whiteness in Social Work ; 2209-0878\",\"year\":\"2020-05-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Miller, Berg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au\\/index.php\\/SWPS\\/article\\/view\\/14287\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d69d9d60b745a94509fb8da91a33d0c0f64311e54e676f447742e09d9a5bdc92\",\"relevance\":98},{\"id\":\"fa537b5d3c054d090ee91ce128ad2fca1c79772511a9701a645224b0c1e32118\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.lib.uoguelph.ca\\/index.php\\/perj\\/article\\/view\\/5348; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1911-9593; doi:10.21083\\/partnership.v15i1.5348; 1911-9593; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a2bcf82628c74bfe9c5e731e123470f7\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21083\\/partnership.v15i1.5348; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a2bcf82628c74bfe9c5e731e123470f7\",\"title\":\"Racialized youth in the public library: Systemic racism through a critical theory lens\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Public libraries are on the frontline of serving underprivileged groups like racialized youth and help them to mitigate social inequities that manifest in negative outcomes like education gaps, underemployment and access to safe and affordable housing. Although racialized youth account for half of the youth population in Canadian cities like Toronto, their experience in public libraries is an unstudied area of Canadian LIS scholarly and professional research. Existing research approaches youth as a homogenous group in terms of age and biological stages and does not account for race, class, and urbanism. However, racialized youth face different challenges in which race and systemic racism are a facet of everyday life. This work aims to reverse racial neutrality in public libraries by demonstrating how ambivalence about race perpetuates systemic inequalities and the disengagement of racialized youth. It draws on interdisciplinary research to show how the race-blind approach is not reflective of the needs of communities being served. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, it shows that public libraries can implement processes to gather race-specific data under the recently-implemented Anti-Racism Act (2017).

What is an apology supposed to achieve, and how do we know when it has achieved its purpose? These questions seem pretty straightforward when we are speaking of an apology as it is traditionally conceived, which considers an explicit action that I have performed toward another individual.

This essay will consider Emmanuel Levinas\\u2019s work and how it relates to this notion of a political apology. In some respects, Levinas\\u2019s thought is profoundly constructive and useful; however, his ahistorical, asymmetrical account of intersubjectivity is inadequate to explain what an apology seeks to achieve on a substantial political level.

An analysis of the production's choices and the critical responses it generated suggests that by consciously representing Jewish characters who struggle with their own religious and national identities through Palestinian performers, the play opens up the possibility of breaking the perception of balance between the occupier and the occupied.

Furthermore, we need to understand and reveal how whiteness has been socially constructed because the power of whiteness lies in its invisibility, and that fuels the perpetuation of systemic racism. In making whiteness visible, we can see how it has been wielded as a weapon, which in turn will allow us to see how destructive it is for everyone, whites included. As part of this work, we need to break down the disciplinary boundary between literary studies and critical race theory (a field within legal studies that examines systemic racism in the context of the law). One example of such an interdisciplinary intervention is to bring together Cheryl Harris, a critical race theorist, and Joyce Carol Oates, a novelist. Harris published one of the foundational pieces of critical race theory in 1993 with her law review article \\u201cWhiteness as Property,\\u201d a legal analysis of whiteness, and Oates produced a masterpiece of American literature in 1980 with her novel Bellefleur, a complex story of a powerful white family that spans seven generations. This pairing lays the groundwork for the type of interdisciplinary dialogue we need because, within literary studies, when the novelist is white and the characters are white, there is still very little emphasis on the study of whiteness even though race is a significant focus of attention when the novelist and characters are people of color. Whiteness is still invisible, and that is part of the problem I am describing, both within literary studies and in our society at large. We need an interdisciplinary intervention to pull back the curtain on whiteness, see how it operates, recognize its danger, and dismantle it. Bringing together Harris and Oates, specifically \\u201cWhiteness as Property\\u201d and Bellefleur, can help us do just that as we work towards achieving justice.\",\"published_in\":\"Bearing Witness: Joyce Carol Oates Studies, Vol 2 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Language and Literature; P; American literature; PS1-3576\",\"subject\":\"Language and Literature; P; American literature; \",\"authors\":\"Karen Gaffney\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15867\\/331917.2.3\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"0a5dc3de8d34a41dbb286b6808aad9a3e51b26ea2e64c256523430ab91e1d141\",\"relevance\":71},{\"id\":\"e6462ff25c9c05d5d6094e5365f7d40c61c6dbb6be052bd971c5d1cc5dd9ffc4\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.library.ubc.ca\\/index.php\\/cjur\\/article\\/view\\/190018\\/188796; https:\\/\\/ojs.library.ubc.ca\\/index.php\\/cjur\\/article\\/view\\/190018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.library.ubc.ca\\/index.php\\/cjur\\/article\\/view\\/190018\",\"title\":\"Criminalization of Minority Youth in the Youth Justice System in Canada\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Despite the immeasurable amount of research completed on adult correctional facilities within North America, little is known about the overrepresentation of visible minority youth within the juvenile justice system. Through preliminary indications from this experimentation high delinquency due to cultural identity and socio-economic status has caused the federal offender population to become diverse. The face of the youth justice system within Canada is rapidly changing. Increasing forms of diversity serves as a principal pattern because the criminalization of minority youth occurs from cultural incompetence, unawareness, and insensitivity. This study recovers the institutional\\/systemic forms of treatment that minority youth face within the criminal justice system. It also further shows that there is no focus on the experiences of minority youth within juvenile correctional facilities due to a lack of information. The examination of criminalized practices, policies and methods of police organizations, correctional institutions and the court of law within Canada reveals institutional racism. Racial antagonism within the youth justice system leads to the criminalization of minority youth, which serves as a foundation for why culture shapes the identity of racialized youth.

For many Indigenous children and families, mainstream Australian society fails to provide the conditions for social growth because it is built on systemic racism. In order to create the conditions for positive social engagement for Indigenous children and families, there needs to be a social investment framework which recognises that colonisation has impacted negatively on Indigenous social and economic capacity, and which builds on the strengths of Indigenous culture and respects the self-determining rights of Indigenous communities in order to re-build capacity.

This is justified by the requirement for universities to work towards monitoring and evaluating efforts to create non-discriminatory and inclusive training environments. Methods This study employed qualitative research methods. Ten Black African medical specialists were interviewed about their training experiences in two university training hospitals in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Interview data was collected using open-ended questions and coded and analysed using thematic and critical discursive analysis techniques. Results Four experiential themes emerged from the interview data, they included: 1) experiences of everyday racism during work hours, 2) the physical and psychological effects of tokenism and an increased need to perform, 3) institutional racism as a result of inconsistent and unclear methods of promotion and clinical competence building, and 4) an organisational culture that was experienced as having a race and gender bias. Conclusion This is a pilot study and there are limits on the generalizability of the data due to the small sample. What is clear from our participants, though, is the strong experiential component of finding it challenging to be a Black trainee in a White-dominated profession.

A long history of systemic racism has made these women extremely vulnerable to violent crimes. Most of their fates remain a mystery, but some murderers have been caught who are responsible for their deaths. I examined the news articles that cover the crimes of convicted murderers Robert Pickton and John Martin Crawford. Of the two, only Pickton is very well known. However, while the media covered his crimes extensively, much of the coverage is misleading. The aboriginality of the victims is downplayed, and other tactics are used to blame the victims and focus on the killer. The coverage surrounding John Martin Crawford uses similar misleading strategies, although there is significantly less of it. I argue that because the aboriginality of the victims was emphasized instead of downplayed in the coverage of Crawford\\u2019s murders, there was less interest in the cases. Most people will read about crimes when they can identify with the victims. While most of Pickton\\u2019s victims were aboriginal, the number of victims was so enormous and the details of the case were so grisly, that the aboriginality was downplayed to attract the attention that these other aspects gave the case. Crawford\\u2019s victims were all aboriginal women, but he killed fewer and was not seen as a threat. The media influences how people think about society.

The link between local racisms and global processes of disposses-sion and deprivation seems now more plausible than ever, even in the case of new racisms rising up in many Western countries. The contribution investiga-tes the following aspects: the Anthropocene as the unstable frame to understand the socio-ecological crisis; the new stage in the process of human and natural resources government called as \\u201cracialized soveregneity\\u201d; the decreasing of \\u201cnatural fertility of capital\\u201d and the different strategies to cope with it; geo-capitalism, global racial formation; \\u201csystemic\\u201d racism, worldwide apartheid prospects: how semi-peripheries are experiencing new or re-newed forms of local racial regimes; trajectories of racialization in the frame of Anthropocene: causes of Earth system alteration, migrations as adaptation strategies, and losses of habitat; the racialized body as the core of social manipulated reaction to global crisis; the \\u201cracialized unequal exchange\\u201d as grounded on historical division of people in different subordinate races.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Racism; racialization; anthropocene; unequal exchange\",\"subject\":\"Racism; racialization; anthropocene; unequal exchange\",\"authors\":\"Alietti, A.; Padovan, D.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11392\\/2413900\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f46f76c6c1ba208cd113c98583b1766e3eb6ee5ff30af1779a505a37f0bd8a9e\",\"relevance\":60},{\"id\":\"8d49c339c9cdfbc307b6b905d222f240f4fe507f2ebd8cf98b5981a8c27301ab\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.496; http:\\/\\/online.ucpress.edu\\/nrbp\\/article-pdf\\/1\\/4\\/496\\/439906\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.496.pdf\",\"title\":\"I Can\\u2019t Breathe\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Since 2014, public opinion data suggests that whites have become more supportive of the Black Lives Movement. The recent murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have prompted a national debate about the need to address systemic racism in policing within the United States. Recent studies have shown how racial resentment has spilled over into a wide range of political issues that are not associated with race; however, no current research examines how racial resentment might shape whites\\u2019 views toward Black Lives Matter. Employing the racial reaction theory and the 2016 American Election Study Survey, we hypothesize and confirm that whites with high levels of racial resentment, conservative ideology, and those who indicated support for Donald Trump hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement. Our results also show that Asians and Hispanics hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement, but that whites have the highest racial resentment levels. The results raise doubts about whether the recent shift in white public opinion is sustainable. Given that racial resentment is a predictor of support for Black Lives Matter, scholars and activists should approach white support for Black Lives Matter with caution because it is likely that increased racial resentment may lead to sustained white opposition to the movement.\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 4, page 496-515 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Riley, Emmitt Y.; Peterson, Clarissa\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.496\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8d49c339c9cdfbc307b6b905d222f240f4fe507f2ebd8cf98b5981a8c27301ab\",\"relevance\":59},{\"id\":\"3165d60a7090ae3dc11e8f0a56882e5d72fc8679d1e9bc56b42edc386fc46f26\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unisalento.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18562; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2421-2113; 2421-2113; doi:10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p55; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e9e161dce28847c3829f8a82393f9be3\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p55; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e9e161dce28847c3829f8a82393f9be3\",\"title\":\"\\u201cI believe in that movement and I believe in that chant\\u201d: The influence of Black Lives Matter on resilience and empowerment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Over the past few years, systemic racism has been increasingly in the news via the work of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 55-72 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Racism; Empowerment; Resilience; Black Lives Matter; Philosophy.

This article is based on a research project conducted in Toronto, Ontario that implemented Aboriginal research methodologies to explore ways to increase collaboration between Aboriginal families, treatment counsellors, and child welfare workers.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement. It also explores the implications of education, engagement, and activism for people of color and libraries today. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The authors have engaged the topic from a critical race perspective as a practice in exercising voice \\u2013 telling stories, presenting counterstories, and practicing advocacy (Ladson-Billings, 1998). Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields. This paper has implications for developing understanding of questions about equitable service provision.\",\"published_in\":\"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal, 36(8)\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"black lives matter; library; social justice; community; inclusion; libraries; communities; neutrality; diversity; equity\",\"subject\":\"black lives matter; library; social justice; community; inclusion; libraries; communities; neutrality; diversity; equity\",\"authors\":\"index:\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17615\\/pyyv-r646\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e644bc514b8c2bb5339de461ada6ebe7c30d125c633eeae192c4e71f8b3d7fe4\",\"relevance\":47},{\"id\":\"63c0e726ee49933cfc6fa6625e67d67ac5ab98376f7c408a190508339a991553\",\"relation\":\"Discourse & Society--0957-9265--1460-3624 Vol. 24 Issue. 1 No. pp: 89-109\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/handle.uws.edu.au:8081\\/1959.7\\/524326; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0957926512463635\",\"title\":\"Denial of racism and its implications for local action\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Literature on modern racism identifies denial as one of its key features. This article examines the discourses of denial that feature in the talk of local anti-racism actors in Australia, and asks what drives these discourses. The research draws on qualitative interviews undertaken with participants involved in local anti-racism in two case study areas, one in South Australia and the other in New South Wales. This article explores the way local participants in the case study areas deployed four discourses to deny or minimise racism: temporal deflections; spatial deflections; deflections from the mainstream; and absence discourses. Place defending and the desire to protect one's local area from being branded a racist space is discussed as a driver of those local denial discourses. Local denial of racism is also linked to national politics of racism and anti-racism. In particular, the Australian government's retreat from multiculturalism, and the preference for 'harmony' rather than 'anti-racism' initiatives, was linked to the avoidance of the language of racism within participants' responses. The way denial discourses narrow the range of possibilities for local anti-racism is discussed, as is the importance of acknowledgement of racism, particularly institutional and systemic racism. Public acknowledgement of these forms of racism will broaden the scope of local anti-racism.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"XXXXXX - Unknown; anti-racism; Aboriginal Australians; Australia; denial; racism; discrimination; multiculturalism; reconciliation\",\"subject\":\"XXXXXX - Unknown; anti-racism; Aboriginal Australians; Australia; denial; racism; discrimination; multiculturalism; reconciliation\",\"authors\":\"Nelson, Jacqueline (R17218)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/handle.uws.edu.au:8081\\/1959.7\\/524326\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"63c0e726ee49933cfc6fa6625e67d67ac5ab98376f7c408a190508339a991553\",\"relevance\":46},{\"id\":\"3628a175d69110ba2eff807b50a84c1227a21edcef81915ce3577f6c3635317b\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18562; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p55\",\"title\":\"\\u201cI believe in that movement and I believe in that chant\\u201d: The influence of Black Lives Matter on resilience and empowerment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Over the past few years, systemic racism has been increasingly in the news via the work of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 55-72 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Using transnational anti-Black racism in Latin America as a point of departure, we advance a theorization of critical race theory in education capable of interrogating racist structures of coloniality, modernity, and White supremacy that operate globally to suppress Black humanity and humanness in general. To that extent, we draw from and reposition critical race theory (CRT) from its sociohistoric heritage in the United States and instead conceptualize transnational anti-Black racism vis-\\u00e0-vis a Black Diaspora reading of CRT.

This is not an isolated phenomenon. Indigenous students in Canada and Romani children in Europe are also disproportionately represented in special schooling. This paper asks whether systemic racism, which fails to perceive cultural differences between the ethos of Australian educational systems and the experiences and abilities of Indigenous students, is the catalyst for placing many Indigenous students in special schooling, away from the mainstream. The paper applies an analysis based on anti-discrimination law to argue that while allocation on the basis of intellectual disability or behaviour disorders may not be deliberate racism, the criteria developed for the allocation may be measuring conformity to the dominant culture. If the policies underlying this segregation are unreasonable in the circumstances, they could constitute indirect racial discrimination against Indigenous students.

Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism.

Owing to its roots in the environmental justice movement, addressing systemic racism is central to climate justice praxis in the United States, which is a necessary intervention in typically technocratic climate politics. What emerges from US climate justice is a moral appeal to \\u2018relationship\\u2019 as politics, the procedural demand that communities of color (the \\u2018frontline\\u2019) lead the movement, and a distributive claim on carbon pricing revenue. However, this praxis precludes a critique of racial capitalism, the process that relies on structural racism to enhance accumulation, alienating, exploiting, and immiserating black, brown, and white, while carrying out ecocide. The lack of an analysis of how class and race produce the crises climate justice confronts prevents the movement from demanding that global north fossil fuel abolition occur in tandem with the reassertion of the public over the private and de-growth. Drawing on research conducted primarily in Oregon and Washington, I argue that race works to both create and limit the transformative possibilities of climate politics.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Sciences, Vol 7, Iss 10, p 192 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"climate justice movement; carbon pricing; racial capitalism; de-growth; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"climate justice movement; carbon pricing; racial capitalism; de-growth; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Rachel Slocum\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/socsci7100192\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"3106dddcb4c5404f49406bef81c9de4739718a27531f23eb981f22f2ec1723fb\",\"relevance\":36},{\"id\":\"6dbb28f340609bed04c0437db44df0d973cff3831f1cb7a7896f50d5689b3e19\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journalhosting.ucalgary.ca\\/index.php\\/cjnse\\/article\\/view\\/53057\\/53701; https:\\/\\/journalhosting.ucalgary.ca\\/index.php\\/cjnse\\/article\\/view\\/53057\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/journalhosting.ucalgary.ca\\/index.php\\/cjnse\\/article\\/view\\/53057\",\"title\":\"A #selfie meritocracy in educator professional development: Generating complacency through self-reflection\",\"paper_abstract\":\"At the cornerstone of professional development for K-12 teachers, there is an emphasis on practices of self-reflection and reflective practice that turn the professional educator gaze inward towards the self. Self-reflection has emerged through the teacher-as-researcher and the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner identities in professional development.

Consequently, reconciliation remains an elusive concept. Here we outline 10 Calls to Action to natural scientists to enable reconciliation in their work. We focus on natural scientists because a common connection to the land should tie the social license of natural scientists more closely to Indigenous communities than currently exists. We also focus on natural sciences because of the underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in this field. We draw on existing guidelines and our experiences in northern Canada. Our 10 Calls to Action are triggered by frustration. The authors have witnessed examples where natural scientists treat Indigenous communities with blatant disrespect or with ignorance of Indigenous rights.

Through a multiplatform discourse analysis of the Leslie Jones hack, this paper examines the connections between platform vulnerabilities and the vulnerabilities of women, as well as the links between the rise of the alt-right and the mainstreaming of racist, misogynistic trolling behaviors. Building on Whitney Phillips\\u2019s (2015) arguments about the connections between trolling and mainstream culture, this case study maps a moment when these subcultural behaviors were becoming more dominant and provides a microcosm through which to understand the interconnectedness between digital platforms, politics and Politics, race, and gender.

Overall, the discourse around Leslie Jones\\u2019s hack evinces the mainstreaming of both policy discourse around online harassment and the supposedly subcultural trolling culture that frequently aligns with the alt-right. While other instances of online harassment have garnered significant media attention, the hatred toward Jones surfaced at a cultural and political tipping point, speaking to larger political divides within the United States.\",\"published_in\":\"AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research; 2017: AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research ; 2162-3317\",\"year\":\"2019-11-05\",\"subject_orig\":\"celebrity; critical discourse analysis; race; gender; sexuality\",\"subject\":\"celebrity; critical discourse analysis; race; gender; sexuality\",\"authors\":\"Lawson, Caitlin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.uic.edu\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/spir\\/article\\/view\\/10076\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d8f17b51c49431ab8e0e6f119efc25fa520991e6e5efb2c971de8e6add5c27b7\",\"relevance\":27},{\"id\":\"dafd171b76d3b5d172693066f2fe12ec32e24895a4ba31e722555f5fbf01c154\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.13016\\/9oq8-xmx4; Paradies, Yin (2006) A systematic review of empirical research on self-reported racism and health.

These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism.

This multidimensional identity complicated black women\\u2019s involvement in the second wave feminist movement, leading to a so-called \\u201cconspiracy of silence.\\u201d Primary sources, including feminist publications, interviews, and autobiographies reveal that black women were largely absent from the mainstream pro-choice feminist discourse and mobilizations in the 1970s. Their silence and lack of involvement, however, was not because access to abortion was unimportant nor irrelevant to them. Rather, my research suggests that their silence was rooted in complex historical and ideological barriers as well as a failure of the mainstream feminist movement to consider their unique history, needs, and circumstances. This research project draws attention to the historical silences by reading \\u201cagainst the grain\\u201d with the aim to shed light on the complicated politics within the second-wave feminist movement and provide a framework for understanding why black women\\u2019s voices were silenced in this sphere.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Abortion; Reproductive justice; Hyde Amendment; Intersectionality; Racial inequality; Women of color; Black feminism; Systemic racism; Socioeconomic inequality; Women's health; Reproductive rights; Black women; White privilege; Pro-choice feminist movement; Health policy\",\"subject\":\"Abortion; Reproductive justice; Hyde Amendment; Intersectionality; Racial inequality; Women of color; Black feminism; Systemic racism; Socioeconomic inequality; Women's health; Reproductive rights; Black women; White privilege; Pro-choice feminist movement; Health policy\",\"authors\":\"Wilms-Crowe, Momo\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1794\\/23513\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"20d5aa0a1ff948afd0fa60d9cbb51ff43c6b5182fd44c8a52a8cc1d022e257d3\",\"relevance\":25},{\"id\":\"86f7e828be88352847018061bae70cb293ac3ee7d2feb260bd6b7c0b94a4ed47\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.socscimed.2011.06.058; Ziersch, A and Gallaher, G and Baum, F and Bentley, M, Responding to racism: Insights on how racism can damage health from an urban study of Australian Aboriginal people, Social Science & Medicine, 73, (7) pp. 1045-1053.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 2006\\/07 with 153 Aboriginal people living in Adelaide, Australia. Participants were asked about their experience of, and responses to, racism, and the impact of these experiences on their health. Racism was regularly experienced by 93% of participants. Almost two thirds of people felt that racism affected their health. Using a thematic analysis with a particular focus on how agency and structure interacted, a number of key reactions and responses to racism were identified. These included: emotional and physiological reactions; and responses such as gaining support from social networks; confronting the person\\/situation; ignoring it; avoiding situations where they might experience racism; 'minimising' the significance or severity of racism or questioning whether incidents were racist; and consuming alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. A further theme was a conscious decision to not 'allow' racism to affect health. Our study found that most people used more than one of these coping strategies, and that strategies were selected with an awareness of positive and negative health impacts. While individuals demonstrated substantial agency in their responses, there were clear structural constraints on how they reacted and responded. We found that not only was racism potentially detrimental to health, but so too were some responses. However, while some strategies appeared 'healthier' than others, most strategies entailed costs and benefits, and these depended on the meanings of responses for individuals. This paper concludes that initiatives to promote health-protective responses to racism need to consider structural constraints and the overarching goal of reducing systemic racism.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2011\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medical and Health Sciences; Public Health and Health Services; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health\",\"subject\":\"Medical and Health Sciences; Public Health and Health Services; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health\",\"authors\":\"Ziersch, A; Gallaher, G; Baum, F; Bentley, M\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.socscimed.2011.06.058\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"86f7e828be88352847018061bae70cb293ac3ee7d2feb260bd6b7c0b94a4ed47\",\"relevance\":24},{\"id\":\"45b38db8398baea8bb55ad34c18d28fe9bbc0f4528e612dcebf60b066da2e7b3\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/jpepsy\\/jsaa066; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/jpepsy\\/article-pdf\\/45\\/8\\/833\\/33662916\\/jsaa066.pdf\",\"title\":\"Introduction to the Special Issue: Addressing Health Disparities in Pediatric Psychology\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract This introduction to the special issue on Addressing Health Disparities in Pediatric Psychology provides context for why this special issue is needed, reviews key findings of the accepted articles, and discusses future directions for advancing the field. This special issue, one of three on this topic area that has been put forth in the history of this journal, comes at a critical point in our world. This is a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is systematically infecting Black, Indigenous, and People of Color and when there has been increased attention to systemic racism and intersecting violence inherent in multiple systems, including the justice, health, and educational systems. Using Kilbourne et al. (2016) framework, this special issue focuses on Phase 2 and Phase 3 research. Rather than only identifying health disparities (Phase 1), this issue focuses on understanding mechanisms and translating such understanding into interventions and policy changes. The accepted articles span a wide gamut from obesity to autism to rural populations. Furthermore, the articles provide methods for advancing the field beyond simply noting that systematic differences exist toward strategies to address these inequities. We conclude this introduction by discussing next steps for future research, with hopes that it inspires the next generation to study issues of disparities and inequity in deeper, more meaningful, and impactful ways.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Pediatric Psychology ; volume 45, issue 8, page 833-838 ; ISSN 0146-8693 1465-735X\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Pediatrics, Perinatology, and Child Health; Developmental and Educational Psychology\",\"subject\":\"Pediatrics, Perinatology, and Child Health; Developmental and Educational Psychology\",\"authors\":\"Valrie, Cecelia; Thurston, Idia; Santos,, Melissa\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/jpepsy\\/jsaa066\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"45b38db8398baea8bb55ad34c18d28fe9bbc0f4528e612dcebf60b066da2e7b3\",\"relevance\":23},{\"id\":\"8b241e97f3fac2669b27390852bdc14becfa47d9c3af7fe841c624ec9c103e89\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/geronb\\/gbz141; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/psychsocgerontology\\/advance-article-pdf\\/doi\\/10.1093\\/geronb\\/gbz141\\/30334827\\/gbz141.pdf; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/psychsocgerontology\\/article-pdf\\/75\\/9\\/1972\\/33904841\\/gbz141.pdf\",\"title\":\"Black\\u2013White Disparities in Moves to Assisted Living and Nursing Homes Among Older Medicare Beneficiaries\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Objectives Investigate black-white disparities in older adults\\u2019 moves to assisted living and nursing homes and draw from the Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model to test explanations for any disparities.

Results: Results showed that students were less likely to perceive a neurotransmitter imbalance to cause mental illness, as opposed to what was emphasized during a formal medical education. Students and residents also understood the importance of factors such as systemic racism and socioeconomic status in the development of mental illness, which were factors that did not receive heavy emphasis during medical education. Furthermore, students and residents believed that not only did mental illnesses have nonuniform pathologies, but that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders also had the propensity to sometimes arbitrarily categorize individuals with potentially negative consequences.

It has raised awareness about systemic racism and sexism as well as social and economic conditions experienced by Canada's Indigenous population. Yet, research shows that Indigenous males are the most likely to be murdered in Canada (Mulligan, Axford, & Soecki, 2016). Since Indigenous men are going missing and are murdered in disturbing numbers, and they are fathers, brothers, and sons to Indigenous women and girls, it is understandable that many in the Indigenous community wanted to include them in the inquiry.

Though some critique disparities through a structural lens, others use deficit discourse, blaming families of color and working-class families for educational outcomes. This study examines how state policy insiders explain educational inequity, shedding light on the complex relationship between language and the maintenance of systemic racism and classism in education. Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity. These strategies allowed some policy insiders to strengthen deficit discourse, divert attention from structural issues, and characterize themselves positively while advancing racist and classist ideas. These findings have compelling implications in terms of possibilities for policy changes supportive of educational equity.\",\"published_in\":\"education policy analysis archives; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; archivos analiticos de politicas educativas; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; Arquivos Anal\\u00edticos de Pol\\u00edticas Educativas; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; 1068-2341\",\"year\":\"2015-09-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class\",\"subject\":\"policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class\",\"authors\":\"Bertrand, Melanie; Perez, Wendy Y.; Rogers, John\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/epaa.asu.edu\\/ojs\\/article\\/view\\/2068\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"ee5a08d288a1fe131284b29707da56c29cbdcc1e1410e67e592de40ad2072b54\",\"relevance\":18},{\"id\":\"ceb5f2147b4ab177218ab7d08b9c76a7b745adfa13c3930c65fad7dcf126d60f\",\"relation\":\"qt4db86871; https:\\/\\/escholarship.org\\/uc\\/item\\/4db86871\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/escholarship.org\\/uc\\/item\\/4db86871\",\"title\":\"Racial residential segregation, socioeconomic disparities, and the White-Black survival gap.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"To evaluate the association between racial residential segregation, a prominent manifestation of systemic racism, and the White-Black survival gap in a contemporary cohort of adults, and to assess the extent to which socioeconomic inequality explains this association.This was a cross sectional study of White and Black men and women aged 35-75 living in 102 large US Core Based Statistical Areas. The main outcome was the White-Black survival gap. We used 2009-2013 CDC mortality data for Black and White men and women to calculate age-, sex- and race adjusted White and Black mortality rates. We measured segregation using the Dissimilarity index, obtained from the Manhattan Institute. We used the 2009-2013 American Community Survey to define indicators of socioeconomic inequality. We estimated the CBSA-level White-Black gap in probability of survival using sequential linear regression models accounting for the CBSA dissimilarity index and race-specific socioeconomic indicators.Black men and women had a 14% and 9% lower probability of survival from age 35 to 75 than their white counterparts. Residential segregation was strongly associated with the survival gap, and this relationship was partly, but not fully, explained by socioeconomic inequality. At the lowest observed level of segregation, and with the Black socioeconomic status (SES) assumed to be at the White SES level scenario, the survival gap is essentially eliminated.White-Black differences in survival remain wide notwithstanding public health efforts to improve life expectancy and initiatives to reduce health disparities.

The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies.

In Australia, enduring barriers to good health and good healthcare remain, in spite of long-standing policy priorities. These barriers include the ongoing reality of colonisation, and silence about its implications. People working in and using the health system need to relate across cultures, but they approach this endeavour with a complex mixture of goodwill, defensiveness, guilt and anxiety. Methods: We analysed what is known in Australia about differentials in access to good care, and the underlying factors that entrench them, as well as strategies for developing mainstream competence in care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and communities. Analysis and Conclusions: The available evidence of differentials in access and quality that are not explained by clinical or demographic variables is unequivocal. Official policy needs to be implemented at the system and organisation level through operational policies, programs and protocols, and through relationships with Aboriginal healthcare providers and community organisations.

In response, tools to oppose systemic racism and minimize harm in the classroom as well as recommendations for change and resistance are addressed. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The paper focuses on historical analysis of libraries as institutions within larger educational systems and draws heavily on critical theories as a method of critique. Findings This paper demonstrates that the 45th presidential administration is a logical progression of neoliberalism and institutionalized discrimination, which has had adverse effects on the health and safety of (primarily marginalized) students, library workers and library practice, but that critical reflection and information seeking on part of librarians may provide solutions. Practical implications This paper can be used as a guide for librarians seeking to contextualize the educational environment and apply a critical praxis to information literacy programs. Social implications The reflection presented in this paper can aid in expanding awareness in LIS surrounding issues of equity and justice, and impart urgency and need for institutional change.

We do not attempt to re-analyse this but do note that standard pandemic planning often disadvantages the weak and vulnerable in terms of allocation of resources to those with a greater chance of functional survival. We more argue from a debt that society owes its children in terms of the sacrifices they have made in terms of school, social life, healthcare and overall welfare during the pandemic from which they were at markedly less risk than adults.

However, the conceptualization of healthy aging and how age-related issues are addressed in community-based structures, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities, remain poorly understood, especially from the Stakeholder perspective. Stakeholders, such as faith leaders and members of community-based organizations, engage in regular negotiations to advance health equity in their communities by partnering and collaborating with older adults and their families as well as other local and federal organizations. The Stakeholder Engagement in Aging Research and Community Health (SEARCH) Study employs multiple research methods to illuminate Stakeholders\\u2019 perspectives on barriers and facilitators to healthy aging in diverse communities. This presentation highlights findings from in-depth, qualitative interviews with Stakeholders (N=37) serving African American, Latinx, and South Asian older adults. Emergent themes suggest that systemic racism, stigmatization, limited health literacy, and cultural beliefs serve as barriers to healthy aging across groups. Within groups, Stakeholders report precarious immigration status and fragile and fragmented life situations as barriers among Latinx older adults, while acculturative stress presents a challenge to healthy aging in South Asian older adults. Food insecurity and neighborhood factors such as exposure to violence and socio-economic disadvantages act as barriers among African American older adults. Conversely, religious faith and spirituality, familial support, and culturally-congruent care serve as facilitators across groups. The findings from this study underscore the continued need for intersectional, inclusive, and culturally-informed approaches to supporting healthy aging within diverse communities.\",\"published_in\":\"Innovation in Aging ; volume 3, issue Supplement_1, page S961-S961 ; ISSN 2399-5300\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Khan, Mushira; Graham, Karen; Washington, Tarisha; Kim, Abigail; Shah, Raj C; Glover, Crystal M\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/geroni\\/igz038.3484\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"1e82eca688b1b757c5e3c7a4c360f15226169bc6ef8305067aa396db4f996229\",\"relevance\":10},{\"id\":\"a9045af65db7d148e9d728387df94f5c6c9f81ea18337a855a11381609b3d97a\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/jamia\\/ocaa217; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/jamia\\/advance-article-pdf\\/doi\\/10.1093\\/jamia\\/ocaa217\\/33701765\\/ocaa217.pdf; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/jamia\\/advance-article-pdf\\/doi\\/10.1093\\/jamia\\/ocaa217\\/34053807\\/ocaa217.pdf\",\"title\":\"Telemedicine and healthcare disparities: a cohort study in a large healthcare system in New York City during COVID-19\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Objective Through the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telemedicine became a necessary entry point into the process of diagnosis, triage, and treatment. Racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare have been well documented in COVID-19 with respect to risk of infection and in-hospital outcomes once admitted, and here we assess disparities in those who access healthcare via telemedicine for COVID-19. Materials and Methods Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis, and COVID test results. Results Controlling for individual and community-level attributes, Black patients had 0.6 times the adjusted odds (95% CI: 0.58\\u20130.63) of accessing care through telemedicine compared to white patients, though they are increasingly accessing telemedicine for urgent care, driven by a younger and female population. COVID diagnoses were significantly more likely for Black versus white telemedicine patients. Discussion There are disparities for Black patients accessing telemedicine, however increased uptake by young, female Black patients. Mean income and decreased mean household size of a zip code were also significantly related to telemedicine use. Conclusion Telemedicine access disparities reflect those in in-person healthcare access. Roots of disparate use are complex and reflect individual, community, and structural factors, including their intersection\\u2014many of which are due to systemic racism. Evidence regarding disparities that manifest through telemedicine can be used to inform tool design and systemic efforts to promote digital health equity.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association ; ISSN 1067-5027 1527-974X\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Health Informatics\",\"subject\":\"Health Informatics\",\"authors\":\"Chunara, Rumi; Zhao, Yuan; Chen, Ji; Lawrence, Katharine; Testa, Paul A; Nov, Oded; Mann, Devin M\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/jamia\\/ocaa217\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a9045af65db7d148e9d728387df94f5c6c9f81ea18337a855a11381609b3d97a\",\"relevance\":9},{\"id\":\"16e6dee58503a7ddcf10d543816013dd9a0d16c048d67f04f01abc2a907f37a8\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/epaa.asu.edu\\/ojs\\/article\\/view\\/2068; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1068-2341; 1068-2341; doi:10.14507\\/epaa.v23.2068; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7e68340f1fa84c76b0e882c0e8d027bc\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14507\\/epaa.v23.2068; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7e68340f1fa84c76b0e882c0e8d027bc\",\"title\":\"The covert mechanisms of education policy discourse: Unmasking policy insiders\\u2019 discourses and discursive strategies in upholding or challenging racism and classism in education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Policy insiders across party lines increasingly acknowledge educational \\u201cgaps,\\u201d yet they talk about this inequity in very different ways. Though some critique disparities through a structural lens, others use deficit discourse, blaming families of color and working-class families for educational outcomes. This study examines how state policy insiders explain educational inequity, shedding light on the complex relationship between language and the maintenance of systemic racism and classism in education. Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity. These strategies allowed some policy insiders to strengthen deficit discourse, divert attention from structural issues, and characterize themselves positively while advancing racist and classist ideas. These findings have compelling implications in terms of possibilities for policy changes supportive of educational equity.\",\"published_in\":\"Education Policy Analysis Archives, Vol 23, Iss 0 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"Melanie Bertrand; Wendy Y.

In Australia, enduring barriers to good health and good healthcare remain, in spite of long-standing policy priorities. These barriers include the ongoing reality of colonisation, and silence about its implications. People working in and using the health system need to relate across cultures, but they approach this endeavour witha complex mixture of goodwill, defensiveness, guilt and anxiety. Methods: We analysed what is known in Australia about differentials in access to good care, and the underlying factors that entrench them, as well as strategies for developing mainstream competence in care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and communities. Analysis and Conclusions: The available evidence of differentials in access and quality that are not explained by clinical or demographic variables is unequivocal.Official policy needs to be implemented at the system and organisation level through operational policies, programs and protocols, and through relationships with Aboriginal healthcare providers and community organisations.

The dominant discourses around these issues focus on and often seek to silence racism or diminish its occurrence in the society, in other words: deflections and denial of racism dominate. Such denials and deflections belie the lived experiences of racism among racial(ised) minorities. Perhaps not surprisingly therefore, within such a context, there is a paucity of research on how community development practice engages with issues of race, racialisation, racism and racial inequalities. Little is known about how community development practitioners work with\\/in racially diverse communities or the extent to which Australian community development practice employs a \\u2018race lense\\u2019 in its practice. The discussions in this paper therefore emanate from an understanding that \\u2018colour (race)-blind\\u2019 practice still dominates community development work in Australia. The main contention is that unexamined colour-blind practice has the potential to reproduce systemic racism or systems of racial inequalities. The question informing this paper therefore, is: what is the significance of race in community development practice in Australia? To address this question, the paper centres \\u201cthe experienced reality of lived racism\\u201d (Essed, 1991, p. vii) by black African migrants in Australia - which highlight the pervasiveness of racism in their everyday lives - to argue the need for conversations and considerations about race and inclusion within the field of community development. In the end, the discussions in this paper will raise important questions about the significance of race in community development practice in Australia and the consequences of race-blind practice and colour-mutism when working with\\/in ethnic and racially diverse communities. Perhaps more importantly, the paper contributes to \\u2018courageous conversations\\u2019 about how community development practitioners can work effectively across ethnic and racial boundaries without (re)producing systemic structures of racial inequalities.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Work and Policy Studies: Social Justice, Practice and Theory; Vol 2, No 1 (2019): Current issues in community work: debates and dilemmas ; 2209-0878\",\"year\":\"2019-03-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Mapedzahama, Virginia\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au\\/index.php\\/SWPS\\/article\\/view\\/13232\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"ca4b7dbf56329208051e6761378980d21ea1d317105cf4828cade3bf4da79c51\",\"relevance\":4},{\"id\":\"f88ba7d517f2904c9fe367eb1100e8aefc4edc1644f3b4fda8373f2e1aa961b0\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/mje.mcgill.ca\\/article\\/view\\/9519\\/7376; http:\\/\\/mje.mcgill.ca\\/article\\/view\\/9519\\/7377; http:\\/\\/mje.mcgill.ca\\/article\\/downloadSuppFile\\/9519\\/448\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/mje.mcgill.ca\\/article\\/view\\/9519\",\"title\":\"UNLEARNING COLONIAL IDENTITIES WHILE ENGAGING IN RELATIONALITY: SETTLER TEACHERS\\u2019 EDUCATION-AS-RECONCILIATION\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Before the TRC\\u2019s Calls to Action, we were a collaborative teacher-education partnership of Anishinaabekwe and White settler researching and teaching reconciliation as pedagogical practice with five cohorts of settler teacher-candidates.

Indigenous peoples continue to be oppressed by racial discrimination enacted through legislation, policies and practices of the Canadian state, including the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). Systemic racism, practiced through institutionalized policies and customary behaviour affecting people working in organizations, results in inequality for some groups and privileges for others. Since 2002 the CAF has been covered by the federal Employment Equity Act whose purpose is to address systemic discrimination by requiring employers to remove and prevent systemic barriers to equality for Indigenous people, women and \\u201cvisible minorities\\u201d and to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the Canadian population. Aside from its legal obligation, it is in the interest of the CAF to recruit and retain Indigenous People because they are an essential part of Canada\\u2019s labour supply. However Indigenous members of the CAF comprise a small and marginalized minority within a rigid, bureaucratic and culturally foreign organization.Implementing the Employment Equity Act could assist the CAF to address the Canadian state\\u2019s promise of reconciliation, fairness and equality for Indigenous people. This chapter reviews available evidence bearing on the CAF\\u2019s employment equity record, which presents a pattern of resistance to the Act\\u2019s requirements and failure to progress toward a representative workforce. In the absence of effective action to implement change, the CAF has yet to find a path from systemic racism toward employment equity for Indigenous People.

The ideal model for an unbiased homeless system would distribute assistance such that it is received in equal percentages across racial\\/ethnic groups as the percent of that racial group experiencing homelessness. One of the consequences of systemic racism is an overrepresentation of people of color among those who experience homelessness. Black people make up 11% of the general population of Western New York but they account for 25% of the people in poverty and 47% of the homeless population. When the number of people who experience homelessness are compared against the number of people who are in poverty, Black people living in poverty are 3 times more likely to experience homelessness compared to White people.

This special report aims to summarize selected interventions to reduce racial\\/ethnic disparities in stroke prevention and treatment. It reviews the social determinants of health and the determinants of racial\\/ethnic disparities in care. It provides a focused summary of selected interventions aimed at reducing stroke risk factors, increasing awareness of stroke symptoms, and improving access to care for stroke because these interventions hold the promise of reducing racial\\/ethnic disparities in stroke death rates. It also discusses knowledge gaps and future directions.

These statistics represent a clear disparity between whites and African Americans in the criminal justice system and give valid reason to be concerned about the effects of mass incarceration and the war on drugs on African American communities (Bobo and Johnson 2004). This paper will draw from conflict theory to argue that the methods employed to fight the war on drugs in America (whether purposefully or not) work to deplete social welfare of African American communities through the use of discriminatory rhetoric, increasingly harsh and racially targeted policies, and prejudicial enforcement and mobilization of these policies, which reinforce existing systems of control and domination in North American society. Possible strategies that may be implemented to remediate this issue include shifting focus from supply reduction strategies (which mainly function to punish offenders) to demand reduction strategies which aim to persuade people not to use or buy drugs, through education and drug abuse treatment (Tonry 1994:66), including integrated public health-public safety strategies (Marlowe 2003). war on drugs; racism; systemic racism; justice system; criminal justice system; mass incarceration; drug crime; drug crimes; policing; criminology The Sociological Imagination: Undergraduate Journal; Vol 6 No 1 (2020) Boghosian, Mileva\"},{\"id\":\"ee935a2b031f184887f4a9d2d6b0dce088915b7870830a5f5cff31a69d847f10\",\"content\":\"Id\\u00e9ologie raciste et fiction t\\u00e9l\\u00e9visuelle Partant du postulat qu\\u2019il existe un racisme syst\\u00e9mique auquel contribuent les m\\u00e9dias, l\\u2019auteure explore les modalit\\u00e9s de mat\\u00e9rialisation de l\\u2019id\\u00e9ologie raciste dans la fiction s\\u00e9rielle espagnole.

Africana people have made strides at all levels of the American government. Africana people were a vital voting block that helped to elect the first American President of African descent. However, studies have shown that the conditions of Africana people in America have not substantially changed since the Voting Rights Act of 1 965 was enacted. Africana political participation has not equated to socioeconomic equality on a large scale for the Africana community. Utilizing Feagin's Systemic Racism Theory, this project looks to examine why solely relying upon the American political system is symptomatic of disagency for Africana people and argues that this dis-agency does not empower our people to seek solutions. It places the power to liberate in the oppressor's hands, thus maintaining the inequality that continues to exist in America. This article also argues for Africana people to look to themselves as the avenue for addressing the societal ills that it faces. It also argues that Africana people must be their own mechanism for liberation. In addition, the terms Africana and Black will be used interchangeably in the project because those terms are most readily identifiable to people of African descent living in America.

Similar to large institutions, human service agencies may maintain racism due to established patterns of Eurocentricity. Agencies also function as entities where change can be affected. The following case study is about the process of decentering whiteness at a feminist health organisation located in an urban centre in the United States. The author, a white, non-binary woman, serving on the board of directors, offered to present a graduate paper at an agency-wide meeting. Preparations for this presentation evolved into a year-long process, during which time the agency began to grapple with the limitations of a cultural competence framework in its services for women\\u2019s and trans health.Feminist intersectionality theory is used to examine the organisation\\u2019s steps towards facing its Eurocentricity. This case study provides examples from organisational practice, during a year of racial turbulence, to explore three strategies that human service agencies commonly use to avoid confronting internal issues of race. It deconstructs past events in which staff maintained systemic racism through (1) disowning past harm, (2) suppression of criticism, and (3) deflection of responsibility through white feminine fragility.A narrative of events is analysed with the support of scholarship to explore how an intersectional approach can address gaps in the flawed implementation of a cultural competence framework. Intersectionality theory can transform ways of thinking among human service providers to promote critical analysis of racism within agency settings. This framework also shows the connection between systemic racism and the delegitimisation of individuals, an essential concept to the task of decentering whiteness within human service organisations.

Although racialized youth account for half of the youth population in Canadian cities like Toronto, their experience in public libraries is an unstudied area of Canadian LIS scholarly and professional research. Existing research approaches youth as a homogenous group in terms of age and biological stages and does not account for race, class, and urbanism. However, racialized youth face different challenges in which race and systemic racism are a facet of everyday life. This work aims to reverse racial neutrality in public libraries by demonstrating how ambivalence about race perpetuates systemic inequalities and the disengagement of racialized youth. It draws on interdisciplinary research to show how the race-blind approach is not reflective of the needs of communities being served. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, it shows that public libraries can implement processes to gather race-specific data under the recently-implemented Anti-Racism Act (2017). This will provide a contextual understanding of the racial make-up of users and provide a valuable frame of reference to support efforts to build stronger and more effective relationships.

What is an apology supposed to achieve, and how do we know when it has achieved its purpose? These questions seem pretty straightforward when we are speaking of an apology as it is traditionally conceived, which considers an explicit action that I have performed toward another individual. But how does one apologize for one\\u2019s thrownness into systemic structures of inequality and violence\\u2014such as America\\u2019s long history of racism toward people of color?

This essay will consider Emmanuel Levinas\\u2019s work and how it relates to this notion of a political apology. In some respects, Levinas\\u2019s thought is profoundly constructive and useful; however, his ahistorical, asymmetrical account of intersubjectivity is inadequate to explain what an apology seeks to achieve on a substantial political level. For this, I believe we must articulate a Levinasian-inspired account of the self\\u207bother relation that more adequately takes into account both parties as well as the concrete situation in which the need for apology arises.

Our purpose was to explore the booktalking experience as a means of developing preservice librarians' understanding of culturally relevant pedagogy, a stance concerned with developing cultural competence and critical consciousness. Our findings revealed that preservice librarians gained different levels of understanding of culturally relevant pedagogy yet, the experience provided them with an opportunity for engaging in critical reflection regarding personal bias and systemic racism in schools and literature.

One midsize institution learned through an assessment of its campus climate that its institutional practices and arrangements impeded diversity, inclusion, and equity despite white administrators' beliefs to the contrary. To help quell systemic racism habits, monthly campus-wide workshops focused on several key racial injustice habits and hurtful microaggressions generated from white privilege. A faux social justice allure to white allies who considered themselves advocates of nondominant people is one that should ultimately call into question the genuineness and true nature of their support.

Gender, race, class, and other social identities render Indigenous and Black women more susceptible and vulnerable to a web of inequalities that inflict violence on their bodies, lands, and communities. In response, Indigenous and Black women have been building grassroots social and environmental justice movements for decades to challenge the legal, political, and corporate agendas that sanction and enable environmental violence in their communities. This article examines the disproportionate social, economic, and health impacts of multiple forms of environmental violence in the lives of Indigenous and Black women in Canada, including low income and poverty, systemic racism in employment and law enforcement, and environmental racism and climate change. The article also calls attention to the transformative human agency of these women by illuminating their legacy of grassroots mobilizing and activism against the various forms of environmental violence in their communities.

The play opened to divergent audience reactions in East Jerusalem, igniting controversy, and leading to the expression of opinions that ranged from absolute support to clear opposition. This article discusses the play's intervention into an orientalist rhetorical context, showing how reversing traditional orientalist ventriloquisms can be employed as a key strategy of cultural resistance. An analysis of the production's choices and the critical responses it generated suggests that by consciously representing Jewish characters who struggle with their own religious and national identities through Palestinian performers, the play opens up the possibility of breaking the perception of balance between the occupier and the occupied. Extended to a larger context, a resistant ventriloquism can reveal systemic oppression, rendering injustices visible in cases where systemic racism prevents the colonizer from seeing the condition of the colonized.

Furthermore, we need to understand and reveal how whiteness has been socially constructed because the power of whiteness lies in its invisibility, and that fuels the perpetuation of systemic racism. In making whiteness visible, we can see how it has been wielded as a weapon, which in turn will allow us to see how destructive it is for everyone, whites included. As part of this work, we need to break down the disciplinary boundary between literary studies and critical race theory (a field within legal studies that examines systemic racism in the context of the law). One example of such an interdisciplinary intervention is to bring together Cheryl Harris, a critical race theorist, and Joyce Carol Oates, a novelist. Harris published one of the foundational pieces of critical race theory in 1993 with her law review article \\u201cWhiteness as Property,\\u201d a legal analysis of whiteness, and Oates produced a masterpiece of American literature in 1980 with her novel Bellefleur, a complex story of a powerful white family that spans seven generations. This pairing lays the groundwork for the type of interdisciplinary dialogue we need because, within literary studies, when the novelist is white and the characters are white, there is still very little emphasis on the study of whiteness even though race is a significant focus of attention when the novelist and characters are people of color. Whiteness is still invisible, and that is part of the problem I am describing, both within literary studies and in our society at large. We need an interdisciplinary intervention to pull back the curtain on whiteness, see how it operates, recognize its danger, and dismantle it. Bringing together Harris and Oates, specifically \\u201cWhiteness as Property\\u201d and Bellefleur, can help us do just that as we work towards achieving justice.

Through preliminary indications from this experimentation high delinquency due to cultural identity and socio-economic status has caused the federal offender population to become diverse. The face of the youth justice system within Canada is rapidly changing. Increasing forms of diversity serves as a principal pattern because the criminalization of minority youth occurs from cultural incompetence, unawareness, and insensitivity. This study recovers the institutional\\/systemic forms of treatment that minority youth face within the criminal justice system. It also further shows that there is no focus on the experiences of minority youth within juvenile correctional facilities due to a lack of information. The examination of criminalized practices, policies and methods of police organizations, correctional institutions and the court of law within Canada reveals institutional racism.

This is justified by the requirement for universities to work towards monitoring and evaluating efforts to create non-discriminatory and inclusive training environments. Methods This study employed qualitative research methods. Ten Black African medical specialists were interviewed about their training experiences in two university training hospitals in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Interview data was collected using open-ended questions and coded and analysed using thematic and critical discursive analysis techniques. Results Four experiential themes emerged from the interview data, they included: 1) experiences of everyday racism during work hours, 2) the physical and psychological effects of tokenism and an increased need to perform, 3) institutional racism as a result of inconsistent and unclear methods of promotion and clinical competence building, and 4) an organisational culture that was experienced as having a race and gender bias. Conclusion This is a pilot study and there are limits on the generalizability of the data due to the small sample. What is clear from our participants, though, is the strong experiential component of finding it challenging to be a Black trainee in a White-dominated profession. We are undertaking further research to explore the issues raised in more detail.

A long history of systemic racism has made these women extremely vulnerable to violent crimes. Most of their fates remain a mystery, but some murderers have been caught who are responsible for their deaths. I examined the news articles that cover the crimes of convicted murderers Robert Pickton and John Martin Crawford. Of the two, only Pickton is very well known. However, while the media covered his crimes extensively, much of the coverage is misleading. The aboriginality of the victims is downplayed, and other tactics are used to blame the victims and focus on the killer. The coverage surrounding John Martin Crawford uses similar misleading strategies, although there is significantly less of it. I argue that because the aboriginality of the victims was emphasized instead of downplayed in the coverage of Crawford\\u2019s murders, there was less interest in the cases. Most people will read about crimes when they can identify with the victims. While most of Pickton\\u2019s victims were aboriginal, the number of victims was so enormous and the details of the case were so grisly, that the aboriginality was downplayed to attract the attention that these other aspects gave the case. Crawford\\u2019s victims were all aboriginal women, but he killed fewer and was not seen as a threat. The media influences how people think about society.

The utility of bystander anti-racism is also demonstrated, with evidence suggesting productive effects for targets and bystanders, as well as perpetrators. The relative merits of confrontational or diplomatic action are reviewed, as is the delicate balance between communicating disapproval and maintaining interpersonal relations. The potential of bystander anti-racism will be enhanced where there are social norms that are intolerant of racism. The literature has paid little attention to the influence of context or to affective drivers of bystander anti-racism. We recommend changes to Ashburn-Nardo's five-stage Confronting Prejudice Model, to better facilitate anti-racism policy and practice. The additions adapt the model to organizational settings, and more strongly acknowledge the importance of social norms and contexts, as well as the specific functions of racism. Through these changes, there is a scope to increase the prominence of bystander anti-racism as a vital element of anti-racism policy. anti-racism; tolerance; racism; bystanders; interpersonal relations; social policy; -  Nelson, Jacqueline; Dunn, Kevin M.\"},{\"id\":\"42f1e1c4aaf4ff87e701b8b8fad47b48d2b17d20f308bde67ccf0493a8982e0a\",\"content\":\"Media event, racial ramblings, or both? An analysis of media coverage of the Tamworth Council Sudanese Refugees Resettlement Case (2006) This article presents our analysis of Australian media reporting of the 2006 Tamworth City Council's decision to refuse the resettlement of five Sudanese families in Tamworth (NSW) and subsequent reversal, supposedly due to the pressure brought to bear on the council as a result of the media 'hype.' The question at the core of our analyses is as follows: Did the media play a role in the over-(re)presentation of this case as racist or was it just a case of the media reporting racism? Informed by media framing theory, we examine print media reports for patterns of presentation as well as representations of both the council and the refugees who were the focus of the reporting. We conclude that while the media played a significant role in making visible a case built on racial stereotypes, their reporting also contained racializing and paternalistic stereotyping that contribute to the reproduction of both everyday and systemic racism.

Despite the widespread coverage that the Hamilton Police Service received as a result of being linked to systemic racist practices, a year later, the Hamilton Police Service was able to avoid being implicated in deliberately conducting racial profiling through strategic tactics in the discourse they relied upon and presented in the media. Through an analysis of 27 local news media articles on the topic of street checks, it is argued that the Police Services and local media discourse enact gaslighting, a form of psychological abuse that is used to manipulate object(s) in order to deceive and undermine the credibility of the target. The psychological effects of gaslighting on people of color included a sense of alienation, disenfranchisement from the community, and distrust toward the police. Through a case study application, it is suggested that gaslighting is part of a systemic, historical process of racism that has been used by the police and government organizations to both illegally target people of color and deny complicity in racial profiling.

The recent murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have prompted a national debate about the need to address systemic racism in policing within the United States. Recent studies have shown how racial resentment has spilled over into a wide range of political issues that are not associated with race; however, no current research examines how racial resentment might shape whites\\u2019 views toward Black Lives Matter. Employing the racial reaction theory and the 2016 American Election Study Survey, we hypothesize and confirm that whites with high levels of racial resentment, conservative ideology, and those who indicated support for Donald Trump hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement. Our results also show that Asians and Hispanics hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement, but that whites have the highest racial resentment levels. The results raise doubts about whether the recent shift in white public opinion is sustainable. Given that racial resentment is a predictor of support for Black Lives Matter, scholars and activists should approach white support for Black Lives Matter with caution because it is likely that increased racial resentment may lead to sustained white opposition to the movement.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

This article is based on a research project conducted in Toronto, Ontario that implemented Aboriginal research methodologies to explore ways to increase collaboration between Aboriginal families, treatment counsellors, and child welfare workers. One significant theme that emerged out of this project was the concept of time as related to policy and legislation that negatively impact Aboriginal pregnant and\\/or parenting women.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement.

Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields.

This article examines the discourses of denial that feature in the talk of local anti-racism actors in Australia, and asks what drives these discourses. The research draws on qualitative interviews undertaken with participants involved in local anti-racism in two case study areas, one in South Australia and the other in New South Wales. This article explores the way local participants in the case study areas deployed four discourses to deny or minimise racism: temporal deflections; spatial deflections; deflections from the mainstream; and absence discourses. Place defending and the desire to protect one's local area from being branded a racist space is discussed as a driver of those local denial discourses. Local denial of racism is also linked to national politics of racism and anti-racism. In particular, the Australian government's retreat from multiculturalism, and the preference for 'harmony' rather than 'anti-racism' initiatives, was linked to the avoidance of the language of racism within participants' responses. The way denial discourses narrow the range of possibilities for local anti-racism is discussed, as is the importance of acknowledgement of racism, particularly institutional and systemic racism. Public acknowledgement of these forms of racism will broaden the scope of local anti-racism.

Across the Americas, the hemispheric parallels undergirding collective resistance to anti-Black racism and state-sanctioned violence lend themselves to multifaceted interdisciplinary scholarly examinations. Using transnational anti-Black racism in Latin America as a point of departure, we advance a theorization of critical race theory in education capable of interrogating racist structures of coloniality, modernity, and White supremacy that operate globally to suppress Black humanity and humanness in general. To that extent, we draw from and reposition critical race theory (CRT) from its sociohistoric heritage in the United States and instead conceptualize transnational anti-Black racism vis-\\u00e0-vis a Black Diaspora reading of CRT. Finally, we return to education as a key site of contestation for transnational anti-Black racism and draw implications for the meaning of this global theorization of CRT in urban education, praxis, and educational research.

Simultaneously, there has been a sevenfold increase in the prison population in the United States, in which African Americans are eight times more likely to be jailed than Whites (Western 2006, p. 3). In this paper, I draw on scholarship in history and sociology, as well as my own anthropological research, to develop the argument that criminal justice policies and immigration policies together disempower low-wage U.S. labor and maintain categorical racial inequalities in a \\u201cpostracial\\u201d United States. First, I review the historical role of race in U.S. immigration policy, and I consider the evidence for systemic racism in immigration enforcement in the contemporary period. Second, I discuss criminal legislation in the neoliberal era and examine the ways in which criminal legislation and immigration policies together disempower large segments of the U.S. workforce, satisfying employer demands for low cost and pliant labor. Finally, I argue that a political focus on immigrant workers' \\u201cillegality\\u201d masks the role of the state in (re)defining the legal status of low-wage workers and veils the ways in which punitive policies maintain historical racial and class inequalities.

Abstract Recent reports on Indigenous education have revealed that high proportions of students have been placed in special classes for intellectual disability or behaviour disorders. This is not an isolated phenomenon. Indigenous students in Canada and Romani children in Europe are also disproportionately represented in special schooling. This paper asks whether systemic racism, which fails to perceive cultural differences between the ethos of Australian educational systems and the experiences and abilities of Indigenous students, is the catalyst for placing many Indigenous students in special schooling, away from the mainstream. The paper applies an analysis based on anti-discrimination law to argue that while allocation on the basis of intellectual disability or behaviour disorders may not be deliberate racism, the criteria developed for the allocation may be measuring conformity to the dominant culture. If the policies underlying this segregation are unreasonable in the circumstances, they could constitute indirect racial discrimination against Indigenous students. Educational authorities could be liable in law, even though the effect on Indigenous students is unintentional and said to be for the students\\u2019 \\u201cown good\\u201d.

These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism.

First, it argues that communities of opportunity should be developed to minimize some of the adverse impacts of systemic racism. These are communities that provide early childhood development resources, implement policies to reduce childhood poverty, provide work and income support opportunities for adults, and ensure healthy housing and neighborhood conditions. Second, the healthcare system needs new emphases on ensuring access to high quality care for all, strengthening preventive health care approaches, addressing patients\\u2019 social needs as part of healthcare delivery, and diversifying the healthcare work force to more closely reflect the demographic composition of the patient population. Finally, new research is needed to identify the optimal strategies to build political will and support to address social inequities in health. This will include initiatives to raise awareness levels of the pervasiveness of inequities in health, build empathy and support for addressing inequities, enhance the capacity of individuals and communities to actively participate in intervention efforts and implement large scale efforts to reduce racial prejudice, ideologies, and stereotypes in the larger culture that undergird policy preferences that initiate and sustain inequities. race; racism; ethnicity; inequities; disparities; interventions; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 16, Iss 4, p 606 (2019) David R.

Owing to its roots in the environmental justice movement, addressing systemic racism is central to climate justice praxis in the United States, which is a necessary intervention in typically technocratic climate politics. What emerges from US climate justice is a moral appeal to \\u2018relationship\\u2019 as politics, the procedural demand that communities of color (the \\u2018frontline\\u2019) lead the movement, and a distributive claim on carbon pricing revenue. However, this praxis precludes a critique of racial capitalism, the process that relies on structural racism to enhance accumulation, alienating, exploiting, and immiserating black, brown, and white, while carrying out ecocide. The lack of an analysis of how class and race produce the crises climate justice confronts prevents the movement from demanding that global north fossil fuel abolition occur in tandem with the reassertion of the public over the private and de-growth.

Self-reflection has emerged through the teacher-as-researcher and the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner identities in professional development. However, this looking inward avoids looking at the larger social structures and the ways in which knowledge of the self is built on social constructions of knowledge and a privileged identity that marginalizes and oppresses Others. I argue that this distraction on\\/from the self creates a meritocracy in professional development. A focus on the inward self allows perpetuations of systemic racism to remain entrenched and unchallenged in schooling, further pushing anti-racist work to the margins and the ideal of the inclusive classroom unobtainable.

Then, parent knowledge was shared with a group of pre-service teachers. Results reveal some pre-service teachers encouraged the use of students\\u2019 first language in their practicum whereas others internalized their monolingual ideology despite multilingual realities.

Without personal connections to Indigenous communities, many Canadians fail to grasp the depth of intergenerational impacts of residential schools and associated systemic racism. Consequently, reconciliation remains an elusive concept. Here we outline 10 Calls to Action to natural scientists to enable reconciliation in their work. We focus on natural scientists because a common connection to the land should tie the social license of natural scientists more closely to Indigenous communities than currently exists. We also focus on natural sciences because of the underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in this field. We draw on existing guidelines and our experiences in northern Canada. Our 10 Calls to Action are triggered by frustration. The authors have witnessed examples where natural scientists treat Indigenous communities with blatant disrespect or with ignorance of Indigenous rights. These 10 Calls to Action challenge the scientific community to recognize that reconciliation requires a new way of conducting natural science, one that includes and respects Indigenous communities, rights, and knowledge leading to better scientific and community outcomes.

This attack came on the heels of months of online abuse from trolls on Twitter, most recently lead by Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos. Through a multiplatform discourse analysis of the Leslie Jones hack, this paper examines the connections between platform vulnerabilities and the vulnerabilities of women, as well as the links between the rise of the alt-right and the mainstreaming of racist, misogynistic trolling behaviors. Building on Whitney Phillips\\u2019s (2015) arguments about the connections between trolling and mainstream culture, this case study maps a moment when these subcultural behaviors were becoming more dominant and provides a microcosm through which to understand the interconnectedness between digital platforms, politics and Politics, race, and gender. Utilizing a qualitative interpretation of Jean Burgess and Ariadna Matamoros-Fern\\u00e1ndez\\u2019s (2016) multiplatform issue mapping, three key themes emerged: messages of support and affirmation; the need for intervention; and the connection between this incident, systemic racism and sexism, and the rise of the alt-right. Overall, the discourse around Leslie Jones\\u2019s hack evinces the mainstreaming of both policy discourse around online harassment and the supposedly subcultural trolling culture that frequently aligns with the alt-right. While other instances of online harassment have garnered significant media attention, the hatred toward Jones surfaced at a cultural and political tipping point, speaking to larger political divides within the United States. celebrity; critical discourse analysis; race; gender; sexuality AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research; 2017: AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research ; 2162-3317 Lawson, Caitlin\"},{\"id\":\"dafd171b76d3b5d172693066f2fe12ec32e24895a4ba31e722555f5fbf01c154\",\"content\":\"A systematic review of empirical research on self-reported racism and health This paper reviews 138 empirical quantitative population-based studies of self-reported racism and health.

Specifically, I explore why more black women did not engage in the national debate about abortion in the wake of the 1976 Hyde Amendment, even when restrictive abortion legislation had a disproportionately negative effect on them. Historically, scholarship has focused either on women\\u2019s liberation and feminism, or on civil rights and black liberation. This paper, however, connects those themes using an intersectional approach by examining reproductive justice in terms of women\\u2019s multiple, intersecting identities, especially race, class, and gender. This multidimensional identity complicated black women\\u2019s involvement in the second wave feminist movement, leading to a so-called \\u201cconspiracy of silence.\\u201d Primary sources, including feminist publications, interviews, and autobiographies reveal that black women were largely absent from the mainstream pro-choice feminist discourse and mobilizations in the 1970s.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 2006\\/07 with 153 Aboriginal people living in Adelaide, Australia. Participants were asked about their experience of, and responses to, racism, and the impact of these experiences on their health. Racism was regularly experienced by 93% of participants. Almost two thirds of people felt that racism affected their health. Using a thematic analysis with a particular focus on how agency and structure interacted, a number of key reactions and responses to racism were identified. These included: emotional and physiological reactions; and responses such as gaining support from social networks; confronting the person\\/situation; ignoring it; avoiding situations where they might experience racism; 'minimising' the significance or severity of racism or questioning whether incidents were racist; and consuming alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. A further theme was a conscious decision to not 'allow' racism to affect health. Our study found that most people used more than one of these coping strategies, and that strategies were selected with an awareness of positive and negative health impacts. While individuals demonstrated substantial agency in their responses, there were clear structural constraints on how they reacted and responded. We found that not only was racism potentially detrimental to health, but so too were some responses. However, while some strategies appeared 'healthier' than others, most strategies entailed costs and benefits, and these depended on the meanings of responses for individuals. This paper concludes that initiatives to promote health-protective responses to racism need to consider structural constraints and the overarching goal of reducing systemic racism.

This is a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is systematically infecting Black, Indigenous, and People of Color and when there has been increased attention to systemic racism and intersecting violence inherent in multiple systems, including the justice, health, and educational systems. Using Kilbourne et al. (2016) framework, this special issue focuses on Phase 2 and Phase 3 research. Rather than only identifying health disparities (Phase 1), this issue focuses on understanding mechanisms and translating such understanding into interventions and policy changes. The accepted articles span a wide gamut from obesity to autism to rural populations. Furthermore, the articles provide methods for advancing the field beyond simply noting that systematic differences exist toward strategies to address these inequities. We conclude this introduction by discussing next steps for future research, with hopes that it inspires the next generation to study issues of disparities and inequity in deeper, more meaningful, and impactful ways.

Methods Data are from a nationally representative sample of older community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries from the 2015 (N = 5,212) National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). We use stepwise multinomial logistic regression to examine black-white disparities in moves out of community housing to assisted living or a nursing home over 2 years, before and after adjusting for predisposing (age, gender), enabling (income, housing tenure, Medicaid, living arrangement) and need (activities of daily living [ADL] limitation, physical capacity, self-rated health, and dementia) factors. Results Black older adults are less likely to move to assisted living and are more likely to move to a nursing home compared to white older adults. Black-white disparities in moves to nursing homes are explained by black-white differences in enabling and need factors, whereas black-white disparities in moves to assisted living remain even after adjusting for enabling and need factors. Discussion Unmeasured factors related to systemic racism (e.g., residential racial segregation, racial discrimination) and\\/or black-white differences in care preferences might further explain black-white disparities in moves to assisted living and warrant further investigation.

Discrepancies Between Medical Education and Conception Objective: This preliminary study examined the differences between what was taught during a formal medical education and medical students\\u2019 and psychiatry residents\\u2019 conceptions of notions regarding the causes and determinants of mental illness. Methods: The authors surveyed 74 medical students and 11 residents via convenience sampling. The survey contained 18 statements which were rated twice based on truthfulness in terms of a participant\\u2019s formal education and conception, respectively. Descriptive statistics and a Wilcoxon signed rank test determined differences between education and conception. Results: Results showed that students were less likely to perceive a neurotransmitter imbalance to cause mental illness, as opposed to what was emphasized during a formal medical education. Students and residents also understood the importance of factors such as systemic racism and socioeconomic status in the development of mental illness, which were factors that did not receive heavy emphasis during medical education. Furthermore, students and residents believed that not only did mental illnesses have nonuniform pathologies, but that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders also had the propensity to sometimes arbitrarily categorize individuals with potentially negative consequences. Conclusions: If these notions are therefore part of students\\u2019 and residents\\u2019 conceptions, as well as documented in the literature, then it seems appropriate for medical education to be further developed to emphasize these ideas.

Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

It has raised awareness about systemic racism and sexism as well as social and economic conditions experienced by Canada's Indigenous population. Yet, research shows that Indigenous males are the most likely to be murdered in Canada (Mulligan, Axford, & Soecki, 2016). Since Indigenous men are going missing and are murdered in disturbing numbers, and they are fathers, brothers, and sons to Indigenous women and girls, it is understandable that many in the Indigenous community wanted to include them in the inquiry. Our analysis explores how the MMIWG and discourses about inclusion and exclusion have been framed in ways that limit interpretations about the root causes of problems experienced by Indigenous people, especially when they exclude an important part of the Indigenous population\\u2014Indigenous males. We draw upon Indigenous perceptions of the inquiry and analyses of social norms and stereotypes in order to explore the conflicting positions and experiences associated with missing and murdered Indigenous people in Canada. We conclude by exploring the need for a more comprehensive inquiry. We recognize that a holistic model of inquiry that honours the voices of Indigenous communities is crucial to a proper investigation into missing and murdered Indigenous people in Canada.

Though some critique disparities through a structural lens, others use deficit discourse, blaming families of color and working-class families for educational outcomes. This study examines how state policy insiders explain educational inequity, shedding light on the complex relationship between language and the maintenance of systemic racism and classism in education. Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity. These strategies allowed some policy insiders to strengthen deficit discourse, divert attention from structural issues, and characterize themselves positively while advancing racist and classist ideas. These findings have compelling implications in terms of possibilities for policy changes supportive of educational equity. policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class education policy analysis archives; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; archivos analiticos de politicas educativas; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; Arquivos Anal\\u00edticos de Pol\\u00edticas Educativas; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; 1068-2341 Bertrand, Melanie; Perez, Wendy Y.; Rogers, John\"},{\"id\":\"ceb5f2147b4ab177218ab7d08b9c76a7b745adfa13c3930c65fad7dcf126d60f\",\"content\":\"Racial residential segregation, socioeconomic disparities, and the White-Black survival gap. To evaluate the association between racial residential segregation, a prominent manifestation of systemic racism, and the White-Black survival gap in a contemporary cohort of adults, and to assess the extent to which socioeconomic inequality explains this association.This was a cross sectional study of White and Black men and women aged 35-75 living in 102 large US Core Based Statistical Areas. The main outcome was the White-Black survival gap. We used 2009-2013 CDC mortality data for Black and White men and women to calculate age-, sex- and race adjusted White and Black mortality rates. We measured segregation using the Dissimilarity index, obtained from the Manhattan Institute. We used the 2009-2013 American Community Survey to define indicators of socioeconomic inequality. We estimated the CBSA-level White-Black gap in probability of survival using sequential linear regression models accounting for the CBSA dissimilarity index and race-specific socioeconomic indicators.Black men and women had a 14% and 9% lower probability of survival from age 35 to 75 than their white counterparts. Residential segregation was strongly associated with the survival gap, and this relationship was partly, but not fully, explained by socioeconomic inequality. At the lowest observed level of segregation, and with the Black socioeconomic status (SES) assumed to be at the White SES level scenario, the survival gap is essentially eliminated.White-Black differences in survival remain wide notwithstanding public health efforts to improve life expectancy and initiatives to reduce health disparities. Eliminating racial residential segregation and bringing Black socioeconomic status (SES) to White SES levels would eliminate the White-Black survival gap.

The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities\\u2014specifically racism\\u2014and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research.

However, the conceptualization of healthy aging and how age-related issues are addressed in community-based structures, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities, remain poorly understood, especially from the Stakeholder perspective. Stakeholders, such as faith leaders and members of community-based organizations, engage in regular negotiations to advance health equity in their communities by partnering and collaborating with older adults and their families as well as other local and federal organizations. The Stakeholder Engagement in Aging Research and Community Health (SEARCH) Study employs multiple research methods to illuminate Stakeholders\\u2019 perspectives on barriers and facilitators to healthy aging in diverse communities. This presentation highlights findings from in-depth, qualitative interviews with Stakeholders (N=37) serving African American, Latinx, and South Asian older adults. Emergent themes suggest that systemic racism, stigmatization, limited health literacy, and cultural beliefs serve as barriers to healthy aging across groups. Within groups, Stakeholders report precarious immigration status and fragile and fragmented life situations as barriers among Latinx older adults, while acculturative stress presents a challenge to healthy aging in South Asian older adults. Food insecurity and neighborhood factors such as exposure to violence and socio-economic disadvantages act as barriers among African American older adults. Conversely, religious faith and spirituality, familial support, and culturally-congruent care serve as facilitators across groups. The findings from this study underscore the continued need for intersectional, inclusive, and culturally-informed approaches to supporting healthy aging within diverse communities.

Materials and Methods Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis, and COVID test results.

A distinction is made between \\u201cmacro\\u201d and \\u201cmicro\\u201d racism. Examples of interpersonal and systemic racism in Canada are considered in the context of multicultural policies and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Changes in Canadian immigration law and regulations are examined and their implications for refugee movements reviewed. It is concluded that there are unintended consequences of stricter control over borders and the \\u201cfaster, fairer, firmer\\u201d treatment of asylum-seekers, that constitute institutional racism. ; L\\u2019article commence par d\\u00e9finir les termes \\u00ab race \\u00bb et \\u00ab racisme \\u00bb et retrace l\\u2019historique de leur utilisation au Canada depuis la Conf\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration.

The dominant discourses around these issues focus on and often seek to silence racism or diminish its occurrence in the society, in other words: deflections and denial of racism dominate. Such denials and deflections belie the lived experiences of racism among racial(ised) minorities. Perhaps not surprisingly therefore, within such a context, there is a paucity of research on how community development practice engages with issues of race, racialisation, racism and racial inequalities. Little is known about how community development practitioners work with\\/in racially diverse communities or the extent to which Australian community development practice employs a \\u2018race lense\\u2019 in its practice. The discussions in this paper therefore emanate from an understanding that \\u2018colour (race)-blind\\u2019 practice still dominates community development work in Australia. The main contention is that unexamined colour-blind practice has the potential to reproduce systemic racism or systems of racial inequalities. The question informing this paper therefore, is: what is the significance of race in community development practice in Australia? To address this question, the paper centres \\u201cthe experienced reality of lived racism\\u201d (Essed, 1991, p. vii) by black African migrants in Australia - which highlight the pervasiveness of racism in their everyday lives - to argue the need for conversations and considerations about race and inclusion within the field of community development. In the end, the discussions in this paper will raise important questions about the significance of race in community development practice in Australia and the consequences of race-blind practice and colour-mutism when working with\\/in ethnic and racially diverse communities. Perhaps more importantly, the paper contributes to \\u2018courageous conversations\\u2019 about how community development practitioners can work effectively across ethnic and racial boundaries without (re)producing systemic structures of racial inequalities.

Engaging theories of settler-colonialism, decolonization and Indigenous studies, we outline the obstacles and struggles in settler teacher education, such as exposing the legacies of colonialism in education, cultural harms and systemic racism in curriculum, and ongoing ignorance as entitlement by teachers. In addition, we focus on the complexities of methods for improving respectful relationality with Indigenous students and community as well as our hopes in helping new teachers commit their professional practice to focus on supporting Indigenous children and youth.

Improving the hospital care for Indigenous people is critical in improving health outcomes. This paper provides the results from a facilitated discussion on the disparities in acute hospital care and workforce issues. The workshop was held in Alice Springs, Australia at the second Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) Indigenous Cardiovascular Health Conference. Critical issues to be addressed include: addressing systemic racism; reconfiguring models of care to address the needs of Indigenous people; cultural competence training for all health professionals; increasing participation of Indigenous people in the health workforce; improving information systems and facilitating communication across the health care sector and with Indigenous communities.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach Historical literature review was conducted to trace the genesis of the alleged racialised job hopping phenomenon. Melissa Steyn\\u2019s (2015) idea of Critical Diversity Literacy was also applied to critically examine the implicit power dynamics, strengths, limitations and biases involved in the construction, valorisation, circulation and contestation of this dominant narrative. Findings The authors found the popular racialised job hopping phenomenon to be an overgeneralisation that lacks credible evidence. It ignores multiple variables that are crucial in studying employee turnover behaviour. Research limitations\\/implications The paper is conceptual. It is mainly based on critical literature reviews. Empirical studies could be undertaken within this domain in the future to confirm or disconfirm some of the findings of this paper. Practical implications These allegations are emblematic of the endemic systemic racism in South Africa\\u2019s corporate labour market that remains an enclave of whiteness. Social implications Race is a highly contentious phenomenon and a major field of social inequality. Black bodies confront numerous challenges that undermine their human rights and opportunities to participate meaningfully in society and the economy. This paper calls for organisations to play an active role in healing racial divisions and building social cohesion by critically examining, challenging and changing discourses that propel inequality. Originality\\/value By addressing one of critical socio-economic and political issues confronting the world\\u2019s most unequal society, the paper hopes to stimulate healthy debate that can bring real change for marginalised groups in workplaces.
