As the United States navigates a social awakening, primary care providers (PCPs) need to join the movement by addressing the impact of racism on our society. As community leaders, all PCPs, including medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, physician assistants, and advanced practice nurses, are morally called to combat systemic racism. PCPs need to consider how traditional treatment modalities, such as drug prescription and lifestyle modifications, may perpetuate systemic racism and inflict further injustice upon the health of Black Americans. Furthermore, as physical healers, PCPs are professionally bound to address systemic racism as its detrimental physical effects ravage those marginalized by our racialized society.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Primary health care; Racism in medicine; Racism; Physicians--Professional ethics; Bioethics; Hippocratic oath (Hippocrates)\",\"subject\":\"Primary health care; Racism in medicine; Racism; Physicians--Professional ethics; Bioethics; Hippocratic oath (Hippocrates)\",\"authors\":\"Chaucer, Katie; DeTurk, Monika\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7916\\/d8-yvzp-tq90\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"57a3df147451c74b881b8f16f03903433f827112b000dbced3d6d9de705892b0\",\"relevance\":120,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7916\\/d8-yvzp-tq90\"},{\"id\":\"1fc8d695587b2994ea35dd74b89b6e5c67152554a7a8bed5b4f9ded55bf28a36\",\"relation\":\"Teachers College Record; Mutegi, J., Phelps-Moultrie, J., & Pitts Bannister, V.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach This essay weaves together popular press articles, academic writings and the authors' lived experiences to summarize, clarify and extend the work needed inside of organizations and academia to dismantle systemic racism.

Research limitations\\/implications While there is a critical need for more antiracism research, there are standards and guidelines that should be followed to conduct that research responsibly with antiracism enacted in research design, methodology decisions and publication practices.

Systemic racism, practiced through institutionalized policies and customary behaviour affecting people working in organizations, results in inequality for some groups and privileges for others. Since 2002 the CAF has been covered by the federal Employment Equity Act whose purpose is to address systemic discrimination by requiring employers to remove and prevent systemic barriers to equality for Indigenous people, women and \\u201cvisible minorities\\u201d and to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the Canadian population. Aside from its legal obligation, it is in the interest of the CAF to recruit and retain Indigenous People because they are an essential part of Canada\\u2019s labour supply. However Indigenous members of the CAF comprise a small and marginalized minority within a rigid, bureaucratic and culturally foreign organization.Implementing the Employment Equity Act could assist the CAF to address the Canadian state\\u2019s promise of reconciliation, fairness and equality for Indigenous people. This chapter reviews available evidence bearing on the CAF\\u2019s employment equity record, which presents a pattern of resistance to the Act\\u2019s requirements and failure to progress toward a representative workforce. In the absence of effective action to implement change, the CAF has yet to find a path from systemic racism toward employment equity for Indigenous People.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Military and Strategic Studies; Vol 19 No 2 (2018) ; 1488-559X\",\"year\":\"2019-02-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Agocs, Carol\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/jmss.org\\/article\\/view\\/62832\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8bb7e92184da939b857a68d9719f0b81bdd2d5d1ad6d282db99d73f6815e30d7\",\"relevance\":111,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"4951bb4566853e80dfa0c939c1fbae5b165f4c0cce1115964871b3cc1cab40d7\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.openedition.org\\/communication\\/10766; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1189-3788; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1920-7344; 1189-3788; 1920-7344; doi:10.4000\\/communication.10766; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/1e31d18e47fa427b84590a78b8e291fe\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.4000\\/communication.10766; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/1e31d18e47fa427b84590a78b8e291fe\",\"title\":\"Id\\u00e9ologie raciste et fiction t\\u00e9l\\u00e9visuelle\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Starting from the hypothesis that the media contributes to a form of systemic racism, the author explores the ways racist ideology is manifested in Spanish T.V. sitcoms.

The ideal model for an unbiased homeless system would distribute assistance such that it is received in equal percentages across racial\\/ethnic groups as the percent of that racial group experiencing homelessness. One of the consequences of systemic racism is an overrepresentation of people of color among those who experience homelessness. Black people make up 11% of the general population of Western New York but they account for 25% of the people in poverty and 47% of the homeless population. When the number of people who experience homelessness are compared against the number of people who are in poverty, Black people living in poverty are 3 times more likely to experience homelessness compared to White people. These suggest that poverty rates alone do not explain the over-representation, but that systemic racism blunts the ability of people of color to recover from financial catastrophe to avoid homelessness relative to those who are White. ; wny_racial_disparities_2018.pdf: 20 downloads, before Oct. 1, 2020.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-10-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"housing; neighborhoods; buffalo; poverty; inequality; homelessness\",\"subject\":\"housing; neighborhoods; buffalo; poverty; inequality; homelessness\",\"authors\":\"Homeless Alliance of Western New York\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1813\\/73606\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"2004d9120be3bb4a6a10e0d4443961dd6cbd546a28099c13bd0135244abba42e\",\"relevance\":106,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"053512bfd4c3e9569b324a26ce97d820c1be3e02e2c7387d6a2a64b22b3b314f\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/espace.cdu.edu.au\\/view\\/cdu:8475\",\"title\":\"Experiences of racism among urban Indigenous Australians: findings from the DRUID study\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Although Indigenous people continue to experience racism in contemporary Australian society, we know little about the nature of such experiences.

Africana people have made strides at all levels of the American government. Africana people were a vital voting block that helped to elect the first American President of African descent. However, studies have shown that the conditions of Africana people in America have not substantially changed since the Voting Rights Act of 1 965 was enacted. Africana political participation has not equated to socioeconomic equality on a large scale for the Africana community. Utilizing Feagin's Systemic Racism Theory, this project looks to examine why solely relying upon the American political system is symptomatic of disagency for Africana people and argues that this dis-agency does not empower our people to seek solutions. It places the power to liberate in the oppressor's hands, thus maintaining the inequality that continues to exist in America. This article also argues for Africana people to look to themselves as the avenue for addressing the societal ills that it faces. It also argues that Africana people must be their own mechanism for liberation. In addition, the terms Africana and Black will be used interchangeably in the project because those terms are most readily identifiable to people of African descent living in America.\",\"published_in\":\"Ethnic Studies Review ; volume 36, issue 1, page 139-147 ; ISSN 1555-1881\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Simmons, Matthew\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/esr.2013.36.1.139\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a8d370f48317ac68b7687e6927e388cc040a12af636ee77c0f911de5d36473c7\",\"relevance\":94,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/esr.2013.36.1.139\"},{\"id\":\"e167ac70591530ad6c5e0a528b74ba82901d1786d1320152498c1ddbc413c373\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.lib.uwo.ca\\/index.php\\/si\\/article\\/view\\/10629\\/8555; https:\\/\\/ojs.lib.uwo.ca\\/index.php\\/si\\/article\\/view\\/10629\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.lib.uwo.ca\\/index.php\\/si\\/article\\/view\\/10629\",\"title\":\"The War on Drugs: Systemic Racism Perpetuated in the Name of Clean Streets\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Despite the fact that drug use among African Americans and whites is statistically very similar, the amount of African Americans incarcerated is much higher, making up about 40% of the American Prison population while only making up 12.6% of the entire American population (Harris et al. 2009:1). These statistics represent a clear disparity between whites and African Americans in the criminal justice system and give valid reason to be concerned about the effects of mass incarceration and the war on drugs on African American communities (Bobo and Johnson 2004). This paper will draw from conflict theory to argue that the methods employed to fight the war on drugs in America (whether purposefully or not) work to deplete social welfare of African American communities through the use of discriminatory rhetoric, increasingly harsh and racially targeted policies, and prejudicial enforcement and mobilization of these policies, which reinforce existing systems of control and domination in North American society. Possible strategies that may be implemented to remediate this issue include shifting focus from supply reduction strategies (which mainly function to punish offenders) to demand reduction strategies which aim to persuade people not to use or buy drugs, through education and drug abuse treatment (Tonry 1994:66), including integrated public health-public safety strategies (Marlowe 2003).\",\"published_in\":\"The Sociological Imagination: Undergraduate Journal; Vol 6 No 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-13\",\"subject_orig\":\"war on drugs; racism; systemic racism; justice system; criminal justice system; mass incarceration; drug crime; drug crimes; policing; criminology\",\"subject\":\"war on drugs; racism; systemic racism; justice system; criminal justice system; mass incarceration; drug crime; drug crimes; policing; criminology\",\"authors\":\"Boghosian, Mileva\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.lib.uwo.ca\\/index.php\\/si\\/article\\/view\\/10629\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"e167ac70591530ad6c5e0a528b74ba82901d1786d1320152498c1ddbc413c373\",\"relevance\":93,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"d5b04c690b1dd4a6a304a9d74cadea36e06ea4799450cb6df2465633046b0d48\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2077-1444\\/9\\/11\\/370; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2077-1444; 2077-1444; doi:10.3390\\/rel9110370; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9bd177baae814ff9bebc03512dd9f778\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/rel9110370; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9bd177baae814ff9bebc03512dd9f778\",\"title\":\"How Levinas Can (and Cannot) Help Us with Political Apology in the Context of Systemic Racism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"What is the structure of an apology?

This essay will consider Emmanuel Levinas\\u2019s work and how it relates to this notion of a political apology. In some respects, Levinas\\u2019s thought is profoundly constructive and useful; however, his ahistorical, asymmetrical account of intersubjectivity is inadequate to explain what an apology seeks to achieve on a substantial political level.

Similar to large institutions, human service agencies may maintain racism due to established patterns of Eurocentricity. Agencies also function as entities where change can be affected. The following case study is about the process of decentering whiteness at a feminist health organisation located in an urban centre in the United States. The author, a white, non-binary woman, serving on the board of directors, offered to present a graduate paper at an agency-wide meeting. Preparations for this presentation evolved into a year-long process, during which time the agency began to grapple with the limitations of a cultural competence framework in its services for women\\u2019s and trans health.Feminist intersectionality theory is used to examine the organisation\\u2019s steps towards facing its Eurocentricity. This case study provides examples from organisational practice, during a year of racial turbulence, to explore three strategies that human service agencies commonly use to avoid confronting internal issues of race. It deconstructs past events in which staff maintained systemic racism through (1) disowning past harm, (2) suppression of criticism, and (3) deflection of responsibility through white feminine fragility.A narrative of events is analysed with the support of scholarship to explore how an intersectional approach can address gaps in the flawed implementation of a cultural competence framework. Intersectionality theory can transform ways of thinking among human service providers to promote critical analysis of racism within agency settings. This framework also shows the connection between systemic racism and the delegitimisation of individuals, an essential concept to the task of decentering whiteness within human service organisations.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Work & Policy Studies: Social Justice, Practice and Theory; Vol 3, No 1 (2020): Beyond \\\"Cultural Competency\\\": Confronting Whiteness in Social Work ; 2209-0878\",\"year\":\"2020-05-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Miller, Berg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/openjournals.library.usyd.edu.au\\/index.php\\/SWPS\\/article\\/view\\/14287\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d69d9d60b745a94509fb8da91a33d0c0f64311e54e676f447742e09d9a5bdc92\",\"relevance\":91,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"fa537b5d3c054d090ee91ce128ad2fca1c79772511a9701a645224b0c1e32118\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.lib.uoguelph.ca\\/index.php\\/perj\\/article\\/view\\/5348; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1911-9593; doi:10.21083\\/partnership.v15i1.5348; 1911-9593; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a2bcf82628c74bfe9c5e731e123470f7\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21083\\/partnership.v15i1.5348; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a2bcf82628c74bfe9c5e731e123470f7\",\"title\":\"Racialized youth in the public library: Systemic racism through a critical theory lens\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Public libraries are on the frontline of serving underprivileged groups like racialized youth and help them to mitigate social inequities that manifest in negative outcomes like education gaps, underemployment and access to safe and affordable housing. Although racialized youth account for half of the youth population in Canadian cities like Toronto, their experience in public libraries is an unstudied area of Canadian LIS scholarly and professional research. Existing research approaches youth as a homogenous group in terms of age and biological stages and does not account for race, class, and urbanism. However, racialized youth face different challenges in which race and systemic racism are a facet of everyday life. This work aims to reverse racial neutrality in public libraries by demonstrating how ambivalence about race perpetuates systemic inequalities and the disengagement of racialized youth. It draws on interdisciplinary research to show how the race-blind approach is not reflective of the needs of communities being served. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, it shows that public libraries can implement processes to gather race-specific data under the recently-implemented Anti-Racism Act (2017). This will provide a contextual understanding of the racial make-up of users and provide a valuable frame of reference to support efforts to build stronger and more effective relationships.\",\"published_in\":\"Partnership: The Canadian Journal of Library and Information Practice and Research, Vol 15, Iss 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Public Libraries; Racialized Youth; Critical Race Theory; Anti-Racism; Bibliography.

Clinicians, restaurant cooks, cashiers, transit operators, and other essential workers (EWs), however, continued to work outside the home during this time in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society. In the United States, EWs are often low-income persons of color who are more likely to face socioeconomic vulnerabilities, systemic racism, and health inequities. To assess the various impacts of COVID-19 on EWs, an online survey was distributed to a representative sample of individuals residing in six states during May\\/June 2020. The sample included 990 individuals who identified as EWs and 736 nonessential workers (NWs). We assessed differences between EW and NW respondents according to three categories related to health equity and social determinants of health: (1) demographics (e.g. race\\/ethnicity); (2) COVID-19 exposure risk pathways (e.g. ability to social distance); and (3) COVID-19 risk perceptions (e.g. perceived risk of contracting COVID-19). EWs were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than NWs and also had lower incomes and education levels on average. Unsurprisingly, EWs were substantially more likely to report working outside the home and less likely to report social distancing and wearing masks indoors as compared to NWs. EWs also perceived a slightly greater risk of contracting COVID-19.

Through exploring current policies that aim to improve mental health and social and emotional wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander peoples; distinguishing the difference between cultural competence and cultural humility and the need for cultural humility; breaking down the construction of mental illness; and drawing on the Uti Kulintjaku project the need for a new way of thinking about mental health service provision for Indigenous peoples in Australian will be explored.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Work & Policy Studies: Social Justice, Practice and Theory; Vol 2, No 2 (2019): Student Edition ; 2209-0878\",\"year\":\"2020-02-06\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Rhodes, Lila\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/openjournals.library.usyd.edu.au\\/index.php\\/SWPS\\/article\\/view\\/14182\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"814235c3d2c9c977cea3f89a1c333bf4e239a67319bc41b0b9e8728700167900\",\"relevance\":86,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"239dd29e21240cf942cc69a89a5366ba616f1885fe2e4b1a7ac9d649c34ff993\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/crco.cssd.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/1515\\/1\\/The%20Racist%20Case%20for%20Diversity.pdf; Cornford, Tom (2019) The Racist Case for Diversity?

An analysis of the production's choices and the critical responses it generated suggests that by consciously representing Jewish characters who struggle with their own religious and national identities through Palestinian performers, the play opens up the possibility of breaking the perception of balance between the occupier and the occupied.

Finally, I connect the struggle involving racism as a contested concept to two larger racial ideologies: color-blindness and systemic racism.\",\"published_in\":\"Critical Sociology ; volume 32, issue 2-3, page 255-274 ; ISSN 0896-9205 1569-1632\",\"year\":\"2006\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sociology and Political Science\",\"subject\":\"Sociology and Political Science\",\"authors\":\"Doane, Ashley\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/156916306777835303\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"229f95d1b7725af5fe27f5b1119603f2b258253e6b6726675a12d471bdc04f1c\",\"relevance\":73,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/156916306777835303\"},{\"id\":\"5deec76d041c44d8dc729d7f95b147277ea4130a9e245487add6d0f7786a7b90\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1360780420922247; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/1360780420922247; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/1360780420922247\",\"title\":\"A Qualitative Analysis of the Vulnerability Narratives of Student Gun Rights Advocates\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In recent years, colleges and universities in the United States have considered allowing concealed firearms on their campuses.

Gender, race, class, and other social identities render Indigenous and Black women more susceptible and vulnerable to a web of inequalities that inflict violence on their bodies, lands, and communities. In response, Indigenous and Black women have been building grassroots social and environmental justice movements for decades to challenge the legal, political, and corporate agendas that sanction and enable environmental violence in their communities. This article examines the disproportionate social, economic, and health impacts of multiple forms of environmental violence in the lives of Indigenous and Black women in Canada, including low income and poverty, systemic racism in employment and law enforcement, and environmental racism and climate change.

The Black Lives Matter meme and movement are prominent responses to racism that have animated intense interest and support, especially among African Americans. We summarize recent social science research on Black Lives Matter. As a first step toward understanding the social psychology of the meme and the movement, we apply the dynamic dual-pathway model of protest to Black Lives Matter.

Psychology tells us that shoplifting is a mental deficiency manifested in women as \\u201ckleptomania\\u201d (Abelson 4). Given the subsequent international growth of shoplifting, we argue instead that shoplifting is in many ways condoned in contemporary culture: used as a form of social and political control in a late capitalist society. This article first turns to female consumers as shoplifters in the late nineteenth century, alongside the growth of mass production, large-scale department stores, and visually spectacular forms of display. In line with feminist critiques of Marx\\u2019s Capital, we uphold the conditions prescribed to women under capitalism and extend this argument to newer forms of systemic racism in the consumer sphere, which ensure that women of colour and of lower economic standing face even greater obstacles to success. Using a broad historical view, we analyze the act of shoplifting in two forms of cultural media, both set in Paris. The first is \\u00c9mile Zola\\u2019s novel The Ladies\\u2019 Paradise (1883), based on Paris\\u2019s first department store, Le Bon March\\u00e9. Due to Zola\\u2019s commitment to verisimilitude, we argue, his work offers the strongest corroboration of the ways in which new forms of visual display and a new class of psychologically-entitled females worked together to generate astounding accounts of theft. Our analysis then turns to a work of cinema produced nearly a century and a half later, C\\u00e9line Sciamma\\u2019s 2014 Girlhood. Sciamma portrays a group of young French African girls who navigate their paths into adulthood from the vantage of Bagnolet, a lower income immigrant suburb over four kilometers from Paris\\u2019s city centre. The girls experience racial profiling and demonstrate varying forms of resistance, one of them shoplifting. While shoplifting then appears to be an enduring weapon of the weak and strategy of resistance by the dispossessed, leading to, not surprisingly, tacitly permissibility for white middle class women and harsher consequences for women of colour, we conclude that the activity is leveraged to perpetuate pre-existent forms of gendered social control and cultural stereotyping.\",\"published_in\":\"Fashion Studies, Vol 2, Iss 1, Pp 1-39 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"shoplifting; shopping; consumer culture; deviance; resistance; race; gender; Visual arts; N1-9211\",\"subject\":\"shoplifting; shopping; consumer culture; deviance; resistance; race; gender; Visual arts; \",\"authors\":\"Evangeline Holtz Schramek; Carolyn L.

Furthermore, we need to understand and reveal how whiteness has been socially constructed because the power of whiteness lies in its invisibility, and that fuels the perpetuation of systemic racism. In making whiteness visible, we can see how it has been wielded as a weapon, which in turn will allow us to see how destructive it is for everyone, whites included. As part of this work, we need to break down the disciplinary boundary between literary studies and critical race theory (a field within legal studies that examines systemic racism in the context of the law). One example of such an interdisciplinary intervention is to bring together Cheryl Harris, a critical race theorist, and Joyce Carol Oates, a novelist. Harris published one of the foundational pieces of critical race theory in 1993 with her law review article \\u201cWhiteness as Property,\\u201d a legal analysis of whiteness, and Oates produced a masterpiece of American literature in 1980 with her novel Bellefleur, a complex story of a powerful white family that spans seven generations. This pairing lays the groundwork for the type of interdisciplinary dialogue we need because, within literary studies, when the novelist is white and the characters are white, there is still very little emphasis on the study of whiteness even though race is a significant focus of attention when the novelist and characters are people of color. Whiteness is still invisible, and that is part of the problem I am describing, both within literary studies and in our society at large. We need an interdisciplinary intervention to pull back the curtain on whiteness, see how it operates, recognize its danger, and dismantle it. Bringing together Harris and Oates, specifically \\u201cWhiteness as Property\\u201d and Bellefleur, can help us do just that as we work towards achieving justice.\",\"published_in\":\"Bearing Witness: Joyce Carol Oates Studies, Vol 2 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Language and Literature; P; American literature; PS1-3576\",\"subject\":\"Language and Literature; P; American literature; \",\"authors\":\"Karen Gaffney\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15867\\/331917.2.3\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"0a5dc3de8d34a41dbb286b6808aad9a3e51b26ea2e64c256523430ab91e1d141\",\"relevance\":50,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15867\\/331917.2.3\"},{\"id\":\"e6462ff25c9c05d5d6094e5365f7d40c61c6dbb6be052bd971c5d1cc5dd9ffc4\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.library.ubc.ca\\/index.php\\/cjur\\/article\\/view\\/190018\\/188796; https:\\/\\/ojs.library.ubc.ca\\/index.php\\/cjur\\/article\\/view\\/190018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.library.ubc.ca\\/index.php\\/cjur\\/article\\/view\\/190018\",\"title\":\"Criminalization of Minority Youth in the Youth Justice System in Canada\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Despite the immeasurable amount of research completed on adult correctional facilities within North America, little is known about the overrepresentation of visible minority youth within the juvenile justice system. Through preliminary indications from this experimentation high delinquency due to cultural identity and socio-economic status has caused the federal offender population to become diverse. The face of the youth justice system within Canada is rapidly changing. Increasing forms of diversity serves as a principal pattern because the criminalization of minority youth occurs from cultural incompetence, unawareness, and insensitivity. This study recovers the institutional\\/systemic forms of treatment that minority youth face within the criminal justice system. It also further shows that there is no focus on the experiences of minority youth within juvenile correctional facilities due to a lack of information. The examination of criminalized practices, policies and methods of police organizations, correctional institutions and the court of law within Canada reveals institutional racism. Racial antagonism within the youth justice system leads to the criminalization of minority youth, which serves as a foundation for why culture shapes the identity of racialized youth.

For many Indigenous children and families, mainstream Australian society fails to provide the conditions for social growth because it is built on systemic racism. In order to create the conditions for positive social engagement for Indigenous children and families, there needs to be a social investment framework which recognises that colonisation has impacted negatively on Indigenous social and economic capacity, and which builds on the strengths of Indigenous culture and respects the self-determining rights of Indigenous communities in order to re-build capacity. A holistic, cultural strengthening and self-determination\\/human rights-based framework is the best approach to ensure that Indigenous children have a better future and participate positively in Australian society without forfeiting cultural identity and integrity. A human rights and culturally respectful framework can facilitate a \\u2018meeting place\\u2019 where Indigenous cultures can engage with the dominant culture and positive partnerships for social investment can be developed.\",\"published_in\":\"Children Australia ; volume 35, issue 2, page 6-11 ; ISSN 1035-0772 2049-7776\",\"year\":\"2010\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sociology and Political Science; Developmental and Educational Psychology; Health(social science)\",\"subject\":\"Sociology and Political Science; Developmental and Educational Psychology; Health(social science)\",\"authors\":\"Bamblett, Muriel; Lewis, Peter\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s1035077200000997\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f271f098531c7b0b08f2a872a1a75da4610664a146cf23a2d0a4b0944444b493\",\"relevance\":48,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s1035077200000997\"},{\"id\":\"e0b05a3c4757773ca9e59b9625cd62429b056492e75a0ef7bebbf4792cce9b2a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/sur.conectas.org\\/en\\/human-rights-and-the-non-human-black-body\\/; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1806-6445; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1983-3342; 1806-6445; 1983-3342; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b5927749b61b43eb8965fa9a78d821c2\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b5927749b61b43eb8965fa9a78d821c2\",\"title\":\"HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE NON-HUMAN BLACK BODY\",\"paper_abstract\":\"When a black student threw faeces at a statue of British imperialist Cecil John Rhodes at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, it sparked the formation of #RhodesMustFall, a black radical student movement that sought to address systemic racism at the white liberal university through its demand to decolonize the institution. #RhodesMustFall adopted a decolonial framework centred on Black Consciousness, Pan-Africanism and Black radical feminism, but simultaneously rejected human rights discourses embedded in South Africa\\u2019s progressive constitution. This paper examines the arguments developed by #RhodesMustFall in its rejection of human rights, including the idea that human rights is incapable of contemplating the non-human: an entity, often a black body, that takes on human characteristics but is not recognized as human.

This new movement for social justice developed from past struggles and during the aftermath of the 2012 murder of Trayvon Martin, 2014 Ferguson uprising, and 2020 George Floyd uprising.

Self-reflection has emerged through the teacher-as-researcher and the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner identities in professional development. However, this looking inward avoids looking at the larger social structures and the ways in which knowledge of the self is built on social constructions of knowledge and a privileged identity that marginalizes and oppresses Others.

This article examines the discourses of denial that feature in the talk of local anti-racism actors in Australia, and asks what drives these discourses. The research draws on qualitative interviews undertaken with participants involved in local anti-racism in two case study areas, one in South Australia and the other in New South Wales. This article explores the way local participants in the case study areas deployed four discourses to deny or minimise racism: temporal deflections; spatial deflections; deflections from the mainstream; and absence discourses. Place defending and the desire to protect one's local area from being branded a racist space is discussed as a driver of those local denial discourses. Local denial of racism is also linked to national politics of racism and anti-racism. In particular, the Australian government's retreat from multiculturalism, and the preference for 'harmony' rather than 'anti-racism' initiatives, was linked to the avoidance of the language of racism within participants' responses. The way denial discourses narrow the range of possibilities for local anti-racism is discussed, as is the importance of acknowledgement of racism, particularly institutional and systemic racism. Public acknowledgement of these forms of racism will broaden the scope of local anti-racism.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"XXXXXX - Unknown; anti-racism; Aboriginal Australians; Australia; denial; racism; discrimination; multiculturalism; reconciliation\",\"subject\":\"XXXXXX - Unknown; anti-racism; Aboriginal Australians; Australia; denial; racism; discrimination; multiculturalism; reconciliation\",\"authors\":\"Nelson, Jacqueline (R17218)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/handle.uws.edu.au:8081\\/1959.7\\/524326\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e67b32c270efe52915ee105c41f9669b948e4ae6944bb564ec66d577f880c15a\",\"relevance\":38,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e7e0d62e83f41ec174fbe7a6568da292417dad1376e40abe9f3b60f1fdac8e9e\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/edi-06-2020-0169; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/EDI-06-2020-0169\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/EDI-06-2020-0169\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"A death in the family: a metaphor about race and police brutality\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose This essay was written in response to the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks by police in 2020 and the surge of social justice protests they helped to reignite.

Without personal connections to Indigenous communities, many Canadians fail to grasp the depth of intergenerational impacts of residential schools and associated systemic racism. Consequently, reconciliation remains an elusive concept. Here we outline 10 Calls to Action to natural scientists to enable reconciliation in their work. We focus on natural scientists because a common connection to the land should tie the social license of natural scientists more closely to Indigenous communities than currently exists. We also focus on natural sciences because of the underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in this field. We draw on existing guidelines and our experiences in northern Canada. Our 10 Calls to Action are triggered by frustration. The authors have witnessed examples where natural scientists treat Indigenous communities with blatant disrespect or with ignorance of Indigenous rights. These 10 Calls to Action challenge the scientific community to recognize that reconciliation requires a new way of conducting natural science, one that includes and respects Indigenous communities, rights, and knowledge leading to better scientific and community outcomes.\",\"published_in\":\"FACETS ; volume 5, issue 1, page 769-783 ; ISSN 2371-1671\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wong, Carmen; Ballegooyen, Kate; Ignace, Lawrence; Johnson, Mary Jane (G\\u00f9dia); Swanson, Heidi\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1139\\/facets-2020-0005\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8fab193d1ac10ae58163a3840a69a3cf509a60453b66f6c64152d69820193194\",\"relevance\":36,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1139\\/facets-2020-0005\"},{\"id\":\"82b2b81db6fde5fb2aad81b2c29e00881897d1f819aeb0fe1cb00b8b90d010d4\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1550190620981033; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/1550190620981033; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/1550190620981033\",\"title\":\"These Stories Must Be Told: Preliminary Observations by a Black Scholar Practitioner on Silences in the Archive\",\"paper_abstract\":\"As a scholar practitioner, a trained philosophical theologian, Methodist clergywoman, and social enterprise founder who is conducting oral histories as part of my doctoral internship in the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute, my scholarly lens and methodological skills are being defined as I interrogate the COVID-19 archive.

Descriptive statistics and a Wilcoxon signed rank test determined differences between education and conception. Results: Results showed that students were less likely to perceive a neurotransmitter imbalance to cause mental illness, as opposed to what was emphasized during a formal medical education. Students and residents also understood the importance of factors such as systemic racism and socioeconomic status in the development of mental illness, which were factors that did not receive heavy emphasis during medical education. Furthermore, students and residents believed that not only did mental illnesses have nonuniform pathologies, but that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders also had the propensity to sometimes arbitrarily categorize individuals with potentially negative consequences.

To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 55-72 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Simultaneously, there has been a sevenfold increase in the prison population in the United States, in which African Americans are eight times more likely to be jailed than Whites (Western 2006, p. 3). In this paper, I draw on scholarship in history and sociology, as well as my own anthropological research, to develop the argument that criminal justice policies and immigration policies together disempower low-wage U.S. labor and maintain categorical racial inequalities in a \\u201cpostracial\\u201d United States. First, I review the historical role of race in U.S. immigration policy, and I consider the evidence for systemic racism in immigration enforcement in the contemporary period. Second, I discuss criminal legislation in the neoliberal era and examine the ways in which criminal legislation and immigration policies together disempower large segments of the U.S. workforce, satisfying employer demands for low cost and pliant labor. Finally, I argue that a political focus on immigrant workers' \\u201cillegality\\u201d masks the role of the state in (re)defining the legal status of low-wage workers and veils the ways in which punitive policies maintain historical racial and class inequalities.\",\"published_in\":\"Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race ; volume 9, issue 2, page 339-353 ; ISSN 1742-058X 1742-0598\",\"year\":\"2012\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Gomberg-Mu\\u00f1oz, Ruth\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s1742058x11000579\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"dd826f05f8439ecb4d67b5261046acdb31b630f472f39cd5d9b92b0cbf1b20ed\",\"relevance\":27,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s1742058x11000579\"},{\"id\":\"2826768d944c2212e5e4b105fb2394792463fe47727e67f52452c8ea8b75edba\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s1326011100004154; https:\\/\\/www.cambridge.org\\/core\\/services\\/aop-cambridge-core\\/content\\/view\\/S1326011100004154\",\"title\":\"Special Schooling for Indigenous Students: a New Form of Racial Discrimination?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Recent reports on Indigenous education have revealed that high proportions of students have been placed in special classes for intellectual disability or behaviour disorders. This is not an isolated phenomenon. Indigenous students in Canada and Romani children in Europe are also disproportionately represented in special schooling. This paper asks whether systemic racism, which fails to perceive cultural differences between the ethos of Australian educational systems and the experiences and abilities of Indigenous students, is the catalyst for placing many Indigenous students in special schooling, away from the mainstream. The paper applies an analysis based on anti-discrimination law to argue that while allocation on the basis of intellectual disability or behaviour disorders may not be deliberate racism, the criteria developed for the allocation may be measuring conformity to the dominant culture. If the policies underlying this segregation are unreasonable in the circumstances, they could constitute indirect racial discrimination against Indigenous students.

Owing to its roots in the environmental justice movement, addressing systemic racism is central to climate justice praxis in the United States, which is a necessary intervention in typically technocratic climate politics. What emerges from US climate justice is a moral appeal to \\u2018relationship\\u2019 as politics, the procedural demand that communities of color (the \\u2018frontline\\u2019) lead the movement, and a distributive claim on carbon pricing revenue. However, this praxis precludes a critique of racial capitalism, the process that relies on structural racism to enhance accumulation, alienating, exploiting, and immiserating black, brown, and white, while carrying out ecocide. The lack of an analysis of how class and race produce the crises climate justice confronts prevents the movement from demanding that global north fossil fuel abolition occur in tandem with the reassertion of the public over the private and de-growth. Drawing on research conducted primarily in Oregon and Washington, I argue that race works to both create and limit the transformative possibilities of climate politics.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Sciences, Vol 7, Iss 10, p 192 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"climate justice movement; carbon pricing; racial capitalism; de-growth; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"climate justice movement; carbon pricing; racial capitalism; de-growth; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Rachel Slocum\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/socsci7100192\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"3106dddcb4c5404f49406bef81c9de4739718a27531f23eb981f22f2ec1723fb\",\"relevance\":25,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/socsci7100192\"},{\"id\":\"bc00bd17773a1a51fbb79d056c48e3d8f694b74c9166c9e0eb9b8fe186bcf8a8\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1462474520976964; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/1462474520976964; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/1462474520976964\",\"title\":\"Desistance, persistence, resilience and resistance: A qualitative exploration of how Black fathers with criminal records navigate employer discrimination\",\"paper_abstract\":\"While research suggests a growing proclivity amongst contemporary fathers towards emotional involvement and child caregiving, studies indicate that most men still experience unrelenting pressure to provide financially for their family. For some fathers, the ability to spend time with their children is contingent on financial provision. Fathering, therefore, can be dependent on employment. The intersection of Blackness, maleness, and a criminal record, however, often results in employer discrimination, which hinders reentering Black men\\u2019s ability to secure legitimate revenue streams and achieve fathering expectations. In response to these barriers, many men agentically create opportunities for themselves in order to provide for their families. Framed using Sites of Resilience and Posttraumatic Growth, the current study draws from qualitative data and adds to the literature by focusing on the act of hurdling rather than the hurdles faced upon reentry. Findings demonstrate how hustling upon reentry is not a display of persistent criminal character but, rather, reflects a resilient response to systemic racism and blocked opportunities. The discussion on policy implications is led by participant suggestions on how to deter criminal activity while providing opportunities for men with criminal records to support their families.\",\"published_in\":\"Punishment & Society ; page 146247452097696 ; ISSN 1462-4745 1741-3095\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"authors\":\"Henson, Abigail\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1462474520976964\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"bc00bd17773a1a51fbb79d056c48e3d8f694b74c9166c9e0eb9b8fe186bcf8a8\",\"relevance\":24,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1462474520976964\"},{\"id\":\"26251806a7c7753005967559d8a1a9ce7026775140c7acaf29a19947c0028080\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/tidsskrift.dk\\/lev\\/article\\/view\\/112681\\/161436; https:\\/\\/tidsskrift.dk\\/lev\\/article\\/view\\/112681; doi:10.7146\\/lev.v0i4.112681\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/tidsskrift.dk\\/lev\\/article\\/view\\/112681; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7146\\/lev.v0i4.112681\",\"title\":\"Popular Science Articles and Academic Reports on the Topics of Cultural Commodification and Institutionalised Racism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper examines two aspects within cultural studies, namely that of cultural commodification and institutionalised racism.

Across the Americas, the hemispheric parallels undergirding collective resistance to anti-Black racism and state-sanctioned violence lend themselves to multifaceted interdisciplinary scholarly examinations. Using transnational anti-Black racism in Latin America as a point of departure, we advance a theorization of critical race theory in education capable of interrogating racist structures of coloniality, modernity, and White supremacy that operate globally to suppress Black humanity and humanness in general. To that extent, we draw from and reposition critical race theory (CRT) from its sociohistoric heritage in the United States and instead conceptualize transnational anti-Black racism vis-\\u00e0-vis a Black Diaspora reading of CRT. Finally, we return to education as a key site of contestation for transnational anti-Black racism and draw implications for the meaning of this global theorization of CRT in urban education, praxis, and educational research.

The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism.

This is justified by the requirement for universities to work towards monitoring and evaluating efforts to create non-discriminatory and inclusive training environments. Methods This study employed qualitative research methods. Ten Black African medical specialists were interviewed about their training experiences in two university training hospitals in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Interview data was collected using open-ended questions and coded and analysed using thematic and critical discursive analysis techniques. Results Four experiential themes emerged from the interview data, they included: 1) experiences of everyday racism during work hours, 2) the physical and psychological effects of tokenism and an increased need to perform, 3) institutional racism as a result of inconsistent and unclear methods of promotion and clinical competence building, and 4) an organisational culture that was experienced as having a race and gender bias. Conclusion This is a pilot study and there are limits on the generalizability of the data due to the small sample. What is clear from our participants, though, is the strong experiential component of finding it challenging to be a Black trainee in a White-dominated profession.

Bystander anti-racism is conceptualized as action taken by \\u201cordinary\\u201d people in response to incidents of interpersonal or systemic racism. The utility of bystander anti-racism is also demonstrated, with evidence suggesting productive effects for targets and bystanders, as well as perpetrators. The relative merits of confrontational or diplomatic action are reviewed, as is the delicate balance between communicating disapproval and maintaining interpersonal relations. The potential of bystander anti-racism will be enhanced where there are social norms that are intolerant of racism. The literature has paid little attention to the influence of context or to affective drivers of bystander anti-racism. We recommend changes to Ashburn-Nardo's five-stage Confronting Prejudice Model, to better facilitate anti-racism policy and practice. The additions adapt the model to organizational settings, and more strongly acknowledge the importance of social norms and contexts, as well as the specific functions of racism. Through these changes, there is a scope to increase the prominence of bystander anti-racism as a vital element of anti-racism policy.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2011\",\"subject_orig\":\"anti-racism; tolerance; racism; bystanders; interpersonal relations; social policy; -\",\"subject\":\"anti-racism; tolerance; racism; bystanders; interpersonal relations; social policy; -\",\"authors\":\"Nelson, Jacqueline; Dunn, Kevin M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/handle.uws.edu.au:8081\\/1959.7\\/509735\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"54ef5b3ca008dc80cf82b3d8e49fa028d908fb49fd923b63c47a7c302dedd808\",\"relevance\":16,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"3165d60a7090ae3dc11e8f0a56882e5d72fc8679d1e9bc56b42edc386fc46f26\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unisalento.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18562; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2421-2113; 2421-2113; doi:10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p55; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e9e161dce28847c3829f8a82393f9be3\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p55; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e9e161dce28847c3829f8a82393f9be3\",\"title\":\"\\u201cI believe in that movement and I believe in that chant\\u201d: The influence of Black Lives Matter on resilience and empowerment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Over the past few years, systemic racism has been increasingly in the news via the work of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 55-72 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Racism; Empowerment; Resilience; Black Lives Matter; Philosophy.

A long history of systemic racism has made these women extremely vulnerable to violent crimes. Most of their fates remain a mystery, but some murderers have been caught who are responsible for their deaths. I examined the news articles that cover the crimes of convicted murderers Robert Pickton and John Martin Crawford. Of the two, only Pickton is very well known. However, while the media covered his crimes extensively, much of the coverage is misleading. The aboriginality of the victims is downplayed, and other tactics are used to blame the victims and focus on the killer. The coverage surrounding John Martin Crawford uses similar misleading strategies, although there is significantly less of it. I argue that because the aboriginality of the victims was emphasized instead of downplayed in the coverage of Crawford\\u2019s murders, there was less interest in the cases. Most people will read about crimes when they can identify with the victims. While most of Pickton\\u2019s victims were aboriginal, the number of victims was so enormous and the details of the case were so grisly, that the aboriginality was downplayed to attract the attention that these other aspects gave the case. Crawford\\u2019s victims were all aboriginal women, but he killed fewer and was not seen as a threat. The media influences how people think about society. If the media continues to treat these types of crimes in this way, the ideas that fuel these crimes will also continue.\",\"published_in\":\"Inquiry@Queen's Undergraduate Research Conference Proceedings; 2013: 7th I@Q Conference Proceedings\",\"year\":\"2018-02-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Cameron, Anna\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.library.queensu.ca\\/index.php\\/inquiryatqueens\\/article\\/view\\/9288\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"15071b47a1b82279b3d82fae12aa7b45a65bdf23c5eb8e2c982c24dfaadae8a7\",\"relevance\":14,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"f46f76c6c1ba208cd113c98583b1766e3eb6ee5ff30af1779a505a37f0bd8a9e\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/hdl\\/11392\\/2413900; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11392\\/2413900\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11392\\/2413900\",\"title\":\"When ecological-crisis meets a stratified Earth.

The recent murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have prompted a national debate about the need to address systemic racism in policing within the United States. Recent studies have shown how racial resentment has spilled over into a wide range of political issues that are not associated with race; however, no current research examines how racial resentment might shape whites\\u2019 views toward Black Lives Matter. Employing the racial reaction theory and the 2016 American Election Study Survey, we hypothesize and confirm that whites with high levels of racial resentment, conservative ideology, and those who indicated support for Donald Trump hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement. Our results also show that Asians and Hispanics hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement, but that whites have the highest racial resentment levels. The results raise doubts about whether the recent shift in white public opinion is sustainable. Given that racial resentment is a predictor of support for Black Lives Matter, scholars and activists should approach white support for Black Lives Matter with caution because it is likely that increased racial resentment may lead to sustained white opposition to the movement.\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 4, page 496-515 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Riley, Emmitt Y.; Peterson, Clarissa\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.496\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8d49c339c9cdfbc307b6b905d222f240f4fe507f2ebd8cf98b5981a8c27301ab\",\"relevance\":11,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.496\"},{\"id\":\"a6e4cb93b88415370a8f29f33629b76eb1921be907ea36a7a7b9313fe4a3cc64\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2153368718760969; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/2153368718760969; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/2153368718760969\",\"title\":\"Sustaining Systemic Racism Through Psychological Gaslighting: Denials of Racial Profiling and Justifications of Carding by Police Utilizing Local News Media\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article examines Police Services and local media discourses on street checks in Hamilton, Ontario, from June 2015 to April 2016 and their usage as a form of psychological abuse known as gaslighting. Despite the widespread coverage that the Hamilton Police Service received as a result of being linked to systemic racist practices, a year later, the Hamilton Police Service was able to avoid being implicated in deliberately conducting racial profiling through strategic tactics in the discourse they relied upon and presented in the media. Through an analysis of 27 local news media articles on the topic of street checks, it is argued that the Police Services and local media discourse enact gaslighting, a form of psychological abuse that is used to manipulate object(s) in order to deceive and undermine the credibility of the target. The psychological effects of gaslighting on people of color included a sense of alienation, disenfranchisement from the community, and distrust toward the police. Through a case study application, it is suggested that gaslighting is part of a systemic, historical process of racism that has been used by the police and government organizations to both illegally target people of color and deny complicity in racial profiling.\",\"published_in\":\"Race and Justice ; volume 10, issue 4, page 424-455 ; ISSN 2153-3687 2153-3687\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Tobias, Heston; Joseph, Ameil\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2153368718760969\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"a6e4cb93b88415370a8f29f33629b76eb1921be907ea36a7a7b9313fe4a3cc64\",\"relevance\":10,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2153368718760969\"},{\"id\":\"f2b5a443604678506008b8dd3a887754d671c9d19abfef5c64991531b97c07a0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/sur.conectas.org\\/en\\/a-moral-budget-from-a-moral-movement\\/; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1806-6445; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1983-3342; 1806-6445; 1983-3342; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/fd244862d06f4323a0654bc9e4c9435e\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/fd244862d06f4323a0654bc9e4c9435e\",\"title\":\"A MORAL BUDGET FROM A MORAL MOVEMENT: The Poor People\\u2019s Campaign\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Poor People\\u2019s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival is a national campaign in the U.S. that has grown to more than 40 states across the country.

Though some critique disparities through a structural lens, others use deficit discourse, blaming families of color and working-class families for educational outcomes. This study examines how state policy insiders explain educational inequity, shedding light on the complex relationship between language and the maintenance of systemic racism and classism in education. Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity. These strategies allowed some policy insiders to strengthen deficit discourse, divert attention from structural issues, and characterize themselves positively while advancing racist and classist ideas. These findings have compelling implications in terms of possibilities for policy changes supportive of educational equity.\",\"published_in\":\"education policy analysis archives; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; archivos analiticos de politicas educativas; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; Arquivos Anal\\u00edticos de Pol\\u00edticas Educativas; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; 1068-2341\",\"year\":\"2015-09-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class\",\"subject\":\"policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class\",\"authors\":\"Bertrand, Melanie; Perez, Wendy Y.; Rogers, John\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/epaa.asu.edu\\/ojs\\/article\\/view\\/2068\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ee5a08d288a1fe131284b29707da56c29cbdcc1e1410e67e592de40ad2072b54\",\"relevance\":1,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"}]",

As the United States navigates a social awakening, primary care providers (PCPs) need to join the movement by addressing the impact of racism on our society.

The present Study 1 conceptually replicates these findings among Whites and Blacks attending the same racially diverse university. Consistent with previous findings, Whites (vs. Blacks) displayed less critical historical knowledge, explaining their greater denial of systemic racism. Moreover, stronger racial identity among Whites predicted greater systemic racism denial. A brief Study 2 intervention boosts Whites\\u2019 racism perceptions.

Indigenous peoples continue to be oppressed by racial discrimination enacted through legislation, policies and practices of the Canadian state, including the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). Systemic racism, practiced through institutionalized policies and customary behaviour affecting people working in organizations, results in inequality for some groups and privileges for others. Since 2002 the CAF has been covered by the federal Employment Equity Act whose purpose is to address systemic discrimination by requiring employers to remove and prevent systemic barriers to equality for Indigenous people, women and \\u201cvisible minorities\\u201d and to maintain a workforce that reflects the diversity of the Canadian population. Aside from its legal obligation, it is in the interest of the CAF to recruit and retain Indigenous People because they are an essential part of Canada\\u2019s labour supply. However Indigenous members of the CAF comprise a small and marginalized minority within a rigid, bureaucratic and culturally foreign organization.Implementing the Employment Equity Act could assist the CAF to address the Canadian state\\u2019s promise of reconciliation, fairness and equality for Indigenous people. This chapter reviews available evidence bearing on the CAF\\u2019s employment equity record, which presents a pattern of resistance to the Act\\u2019s requirements and failure to progress toward a representative workforce. In the absence of effective action to implement change, the CAF has yet to find a path from systemic racism toward employment equity for Indigenous People.

The ideal model for an unbiased homeless system would distribute assistance such that it is received in equal percentages across racial\\/ethnic groups as the percent of that racial group experiencing homelessness.

These suggest that poverty rates alone do not explain the over-representation, but that systemic racism blunts the ability of people of color to recover from financial catastrophe to avoid homelessness relative to those who are White. ; wny_racial_disparities_2018.pdf: 20 downloads, before Oct. 1, 2020. housing; neighborhoods; buffalo; poverty; inequality; homelessness  Homeless Alliance of Western New York\"},{\"id\":\"053512bfd4c3e9569b324a26ce97d820c1be3e02e2c7387d6a2a64b22b3b314f\",\"content\":\"Experiences of racism among urban Indigenous Australians: findings from the DRUID study Although Indigenous people continue to experience racism in contemporary Australian society, we know little about the nature of such experiences. The Measure of Indigenous Racism Experiences [MIRE] assesses racism across several dimensions in an urban Indigenous context. This paper presents findings from 312 Indigenous volunteers who responded to the MIRE as part of the Darwin Region Urban Indigenous Diabetes study. Interpersonal racism was reported by 70 per cent of participants, most commonly from service providers and in employment and public settings. A third of respondents had high levels of internalized racism while two-thirds acknowledged the existence of systemic racism. Interpersonal and systemic racism were most commonly reported among older respondents, those of higher socioeconomic position and among those who identified strongly with their culture. Further research is needed to understand the impact of racism on Indigenous people and to determine how to combat racism in Australian society.

Africana people have made strides at all levels of the American government. Africana people were a vital voting block that helped to elect the first American President of African descent. However, studies have shown that the conditions of Africana people in America have not substantially changed since the Voting Rights Act of 1 965 was enacted. Africana political participation has not equated to socioeconomic equality on a large scale for the Africana community. Utilizing Feagin's Systemic Racism Theory, this project looks to examine why solely relying upon the American political system is symptomatic of disagency for Africana people and argues that this dis-agency does not empower our people to seek solutions. It places the power to liberate in the oppressor's hands, thus maintaining the inequality that continues to exist in America. This article also argues for Africana people to look to themselves as the avenue for addressing the societal ills that it faces. It also argues that Africana people must be their own mechanism for liberation. In addition, the terms Africana and Black will be used interchangeably in the project because those terms are most readily identifiable to people of African descent living in America.

These statistics represent a clear disparity between whites and African Americans in the criminal justice system and give valid reason to be concerned about the effects of mass incarceration and the war on drugs on African American communities (Bobo and Johnson 2004). This paper will draw from conflict theory to argue that the methods employed to fight the war on drugs in America (whether purposefully or not) work to deplete social welfare of African American communities through the use of discriminatory rhetoric, increasingly harsh and racially targeted policies, and prejudicial enforcement and mobilization of these policies, which reinforce existing systems of control and domination in North American society. Possible strategies that may be implemented to remediate this issue include shifting focus from supply reduction strategies (which mainly function to punish offenders) to demand reduction strategies which aim to persuade people not to use or buy drugs, through education and drug abuse treatment (Tonry 1994:66), including integrated public health-public safety strategies (Marlowe 2003). war on drugs; racism; systemic racism; justice system; criminal justice system; mass incarceration; drug crime; drug crimes; policing; criminology The Sociological Imagination: Undergraduate Journal; Vol 6 No 1 (2020) Boghosian, Mileva\"},{\"id\":\"d5b04c690b1dd4a6a304a9d74cadea36e06ea4799450cb6df2465633046b0d48\",\"content\":\"How Levinas Can (and Cannot) Help Us with Political Apology in the Context of Systemic Racism What is the structure of an apology? What is an apology supposed to achieve, and how do we know when it has achieved its purpose? These questions seem pretty straightforward when we are speaking of an apology as it is traditionally conceived, which considers an explicit action that I have performed toward another individual. But how does one apologize for one\\u2019s thrownness into systemic structures of inequality and violence\\u2014such as America\\u2019s long history of racism toward people of color?

This essay will consider Emmanuel Levinas\\u2019s work and how it relates to this notion of a political apology. In some respects, Levinas\\u2019s thought is profoundly constructive and useful; however, his ahistorical, asymmetrical account of intersubjectivity is inadequate to explain what an apology seeks to achieve on a substantial political level. For this, I believe we must articulate a Levinasian-inspired account of the self\\u207bother relation that more adequately takes into account both parties as well as the concrete situation in which the need for apology arises.

Similar to large institutions, human service agencies may maintain racism due to established patterns of Eurocentricity. Agencies also function as entities where change can be affected. The following case study is about the process of decentering whiteness at a feminist health organisation located in an urban centre in the United States. The author, a white, non-binary woman, serving on the board of directors, offered to present a graduate paper at an agency-wide meeting. Preparations for this presentation evolved into a year-long process, during which time the agency began to grapple with the limitations of a cultural competence framework in its services for women\\u2019s and trans health.Feminist intersectionality theory is used to examine the organisation\\u2019s steps towards facing its Eurocentricity. This case study provides examples from organisational practice, during a year of racial turbulence, to explore three strategies that human service agencies commonly use to avoid confronting internal issues of race. It deconstructs past events in which staff maintained systemic racism through (1) disowning past harm, (2) suppression of criticism, and (3) deflection of responsibility through white feminine fragility.A narrative of events is analysed with the support of scholarship to explore how an intersectional approach can address gaps in the flawed implementation of a cultural competence framework. Intersectionality theory can transform ways of thinking among human service providers to promote critical analysis of racism within agency settings. This framework also shows the connection between systemic racism and the delegitimisation of individuals, an essential concept to the task of decentering whiteness within human service organisations.

Although racialized youth account for half of the youth population in Canadian cities like Toronto, their experience in public libraries is an unstudied area of Canadian LIS scholarly and professional research. Existing research approaches youth as a homogenous group in terms of age and biological stages and does not account for race, class, and urbanism. However, racialized youth face different challenges in which race and systemic racism are a facet of everyday life. This work aims to reverse racial neutrality in public libraries by demonstrating how ambivalence about race perpetuates systemic inequalities and the disengagement of racialized youth. It draws on interdisciplinary research to show how the race-blind approach is not reflective of the needs of communities being served. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, it shows that public libraries can implement processes to gather race-specific data under the recently-implemented Anti-Racism Act (2017). This will provide a contextual understanding of the racial make-up of users and provide a valuable frame of reference to support efforts to build stronger and more effective relationships.

Clinicians, restaurant cooks, cashiers, transit operators, and other essential workers (EWs), however, continued to work outside the home during this time in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society. In the United States, EWs are often low-income persons of color who are more likely to face socioeconomic vulnerabilities, systemic racism, and health inequities. To assess the various impacts of COVID-19 on EWs, an online survey was distributed to a representative sample of individuals residing in six states during May\\/June 2020. The sample included 990 individuals who identified as EWs and 736 nonessential workers (NWs). We assessed differences between EW and NW respondents according to three categories related to health equity and social determinants of health: (1) demographics (e.g. race\\/ethnicity); (2) COVID-19 exposure risk pathways (e.g. ability to social distance); and (3) COVID-19 risk perceptions (e.g. perceived risk of contracting COVID-19). EWs were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than NWs and also had lower incomes and education levels on average. Unsurprisingly, EWs were substantially more likely to report working outside the home and less likely to report social distancing and wearing masks indoors as compared to NWs. EWs also perceived a slightly greater risk of contracting COVID-19. These findings, which we discuss in the context of persistent structural inequalities, systemic racism, and health inequities within the United States, highlight ways in which COVID-19 exacerbates existing socioeconomic vulnerabilities faced by EWs.

Next, it explores the origin of this paradox \\u2013 how it is that ostensibly antiracist intentions are transmuted into \\u2018benevolently racist\\u2019 actions. Finally, it presents an alternative approach to mitigating racialized inequality, one which more effectively challenges the self-oriented and extractive logics undergirding systemic racism: rather than expropriating blame to others, or else adopting introspective and psychologized approaches to fundamentally social problems, those sincerely committed to antiracism can take concrete steps in the real world \\u2013 actions which require no legislation or coercion of naysayers, just a willingness to personally make sacrifices for the sake of racial justice.

The play opened to divergent audience reactions in East Jerusalem, igniting controversy, and leading to the expression of opinions that ranged from absolute support to clear opposition. This article discusses the play's intervention into an orientalist rhetorical context, showing how reversing traditional orientalist ventriloquisms can be employed as a key strategy of cultural resistance. An analysis of the production's choices and the critical responses it generated suggests that by consciously representing Jewish characters who struggle with their own religious and national identities through Palestinian performers, the play opens up the possibility of breaking the perception of balance between the occupier and the occupied. Extended to a larger context, a resistant ventriloquism can reveal systemic oppression, rendering injustices visible in cases where systemic racism prevents the colonizer from seeing the condition of the colonized.

Racial Discourse and Racial Politics One central area of dispute in current racial politics is whether an act, policy, or event constitutes racism.

I also explore how the dynamic nature of racial discourse leads to the emergence of new ways of defining racism as advocates seek advantages in political debate. Finally, I connect the struggle involving racism as a contested concept to two larger racial ideologies: color-blindness and systemic racism.

Our purpose was to explore the booktalking experience as a means of developing preservice librarians' understanding of culturally relevant pedagogy, a stance concerned with developing cultural competence and critical consciousness.

In response, Indigenous and Black women have been building grassroots social and environmental justice movements for decades to challenge the legal, political, and corporate agendas that sanction and enable environmental violence in their communities.

This question has confounded social researchers and educators who often limit definitions to population data. H. Richard Milner suggested a framework for defining urban schools that includes population data as well as the racial and social context of schools. This article applied Milner\\u2019s model to school districts in New York, Nebraska, and New Mexico which exemplified Milner\\u2019s categories of urban schools: urban intensive, urban emergent, and urban characteristic. Application of the framework to the districts presents a model for teacher educators to deliver two important components of preservice preparation. First, the model can assist preservice teachers to challenge their existing perceptions of urban schools. Second, establishing a framework provides teacher educators the opportunity to guide preservice teachers to view urban schools through a Critical Race Theory lens. Through this lens, preservice teachers can begin to realize the impact of systemic racism within education.

Psychology tells us that shoplifting is a mental deficiency manifested in women as \\u201ckleptomania\\u201d (Abelson 4). Given the subsequent international growth of shoplifting, we argue instead that shoplifting is in many ways condoned in contemporary culture: used as a form of social and political control in a late capitalist society. This article first turns to female consumers as shoplifters in the late nineteenth century, alongside the growth of mass production, large-scale department stores, and visually spectacular forms of display. In line with feminist critiques of Marx\\u2019s Capital, we uphold the conditions prescribed to women under capitalism and extend this argument to newer forms of systemic racism in the consumer sphere, which ensure that women of colour and of lower economic standing face even greater obstacles to success. Using a broad historical view, we analyze the act of shoplifting in two forms of cultural media, both set in Paris. The first is \\u00c9mile Zola\\u2019s novel The Ladies\\u2019 Paradise (1883), based on Paris\\u2019s first department store, Le Bon March\\u00e9. Due to Zola\\u2019s commitment to verisimilitude, we argue, his work offers the strongest corroboration of the ways in which new forms of visual display and a new class of psychologically-entitled females worked together to generate astounding accounts of theft. Our analysis then turns to a work of cinema produced nearly a century and a half later, C\\u00e9line Sciamma\\u2019s 2014 Girlhood. Sciamma portrays a group of young French African girls who navigate their paths into adulthood from the vantage of Bagnolet, a lower income immigrant suburb over four kilometers from Paris\\u2019s city centre. The girls experience racial profiling and demonstrate varying forms of resistance, one of them shoplifting. While shoplifting then appears to be an enduring weapon of the weak and strategy of resistance by the dispossessed, leading to, not surprisingly, tacitly permissibility for white middle class women and harsher consequences for women of colour, we conclude that the activity is leveraged to perpetuate pre-existent forms of gendered social control and cultural stereotyping. shoplifting; shopping; consumer culture; deviance; resistance; race; gender; Visual arts; N1-9211 Fashion Studies, Vol 2, Iss 1, Pp 1-39 (2019) Evangeline Holtz Schramek; Carolyn L.

Furthermore, we need to understand and reveal how whiteness has been socially constructed because the power of whiteness lies in its invisibility, and that fuels the perpetuation of systemic racism. In making whiteness visible, we can see how it has been wielded as a weapon, which in turn will allow us to see how destructive it is for everyone, whites included. As part of this work, we need to break down the disciplinary boundary between literary studies and critical race theory (a field within legal studies that examines systemic racism in the context of the law). One example of such an interdisciplinary intervention is to bring together Cheryl Harris, a critical race theorist, and Joyce Carol Oates, a novelist. Harris published one of the foundational pieces of critical race theory in 1993 with her law review article \\u201cWhiteness as Property,\\u201d a legal analysis of whiteness, and Oates produced a masterpiece of American literature in 1980 with her novel Bellefleur, a complex story of a powerful white family that spans seven generations. This pairing lays the groundwork for the type of interdisciplinary dialogue we need because, within literary studies, when the novelist is white and the characters are white, there is still very little emphasis on the study of whiteness even though race is a significant focus of attention when the novelist and characters are people of color. Whiteness is still invisible, and that is part of the problem I am describing, both within literary studies and in our society at large. We need an interdisciplinary intervention to pull back the curtain on whiteness, see how it operates, recognize its danger, and dismantle it. Bringing together Harris and Oates, specifically \\u201cWhiteness as Property\\u201d and Bellefleur, can help us do just that as we work towards achieving justice.

Through preliminary indications from this experimentation high delinquency due to cultural identity and socio-economic status has caused the federal offender population to become diverse. The face of the youth justice system within Canada is rapidly changing. Increasing forms of diversity serves as a principal pattern because the criminalization of minority youth occurs from cultural incompetence, unawareness, and insensitivity. This study recovers the institutional\\/systemic forms of treatment that minority youth face within the criminal justice system. It also further shows that there is no focus on the experiences of minority youth within juvenile correctional facilities due to a lack of information. The examination of criminalized practices, policies and methods of police organizations, correctional institutions and the court of law within Canada reveals institutional racism. Racial antagonism within the youth justice system leads to the criminalization of minority youth, which serves as a foundation for why culture shapes the identity of racialized youth.

For many Indigenous children and families, mainstream Australian society fails to provide the conditions for social growth because it is built on systemic racism. In order to create the conditions for positive social engagement for Indigenous children and families, there needs to be a social investment framework which recognises that colonisation has impacted negatively on Indigenous social and economic capacity, and which builds on the strengths of Indigenous culture and respects the self-determining rights of Indigenous communities in order to re-build capacity.

Self-reflection has emerged through the teacher-as-researcher and the teacher-as-reflective-practitioner identities in professional development. However, this looking inward avoids looking at the larger social structures and the ways in which knowledge of the self is built on social constructions of knowledge and a privileged identity that marginalizes and oppresses Others. I argue that this distraction on\\/from the self creates a meritocracy in professional development.

This article examines the discourses of denial that feature in the talk of local anti-racism actors in Australia, and asks what drives these discourses. The research draws on qualitative interviews undertaken with participants involved in local anti-racism in two case study areas, one in South Australia and the other in New South Wales. This article explores the way local participants in the case study areas deployed four discourses to deny or minimise racism: temporal deflections; spatial deflections; deflections from the mainstream; and absence discourses. Place defending and the desire to protect one's local area from being branded a racist space is discussed as a driver of those local denial discourses. Local denial of racism is also linked to national politics of racism and anti-racism. In particular, the Australian government's retreat from multiculturalism, and the preference for 'harmony' rather than 'anti-racism' initiatives, was linked to the avoidance of the language of racism within participants' responses. The way denial discourses narrow the range of possibilities for local anti-racism is discussed, as is the importance of acknowledgement of racism, particularly institutional and systemic racism. Public acknowledgement of these forms of racism will broaden the scope of local anti-racism.

We focus on natural scientists because a common connection to the land should tie the social license of natural scientists more closely to Indigenous communities than currently exists. We also focus on natural sciences because of the underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in this field. We draw on existing guidelines and our experiences in northern Canada. Our 10 Calls to Action are triggered by frustration. The authors have witnessed examples where natural scientists treat Indigenous communities with blatant disrespect or with ignorance of Indigenous rights. These 10 Calls to Action challenge the scientific community to recognize that reconciliation requires a new way of conducting natural science, one that includes and respects Indigenous communities, rights, and knowledge leading to better scientific and community outcomes.

In this article I attempt to offer some preliminary reflections on my oral history curation focused on how Black and brown artists and activists, primarily based in Indianapolis, IN, frame their lived experiences of death, dying, mourning, and bereavement in the wake of COVID-19 utilizing critical archival practices: those practices that take seriously the methods of critical race theory, critical gender theory, Womanist, mujerista, and feminist methodologies, to name a few. The COVID-19 archive is a collection of oral histories, stories and artifacts depicting the times in which we are living, through the lenses of storytellers grappling with the pandemics of systemic racism, COVID-19, distrust in government, and various relics representing the idea of the United States of America in 2020, as such, I conclude with a brief exploration of how art emerges as both an outlet for creators and a mode of illumination for consumers.

Discrepancies Between Medical Education and Conception Objective: This preliminary study examined the differences between what was taught during a formal medical education and medical students\\u2019 and psychiatry residents\\u2019 conceptions of notions regarding the causes and determinants of mental illness. Methods: The authors surveyed 74 medical students and 11 residents via convenience sampling. The survey contained 18 statements which were rated twice based on truthfulness in terms of a participant\\u2019s formal education and conception, respectively. Descriptive statistics and a Wilcoxon signed rank test determined differences between education and conception. Results: Results showed that students were less likely to perceive a neurotransmitter imbalance to cause mental illness, as opposed to what was emphasized during a formal medical education. Students and residents also understood the importance of factors such as systemic racism and socioeconomic status in the development of mental illness, which were factors that did not receive heavy emphasis during medical education. Furthermore, students and residents believed that not only did mental illnesses have nonuniform pathologies, but that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders also had the propensity to sometimes arbitrarily categorize individuals with potentially negative consequences. Conclusions: If these notions are therefore part of students\\u2019 and residents\\u2019 conceptions, as well as documented in the literature, then it seems appropriate for medical education to be further developed to emphasize these ideas.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

First, it argues that communities of opportunity should be developed to minimize some of the adverse impacts of systemic racism. These are communities that provide early childhood development resources, implement policies to reduce childhood poverty, provide work and income support opportunities for adults, and ensure healthy housing and neighborhood conditions. Second, the healthcare system needs new emphases on ensuring access to high quality care for all, strengthening preventive health care approaches, addressing patients\\u2019 social needs as part of healthcare delivery, and diversifying the healthcare work force to more closely reflect the demographic composition of the patient population. Finally, new research is needed to identify the optimal strategies to build political will and support to address social inequities in health. This will include initiatives to raise awareness levels of the pervasiveness of inequities in health, build empathy and support for addressing inequities, enhance the capacity of individuals and communities to actively participate in intervention efforts and implement large scale efforts to reduce racial prejudice, ideologies, and stereotypes in the larger culture that undergird policy preferences that initiate and sustain inequities. race; racism; ethnicity; inequities; disparities; interventions; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 16, Iss 4, p 606 (2019) David R.

Simultaneously, there has been a sevenfold increase in the prison population in the United States, in which African Americans are eight times more likely to be jailed than Whites (Western 2006, p. 3). In this paper, I draw on scholarship in history and sociology, as well as my own anthropological research, to develop the argument that criminal justice policies and immigration policies together disempower low-wage U.S. labor and maintain categorical racial inequalities in a \\u201cpostracial\\u201d United States. First, I review the historical role of race in U.S. immigration policy, and I consider the evidence for systemic racism in immigration enforcement in the contemporary period. Second, I discuss criminal legislation in the neoliberal era and examine the ways in which criminal legislation and immigration policies together disempower large segments of the U.S. workforce, satisfying employer demands for low cost and pliant labor. Finally, I argue that a political focus on immigrant workers' \\u201cillegality\\u201d masks the role of the state in (re)defining the legal status of low-wage workers and veils the ways in which punitive policies maintain historical racial and class inequalities.

Abstract Recent reports on Indigenous education have revealed that high proportions of students have been placed in special classes for intellectual disability or behaviour disorders. This is not an isolated phenomenon. Indigenous students in Canada and Romani children in Europe are also disproportionately represented in special schooling. This paper asks whether systemic racism, which fails to perceive cultural differences between the ethos of Australian educational systems and the experiences and abilities of Indigenous students, is the catalyst for placing many Indigenous students in special schooling, away from the mainstream. The paper applies an analysis based on anti-discrimination law to argue that while allocation on the basis of intellectual disability or behaviour disorders may not be deliberate racism, the criteria developed for the allocation may be measuring conformity to the dominant culture. If the policies underlying this segregation are unreasonable in the circumstances, they could constitute indirect racial discrimination against Indigenous students.

Owing to its roots in the environmental justice movement, addressing systemic racism is central to climate justice praxis in the United States, which is a necessary intervention in typically technocratic climate politics. What emerges from US climate justice is a moral appeal to \\u2018relationship\\u2019 as politics, the procedural demand that communities of color (the \\u2018frontline\\u2019) lead the movement, and a distributive claim on carbon pricing revenue. However, this praxis precludes a critique of racial capitalism, the process that relies on structural racism to enhance accumulation, alienating, exploiting, and immiserating black, brown, and white, while carrying out ecocide. The lack of an analysis of how class and race produce the crises climate justice confronts prevents the movement from demanding that global north fossil fuel abolition occur in tandem with the reassertion of the public over the private and de-growth.

For some fathers, the ability to spend time with their children is contingent on financial provision. Fathering, therefore, can be dependent on employment. The intersection of Blackness, maleness, and a criminal record, however, often results in employer discrimination, which hinders reentering Black men\\u2019s ability to secure legitimate revenue streams and achieve fathering expectations. In response to these barriers, many men agentically create opportunities for themselves in order to provide for their families. Framed using Sites of Resilience and Posttraumatic Growth, the current study draws from qualitative data and adds to the literature by focusing on the act of hurdling rather than the hurdles faced upon reentry. Findings demonstrate how hustling upon reentry is not a display of persistent criminal character but, rather, reflects a resilient response to systemic racism and blocked opportunities. The discussion on policy implications is led by participant suggestions on how to deter criminal activity while providing opportunities for men with criminal records to support their families.

Across the Americas, the hemispheric parallels undergirding collective resistance to anti-Black racism and state-sanctioned violence lend themselves to multifaceted interdisciplinary scholarly examinations. Using transnational anti-Black racism in Latin America as a point of departure, we advance a theorization of critical race theory in education capable of interrogating racist structures of coloniality, modernity, and White supremacy that operate globally to suppress Black humanity and humanness in general. To that extent, we draw from and reposition critical race theory (CRT) from its sociohistoric heritage in the United States and instead conceptualize transnational anti-Black racism vis-\\u00e0-vis a Black Diaspora reading of CRT. Finally, we return to education as a key site of contestation for transnational anti-Black racism and draw implications for the meaning of this global theorization of CRT in urban education, praxis, and educational research. We end by charting new and old directions for CRT in educational research.

These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism.

This is justified by the requirement for universities to work towards monitoring and evaluating efforts to create non-discriminatory and inclusive training environments. Methods This study employed qualitative research methods. Ten Black African medical specialists were interviewed about their training experiences in two university training hospitals in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Interview data was collected using open-ended questions and coded and analysed using thematic and critical discursive analysis techniques. Results Four experiential themes emerged from the interview data, they included: 1) experiences of everyday racism during work hours, 2) the physical and psychological effects of tokenism and an increased need to perform, 3) institutional racism as a result of inconsistent and unclear methods of promotion and clinical competence building, and 4) an organisational culture that was experienced as having a race and gender bias. Conclusion This is a pilot study and there are limits on the generalizability of the data due to the small sample. What is clear from our participants, though, is the strong experiential component of finding it challenging to be a Black trainee in a White-dominated profession. We are undertaking further research to explore the issues raised in more detail.

An analysis of media coverage of the Tamworth Council Sudanese Refugees Resettlement Case (2006) This article presents our analysis of Australian media reporting of the 2006 Tamworth City Council's decision to refuse the resettlement of five Sudanese families in Tamworth (NSW) and subsequent reversal, supposedly due to the pressure brought to bear on the council as a result of the media 'hype.' The question at the core of our analyses is as follows: Did the media play a role in the over-(re)presentation of this case as racist or was it just a case of the media reporting racism? Informed by media framing theory, we examine print media reports for patterns of presentation as well as representations of both the council and the refugees who were the focus of the reporting. We conclude that while the media played a significant role in making visible a case built on racial stereotypes, their reporting also contained racializing and paternalistic stereotyping that contribute to the reproduction of both everyday and systemic racism.

This article is based on a research project conducted in Toronto, Ontario that implemented Aboriginal research methodologies to explore ways to increase collaboration between Aboriginal families, treatment counsellors, and child welfare workers. One significant theme that emerged out of this project was the concept of time as related to policy and legislation that negatively impact Aboriginal pregnant and\\/or parenting women. In this analysis, we focus on the concept of time as connected to four policy areas that emerged from the findings: historical trauma caused by discriminatory legislation, the family court system, the bureaucracy of child welfare, and the need for further research and long-term solutions.

Bystander anti-racism is conceptualized as action taken by \\u201cordinary\\u201d people in response to incidents of interpersonal or systemic racism. The utility of bystander anti-racism is also demonstrated, with evidence suggesting productive effects for targets and bystanders, as well as perpetrators. The relative merits of confrontational or diplomatic action are reviewed, as is the delicate balance between communicating disapproval and maintaining interpersonal relations. The potential of bystander anti-racism will be enhanced where there are social norms that are intolerant of racism. The literature has paid little attention to the influence of context or to affective drivers of bystander anti-racism. We recommend changes to Ashburn-Nardo's five-stage Confronting Prejudice Model, to better facilitate anti-racism policy and practice. The additions adapt the model to organizational settings, and more strongly acknowledge the importance of social norms and contexts, as well as the specific functions of racism. Through these changes, there is a scope to increase the prominence of bystander anti-racism as a vital element of anti-racism policy. anti-racism; tolerance; racism; bystanders; interpersonal relations; social policy; -  Nelson, Jacqueline; Dunn, Kevin M.\"},{\"id\":\"3165d60a7090ae3dc11e8f0a56882e5d72fc8679d1e9bc56b42edc386fc46f26\",\"content\":\"\\u201cI believe in that movement and I believe in that chant\\u201d: The influence of Black Lives Matter on resilience and empowerment Over the past few years, systemic racism has been increasingly in the news via the work of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

A long history of systemic racism has made these women extremely vulnerable to violent crimes. Most of their fates remain a mystery, but some murderers have been caught who are responsible for their deaths. I examined the news articles that cover the crimes of convicted murderers Robert Pickton and John Martin Crawford. Of the two, only Pickton is very well known. However, while the media covered his crimes extensively, much of the coverage is misleading. The aboriginality of the victims is downplayed, and other tactics are used to blame the victims and focus on the killer. The coverage surrounding John Martin Crawford uses similar misleading strategies, although there is significantly less of it. I argue that because the aboriginality of the victims was emphasized instead of downplayed in the coverage of Crawford\\u2019s murders, there was less interest in the cases. Most people will read about crimes when they can identify with the victims. While most of Pickton\\u2019s victims were aboriginal, the number of victims was so enormous and the details of the case were so grisly, that the aboriginality was downplayed to attract the attention that these other aspects gave the case. Crawford\\u2019s victims were all aboriginal women, but he killed fewer and was not seen as a threat. The media influences how people think about society. If the media continues to treat these types of crimes in this way, the ideas that fuel these crimes will also continue.

The recent murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have prompted a national debate about the need to address systemic racism in policing within the United States. Recent studies have shown how racial resentment has spilled over into a wide range of political issues that are not associated with race; however, no current research examines how racial resentment might shape whites\\u2019 views toward Black Lives Matter. Employing the racial reaction theory and the 2016 American Election Study Survey, we hypothesize and confirm that whites with high levels of racial resentment, conservative ideology, and those who indicated support for Donald Trump hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement. Our results also show that Asians and Hispanics hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement, but that whites have the highest racial resentment levels. The results raise doubts about whether the recent shift in white public opinion is sustainable. Given that racial resentment is a predictor of support for Black Lives Matter, scholars and activists should approach white support for Black Lives Matter with caution because it is likely that increased racial resentment may lead to sustained white opposition to the movement.

Despite the widespread coverage that the Hamilton Police Service received as a result of being linked to systemic racist practices, a year later, the Hamilton Police Service was able to avoid being implicated in deliberately conducting racial profiling through strategic tactics in the discourse they relied upon and presented in the media. Through an analysis of 27 local news media articles on the topic of street checks, it is argued that the Police Services and local media discourse enact gaslighting, a form of psychological abuse that is used to manipulate object(s) in order to deceive and undermine the credibility of the target. The psychological effects of gaslighting on people of color included a sense of alienation, disenfranchisement from the community, and distrust toward the police. Through a case study application, it is suggested that gaslighting is part of a systemic, historical process of racism that has been used by the police and government organizations to both illegally target people of color and deny complicity in racial profiling.

While the COVID-19 global pandemic has intensified the pertinence of the course\\u2019s content, recent discourse on systemic racism and police brutality in the United States has also drawn renewed attention to the lack of inclusivity and accessibility within anthropological academia. Thus, with the design of this syllabus, we sought to decolonize our course content and pedagogy as a means of contributing to ongoing efforts towards inclusivity in academia. Our approach to a decolonized and inclusive syllabus included diversifying course content as well as constructing accessible language, assignments, and course policies. The following commentary outlines our goals for this endeavor and describes the process of creating this course. We detail our experiences with employing a decolonizing framework and present a guide for reading our completed syllabus so that we may encourage the development of more spaces where students can engage with and understand the benefits of decolonized scholarship. pandemics; pedagogy; online learning; decolonizing Teaching and Learning Anthropology, vol 3, iss 2 Primiano, Samantha J; Krishnan, Ananya; Sangaramoorthy, Thurka\"},{\"id\":\"ee5a08d288a1fe131284b29707da56c29cbdcc1e1410e67e592de40ad2072b54\",\"content\":\"The covert mechanisms of education policy discourse: Unmasking policy insiders\\u2019 discourses and discursive strategies in upholding or challenging racism and classism in education Policy insiders across party lines increasingly acknowledge educational \\u201cgaps,\\u201d yet they talk about this inequity in very different ways. Though some critique disparities through a structural lens, others use deficit discourse, blaming families of color and working-class families for educational outcomes. This study examines how state policy insiders explain educational inequity, shedding light on the complex relationship between language and the maintenance of systemic racism and classism in education. Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity. These strategies allowed some policy insiders to strengthen deficit discourse, divert attention from structural issues, and characterize themselves positively while advancing racist and classist ideas. These findings have compelling implications in terms of possibilities for policy changes supportive of educational equity. policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class education policy analysis archives; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; archivos analiticos de politicas educativas; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; Arquivos Anal\\u00edticos de Pol\\u00edticas Educativas; Vol 23 (2015); 93 ; 1068-2341 Bertrand, Melanie; Perez, Wendy Y.; Rogers, John\"}]"
