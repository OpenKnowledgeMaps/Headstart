A third of respondents had high levels of internalized racism while two-thirds acknowledged the existence of systemic racism.

Although racialized youth account for half of the youth population in Canadian cities like Toronto, their experience in public libraries is an unstudied area of Canadian LIS scholarly and professional research. Existing research approaches youth as a homogenous group in terms of age and biological stages and does not account for race, class, and urbanism. However, racialized youth face different challenges in which race and systemic racism are a facet of everyday life. This work aims to reverse racial neutrality in public libraries by demonstrating how ambivalence about race perpetuates systemic inequalities and the disengagement of racialized youth. It draws on interdisciplinary research to show how the race-blind approach is not reflective of the needs of communities being served. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, it shows that public libraries can implement processes to gather race-specific data under the recently-implemented Anti-Racism Act (2017). This will provide a contextual understanding of the racial make-up of users and provide a valuable frame of reference to support efforts to build stronger and more effective relationships.\",\"published_in\":\"Partnership: The Canadian Journal of Library and Information Practice and Research, Vol 15, Iss 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Public Libraries; Racialized Youth; Critical Race Theory; Anti-Racism; Bibliography.

Similar to large institutions, human service agencies may maintain racism due to established patterns of Eurocentricity. Agencies also function as entities where change can be affected. The following case study is about the process of decentering whiteness at a feminist health organisation located in an urban centre in the United States. The author, a white, non-binary woman, serving on the board of directors, offered to present a graduate paper at an agency-wide meeting. Preparations for this presentation evolved into a year-long process, during which time the agency began to grapple with the limitations of a cultural competence framework in its services for women\\u2019s and trans health.Feminist intersectionality theory is used to examine the organisation\\u2019s steps towards facing its Eurocentricity. This case study provides examples from organisational practice, during a year of racial turbulence, to explore three strategies that human service agencies commonly use to avoid confronting internal issues of race. It deconstructs past events in which staff maintained systemic racism through (1) disowning past harm, (2) suppression of criticism, and (3) deflection of responsibility through white feminine fragility.A narrative of events is analysed with the support of scholarship to explore how an intersectional approach can address gaps in the flawed implementation of a cultural competence framework. Intersectionality theory can transform ways of thinking among human service providers to promote critical analysis of racism within agency settings. This framework also shows the connection between systemic racism and the delegitimisation of individuals, an essential concept to the task of decentering whiteness within human service organisations.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Work & Policy Studies: Social Justice, Practice and Theory; Vol 3, No 1 (2020): Beyond \\\"Cultural Competency\\\": Confronting Whiteness in Social Work ; 2209-0878\",\"year\":\"2020-05-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Miller, Berg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au\\/index.php\\/SWPS\\/article\\/view\\/14287\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d69d9d60b745a94509fb8da91a33d0c0f64311e54e676f447742e09d9a5bdc92\",\"relevance\":102},{\"id\":\"2278a3c61e0a8b324bb958f35ac28a887e926e9f44f6b069c84d0b5c4f0eedf7\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/refuge.journals.yorku.ca\\/index.php\\/refuge\\/article\\/view\\/21237\\/19908; https:\\/\\/refuge.journals.yorku.ca\\/index.php\\/refuge\\/article\\/view\\/21237; doi:10.25071\\/1920-7336.21237\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/refuge.journals.yorku.ca\\/index.php\\/refuge\\/article\\/view\\/21237; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25071\\/1920-7336.21237\",\"title\":\"Systemic Racism: Refugee, Resettlement, and Education Policy in New Zealand\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Public policy in New Zealand increasingly makes reference to \\u201cinclusion of diversity,\\u201d \\u201cequality,\\u201d and \\u201cequity.\\u201d Yet refugees resettling in New Zealand continue to experience systemic racism based on the application of ostensibly neutral rules and universal standards to unequal situations.

The play opened to divergent audience reactions in East Jerusalem, igniting controversy, and leading to the expression of opinions that ranged from absolute support to clear opposition. This article discusses the play's intervention into an orientalist rhetorical context, showing how reversing traditional orientalist ventriloquisms can be employed as a key strategy of cultural resistance. An analysis of the production's choices and the critical responses it generated suggests that by consciously representing Jewish characters who struggle with their own religious and national identities through Palestinian performers, the play opens up the possibility of breaking the perception of balance between the occupier and the occupied.

Furthermore, we need to understand and reveal how whiteness has been socially constructed because the power of whiteness lies in its invisibility, and that fuels the perpetuation of systemic racism. In making whiteness visible, we can see how it has been wielded as a weapon, which in turn will allow us to see how destructive it is for everyone, whites included. As part of this work, we need to break down the disciplinary boundary between literary studies and critical race theory (a field within legal studies that examines systemic racism in the context of the law). One example of such an interdisciplinary intervention is to bring together Cheryl Harris, a critical race theorist, and Joyce Carol Oates, a novelist. Harris published one of the foundational pieces of critical race theory in 1993 with her law review article \\u201cWhiteness as Property,\\u201d a legal analysis of whiteness, and Oates produced a masterpiece of American literature in 1980 with her novel Bellefleur, a complex story of a powerful white family that spans seven generations. This pairing lays the groundwork for the type of interdisciplinary dialogue we need because, within literary studies, when the novelist is white and the characters are white, there is still very little emphasis on the study of whiteness even though race is a significant focus of attention when the novelist and characters are people of color. Whiteness is still invisible, and that is part of the problem I am describing, both within literary studies and in our society at large. We need an interdisciplinary intervention to pull back the curtain on whiteness, see how it operates, recognize its danger, and dismantle it. Bringing together Harris and Oates, specifically \\u201cWhiteness as Property\\u201d and Bellefleur, can help us do just that as we work towards achieving justice.\",\"published_in\":\"Bearing Witness: Joyce Carol Oates Studies, Vol 2 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Language and Literature; P; American literature; PS1-3576\",\"subject\":\"Language and Literature; P; American literature; \",\"authors\":\"Karen Gaffney\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15867\\/331917.2.3\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"0a5dc3de8d34a41dbb286b6808aad9a3e51b26ea2e64c256523430ab91e1d141\",\"relevance\":80},{\"id\":\"7287211f74afa2c8007adb92f246a23d5aeb0b5444a0b95d642150257bbf218b\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\/article\\/view\\/14540\\/Thurber; https:\\/\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\/article\\/view\\/14540\\/12700\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\/article\\/view\\/14540\",\"title\":\"Social Justice Education with Law Enforcement: Reflections from the Field\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Nation-wide protests over the systemic racism embedded in and embodied by law enforcement has sparked a call to action, a call that has particular resonance and urgency for social justice educators.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement.

Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields.

This article examines the discourses of denial that feature in the talk of local anti-racism actors in Australia, and asks what drives these discourses. The research draws on qualitative interviews undertaken with participants involved in local anti-racism in two case study areas, one in South Australia and the other in New South Wales. This article explores the way local participants in the case study areas deployed four discourses to deny or minimise racism: temporal deflections; spatial deflections; deflections from the mainstream; and absence discourses. Place defending and the desire to protect one's local area from being branded a racist space is discussed as a driver of those local denial discourses. Local denial of racism is also linked to national politics of racism and anti-racism. In particular, the Australian government's retreat from multiculturalism, and the preference for 'harmony' rather than 'anti-racism' initiatives, was linked to the avoidance of the language of racism within participants' responses. The way denial discourses narrow the range of possibilities for local anti-racism is discussed, as is the importance of acknowledgement of racism, particularly institutional and systemic racism. Public acknowledgement of these forms of racism will broaden the scope of local anti-racism.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"XXXXXX - Unknown; anti-racism; Aboriginal Australians; Australia; denial; racism; discrimination; multiculturalism; reconciliation\",\"subject\":\"XXXXXX - Unknown; anti-racism; Aboriginal Australians; Australia; denial; racism; discrimination; multiculturalism; reconciliation\",\"authors\":\"Nelson, Jacqueline (R17218)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/handle.uws.edu.au:8081\\/1959.7\\/524326\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"63c0e726ee49933cfc6fa6625e67d67ac5ab98376f7c408a190508339a991553\",\"relevance\":76},{\"id\":\"3628a175d69110ba2eff807b50a84c1227a21edcef81915ce3577f6c3635317b\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18562; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p55\",\"title\":\"\\u201cI believe in that movement and I believe in that chant\\u201d: The influence of Black Lives Matter on resilience and empowerment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Over the past few years, systemic racism has been increasingly in the news via the work of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.

To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 55-72 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Owing to its roots in the environmental justice movement, addressing systemic racism is central to climate justice praxis in the United States, which is a necessary intervention in typically technocratic climate politics. What emerges from US climate justice is a moral appeal to \\u2018relationship\\u2019 as politics, the procedural demand that communities of color (the \\u2018frontline\\u2019) lead the movement, and a distributive claim on carbon pricing revenue. However, this praxis precludes a critique of racial capitalism, the process that relies on structural racism to enhance accumulation, alienating, exploiting, and immiserating black, brown, and white, while carrying out ecocide. The lack of an analysis of how class and race produce the crises climate justice confronts prevents the movement from demanding that global north fossil fuel abolition occur in tandem with the reassertion of the public over the private and de-growth. Drawing on research conducted primarily in Oregon and Washington, I argue that race works to both create and limit the transformative possibilities of climate politics.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Sciences, Vol 7, Iss 10, p 192 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"climate justice movement; carbon pricing; racial capitalism; de-growth; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"climate justice movement; carbon pricing; racial capitalism; de-growth; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Rachel Slocum\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/socsci7100192\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"3106dddcb4c5404f49406bef81c9de4739718a27531f23eb981f22f2ec1723fb\",\"relevance\":71},{\"id\":\"57fdd921ece72ac0e8b6a2f5edc26babf89bb557b686311ab115549f96926653\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1128\\/aem.01733-20; https:\\/\\/syndication.highwire.org\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1128\\/AEM.01733-20\",\"title\":\"The ASM Journals Committee Values the Contributions of Black Microbiologists\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Black lives matter.

Simultaneously, there has been a sevenfold increase in the prison population in the United States, in which African Americans are eight times more likely to be jailed than Whites (Western 2006, p. 3). In this paper, I draw on scholarship in history and sociology, as well as my own anthropological research, to develop the argument that criminal justice policies and immigration policies together disempower low-wage U.S. labor and maintain categorical racial inequalities in a \\u201cpostracial\\u201d United States. First, I review the historical role of race in U.S. immigration policy, and I consider the evidence for systemic racism in immigration enforcement in the contemporary period. Second, I discuss criminal legislation in the neoliberal era and examine the ways in which criminal legislation and immigration policies together disempower large segments of the U.S. workforce, satisfying employer demands for low cost and pliant labor. Finally, I argue that a political focus on immigrant workers' \\u201cillegality\\u201d masks the role of the state in (re)defining the legal status of low-wage workers and veils the ways in which punitive policies maintain historical racial and class inequalities.\",\"published_in\":\"Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race ; volume 9, issue 2, page 339-353 ; ISSN 1742-058X 1742-0598\",\"year\":\"2012\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Gomberg-Mu\\u00f1oz, Ruth\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s1742058x11000579\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"dd826f05f8439ecb4d67b5261046acdb31b630f472f39cd5d9b92b0cbf1b20ed\",\"relevance\":67},{\"id\":\"26251806a7c7753005967559d8a1a9ce7026775140c7acaf29a19947c0028080\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/tidsskrift.dk\\/lev\\/article\\/view\\/112681\\/161436; https:\\/\\/tidsskrift.dk\\/lev\\/article\\/view\\/112681; doi:10.7146\\/lev.v0i4.112681\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/tidsskrift.dk\\/lev\\/article\\/view\\/112681; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7146\\/lev.v0i4.112681\",\"title\":\"Popular Science Articles and Academic Reports on the Topics of Cultural Commodification and Institutionalised Racism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper examines two aspects within cultural studies, namely that of cultural commodification and institutionalised racism.

These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism.

This is justified by the requirement for universities to work towards monitoring and evaluating efforts to create non-discriminatory and inclusive training environments. Methods This study employed qualitative research methods. Ten Black African medical specialists were interviewed about their training experiences in two university training hospitals in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Interview data was collected using open-ended questions and coded and analysed using thematic and critical discursive analysis techniques. Results Four experiential themes emerged from the interview data, they included: 1) experiences of everyday racism during work hours, 2) the physical and psychological effects of tokenism and an increased need to perform, 3) institutional racism as a result of inconsistent and unclear methods of promotion and clinical competence building, and 4) an organisational culture that was experienced as having a race and gender bias. Conclusion This is a pilot study and there are limits on the generalizability of the data due to the small sample. What is clear from our participants, though, is the strong experiential component of finding it challenging to be a Black trainee in a White-dominated profession.

A long history of systemic racism has made these women extremely vulnerable to violent crimes. Most of their fates remain a mystery, but some murderers have been caught who are responsible for their deaths. I examined the news articles that cover the crimes of convicted murderers Robert Pickton and John Martin Crawford. Of the two, only Pickton is very well known. However, while the media covered his crimes extensively, much of the coverage is misleading. The aboriginality of the victims is downplayed, and other tactics are used to blame the victims and focus on the killer. The coverage surrounding John Martin Crawford uses similar misleading strategies, although there is significantly less of it. I argue that because the aboriginality of the victims was emphasized instead of downplayed in the coverage of Crawford\\u2019s murders, there was less interest in the cases. Most people will read about crimes when they can identify with the victims. While most of Pickton\\u2019s victims were aboriginal, the number of victims was so enormous and the details of the case were so grisly, that the aboriginality was downplayed to attract the attention that these other aspects gave the case. Crawford\\u2019s victims were all aboriginal women, but he killed fewer and was not seen as a threat. The media influences how people think about society. If the media continues to treat these types of crimes in this way, the ideas that fuel these crimes will also continue.\",\"published_in\":\"Inquiry@Queen's Undergraduate Research Conference Proceedings; 2013: 7th I@Q Conference Proceedings\",\"year\":\"2018-02-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Cameron, Anna\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ojs.library.queensu.ca\\/index.php\\/inquiryatqueens\\/article\\/view\\/9288\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"15071b47a1b82279b3d82fae12aa7b45a65bdf23c5eb8e2c982c24dfaadae8a7\",\"relevance\":61},{\"id\":\"42f1e1c4aaf4ff87e701b8b8fad47b48d2b17d20f308bde67ccf0493a8982e0a\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/414960; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2158244015621600\",\"title\":\"Media event, racial ramblings, or both?

Informed by media framing theory, we examine print media reports for patterns of presentation as well as representations of both the council and the refugees who were the focus of the reporting.

Bystander anti-racism is conceptualized as action taken by \\u201cordinary\\u201d people in response to incidents of interpersonal or systemic racism. The utility of bystander anti-racism is also demonstrated, with evidence suggesting productive effects for targets and bystanders, as well as perpetrators. The relative merits of confrontational or diplomatic action are reviewed, as is the delicate balance between communicating disapproval and maintaining interpersonal relations. The potential of bystander anti-racism will be enhanced where there are social norms that are intolerant of racism. The literature has paid little attention to the influence of context or to affective drivers of bystander anti-racism.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 55-72 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Racism; Empowerment; Resilience; Black Lives Matter; Philosophy.

Methods Data are from a nationally representative sample of older community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries from the 2015 (N = 5,212) National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). We use stepwise multinomial logistic regression to examine black-white disparities in moves out of community housing to assisted living or a nursing home over two years, before and after adjusting for predisposing (age, gender), enabling (income, housing tenure, Medicaid, living arrangement) and need (activities of daily living [ADL] limitation, physical capacity, self-rated health and dementia) factors. Results Black older adults are less likely to move to assisted living and are more likely to move to a nursing home compared to white older adults. Black-white disparities in moves to nursing homes are explained by black-white differences in enabling and need factors, whereas black-white disparities in moves to assisted living remain even after adjusting for enabling and need factors.

Through preliminary indications from this experimentation high delinquency due to cultural identity and socio-economic status has caused the federal offender population to become diverse. The face of the youth justice system within Canada is rapidly changing. Increasing forms of diversity serves as a principal pattern because the criminalization of minority youth occurs from cultural incompetence, unawareness, and insensitivity. This study recovers the institutional\\/systemic forms of treatment that minority youth face within the criminal justice system. It also further shows that there is no focus on the experiences of minority youth within juvenile correctional facilities due to a lack of information. The examination of criminalized practices, policies and methods of police organizations, correctional institutions and the court of law within Canada reveals institutional racism.

For many Indigenous children and families, mainstream Australian society fails to provide the conditions for social growth because it is built on systemic racism. In order to create the conditions for positive social engagement for Indigenous children and families, there needs to be a social investment framework which recognises that colonisation has impacted negatively on Indigenous social and economic capacity, and which builds on the strengths of Indigenous culture and respects the self-determining rights of Indigenous communities in order to re-build capacity.

No studies have been conducted about how social determinants of health and health care delivery affect their T2DM self-management. The purpose was to describe how social determinants of health and healthcare delivery may influence AA women's T2DM self-management using qualitative descriptive methodology (N = 10). Ten participants were interviewed. Participants' geographical location, education, level of income, health literacy, and systemic racism, that is, healthcare delivery services, for example, inadequate healthcare services, providers' assumptions about the patient's knowledge of diabetes, providers' attitudes toward patients, and stigma related to diabetes as a disease were identified. Understanding the role of social determinants of health and the health care delivery system in influencing T2DM self-management is a powerful tool for providers and practitioners for improving practice and health care policies to decrease health disparities and improve health outcomes among AA women with T2DM. ; This item from the UA Faculty Publications collection is made available by the University of Arizona with support from the University of Arizona Libraries.

Though some critique disparities through a structural lens, others use deficit discourse, blaming families of color and working-class families for educational outcomes. This study examines how state policy insiders explain educational inequity, shedding light on the complex relationship between language and the maintenance of systemic racism and classism in education. Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity. These strategies allowed some policy insiders to strengthen deficit discourse, divert attention from structural issues, and characterize themselves positively while advancing racist and classist ideas. These findings have compelling implications in terms of possibilities for policy changes supportive of educational equity.\",\"published_in\":\"Education Policy Analysis Archives, Vol 23, Iss 0 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"policy discourse; educational equity; race; social class; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"Melanie Bertrand; Wendy Y.

In Australia, enduring barriers to good health and good healthcare remain, in spite of long-standing policy priorities. These barriers include the ongoing reality of colonisation, and silence about its implications. People working in and using the health system need to relate across cultures, but they approach this endeavour witha complex mixture of goodwill, defensiveness, guilt and anxiety. Methods: We analysed what is known in Australia about differentials in access to good care, and the underlying factors that entrench them, as well as strategies for developing mainstream competence in care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and communities. Analysis and Conclusions: The available evidence of differentials in access and quality that are not explained by clinical or demographic variables is unequivocal.Official policy needs to be implemented at the system and organisation level through operational policies, programs and protocols, and through relationships with Aboriginal healthcare providers and community organisations. The concept of racism anxiety provides a way of making one important barrier visible, and moving beyond it can enable people of goodwill to \\u2018see\\u2019 where change is needed, and to see themselves as part of the solution. It is time to get beyond the barriers and attend to practical improvements in care, focused on the care system, not simply on the skills and knowledge of individuals within it.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 2006\\/07 with 153 Aboriginal people living in Adelaide, Australia. Participants were asked about their experience of, and responses to, racism, and the impact of these experiences on their health. Racism was regularly experienced by 93% of participants. Almost two thirds of people felt that racism affected their health. Using a thematic analysis with a particular focus on how agency and structure interacted, a number of key reactions and responses to racism were identified. These included: emotional and physiological reactions; and responses such as gaining support from social networks; confronting the person\\/situation; ignoring it; avoiding situations where they might experience racism; 'minimising' the significance or severity of racism or questioning whether incidents were racist; and consuming alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. A further theme was a conscious decision to not 'allow' racism to affect health. Our study found that most people used more than one of these coping strategies, and that strategies were selected with an awareness of positive and negative health impacts. While individuals demonstrated substantial agency in their responses, there were clear structural constraints on how they reacted and responded. We found that not only was racism potentially detrimental to health, but so too were some responses. However, while some strategies appeared 'healthier' than others, most strategies entailed costs and benefits, and these depended on the meanings of responses for individuals. This paper concludes that initiatives to promote health-protective responses to racism need to consider structural constraints and the overarching goal of reducing systemic racism.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2011\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medical and Health Sciences; Public Health and Health Services; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health\",\"subject\":\"Medical and Health Sciences; Public Health and Health Services; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health\",\"authors\":\"Ziersch, A; Gallaher, G; Baum, F; Bentley, M\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.socscimed.2011.06.058\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"86f7e828be88352847018061bae70cb293ac3ee7d2feb260bd6b7c0b94a4ed47\",\"relevance\":33},{\"id\":\"d8f17b51c49431ab8e0e6f119efc25fa520991e6e5efb2c971de8e6add5c27b7\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.uic.edu\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/spir\\/article\\/view\\/10076\\/8219\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.uic.edu\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/spir\\/article\\/view\\/10076\",\"title\":\"\\u201cMeanwhile I\\u2019m over here butt naked on CNN\\u201d: A multiplatform discourse analysis of the Leslie Jones hack\",\"paper_abstract\":\"On August 24, 2016, comedienne Leslie Jones's personal website was hacked and flooded with sexist and racist imagery stolen largely from her personal accounts. This attack came on the heels of months of online abuse from trolls on Twitter, most recently lead by Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos. Through a multiplatform discourse analysis of the Leslie Jones hack, this paper examines the connections between platform vulnerabilities and the vulnerabilities of women, as well as the links between the rise of the alt-right and the mainstreaming of racist, misogynistic trolling behaviors. Building on Whitney Phillips\\u2019s (2015) arguments about the connections between trolling and mainstream culture, this case study maps a moment when these subcultural behaviors were becoming more dominant and provides a microcosm through which to understand the interconnectedness between digital platforms, politics and Politics, race, and gender. Utilizing a qualitative interpretation of Jean Burgess and Ariadna Matamoros-Fern\\u00e1ndez\\u2019s (2016) multiplatform issue mapping, three key themes emerged: messages of support and affirmation; the need for intervention; and the connection between this incident, systemic racism and sexism, and the rise of the alt-right. Overall, the discourse around Leslie Jones\\u2019s hack evinces the mainstreaming of both policy discourse around online harassment and the supposedly subcultural trolling culture that frequently aligns with the alt-right. While other instances of online harassment have garnered significant media attention, the hatred toward Jones surfaced at a cultural and political tipping point, speaking to larger political divides within the United States.\",\"published_in\":\"AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research; 2017: AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research ; 2162-3317\",\"year\":\"2019-11-05\",\"subject_orig\":\"celebrity; critical discourse analysis; race; gender; sexuality\",\"subject\":\"celebrity; critical discourse analysis; race; gender; sexuality\",\"authors\":\"Lawson, Caitlin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.uic.edu\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/spir\\/article\\/view\\/10076\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d8f17b51c49431ab8e0e6f119efc25fa520991e6e5efb2c971de8e6add5c27b7\",\"relevance\":32},{\"id\":\"dafd171b76d3b5d172693066f2fe12ec32e24895a4ba31e722555f5fbf01c154\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.13016\\/9oq8-xmx4; Paradies, Yin (2006) A systematic review of empirical research on self-reported racism and health.

These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism. Ensuring the quality of studies in this field will allow future research to reveal the complex role that racism plays as a determinant of population health. ; http:\\/\\/ije.oxfordjournals.org\\/content\\/35\\/4\\/888.long\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2006\",\"subject_orig\":\"Health Equity; Disparities; Mental Health; Health Risk Factors; Stress; Research; Race; ethnic groups; racism; discrimination; review\",\"subject\":\"Health Equity; Disparities; Mental Health; Health Risk Factors; Stress; Research; Race; ethnic groups; racism; discrimination; review\",\"authors\":\"Paradies, Yin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1903\\/22785\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"dafd171b76d3b5d172693066f2fe12ec32e24895a4ba31e722555f5fbf01c154\",\"relevance\":31},{\"id\":\"0566d0e55f65b5a1384737b06ecb0d94f480783cbc9e63c7de31668420edf2dd\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unisalento.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18704; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2421-2113; 2421-2113; doi:10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p85; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7b2de7ae5aa7474585ad4f21d77a43d5\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p85; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7b2de7ae5aa7474585ad4f21d77a43d5\",\"title\":\"A call to healing: Black Lives Matter movement as a framework for addressing the health and wellness of Black women\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement re-centered and illuminated the disparities facing the Black population as a result of systemic racism in the United States (U.S.).

Historically, scholarship has focused either on women\\u2019s liberation and feminism, or on civil rights and black liberation.

This special issue, one of three on this topic area that has been put forth in the history of this journal, comes at a critical point in our world. This is a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is systematically infecting Black, Indigenous, and People of Color and when there has been increased attention to systemic racism and intersecting violence inherent in multiple systems, including the justice, health, and educational systems. Using Kilbourne et al. (2016) framework, this special issue focuses on Phase 2 and Phase 3 research. Rather than only identifying health disparities (Phase 1), this issue focuses on understanding mechanisms and translating such understanding into interventions and policy changes. The accepted articles span a wide gamut from obesity to autism to rural populations. Furthermore, the articles provide methods for advancing the field beyond simply noting that systematic differences exist toward strategies to address these inequities. We conclude this introduction by discussing next steps for future research, with hopes that it inspires the next generation to study issues of disparities and inequity in deeper, more meaningful, and impactful ways.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Pediatric Psychology ; volume 45, issue 8, page 833-838 ; ISSN 0146-8693 1465-735X\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Pediatrics, Perinatology, and Child Health; Developmental and Educational Psychology\",\"subject\":\"Pediatrics, Perinatology, and Child Health; Developmental and Educational Psychology\",\"authors\":\"Valrie, Cecelia; Thurston, Idia; Santos,, Melissa\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/jpepsy\\/jsaa066\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"45b38db8398baea8bb55ad34c18d28fe9bbc0f4528e612dcebf60b066da2e7b3\",\"relevance\":28},{\"id\":\"7b29cdcb70a4a7ff3ba006dbd583e7747eafd05b3f23565f0552b1feda78b4e0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2382120517705123; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2382-1205; 2382-1205; doi:10.1177\\/2382120517705123; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/0fdec58b20ea452f92ff54b766bd8bc1\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2382120517705123; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/0fdec58b20ea452f92ff54b766bd8bc1\",\"title\":\"What Influences Mental Illness?

Results: Results showed that students were less likely to perceive a neurotransmitter imbalance to cause mental illness, as opposed to what was emphasized during a formal medical education. Students and residents also understood the importance of factors such as systemic racism and socioeconomic status in the development of mental illness, which were factors that did not receive heavy emphasis during medical education. Furthermore, students and residents believed that not only did mental illnesses have nonuniform pathologies, but that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders also had the propensity to sometimes arbitrarily categorize individuals with potentially negative consequences.

Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity.

The main outcome was the White-Black survival gap. We used 2009-2013 CDC mortality data for Black and White men and women to calculate age-, sex- and race adjusted White and Black mortality rates. We measured segregation using the Dissimilarity index, obtained from the Manhattan Institute. We used the 2009-2013 American Community Survey to define indicators of socioeconomic inequality. We estimated the CBSA-level White-Black gap in probability of survival using sequential linear regression models accounting for the CBSA dissimilarity index and race-specific socioeconomic indicators.Black men and women had a 14% and 9% lower probability of survival from age 35 to 75 than their white counterparts.

The emergent structure and heterogeneity of the urban landscape drives the biotic outcomes observed, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies effectively consider structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes, instead focusing on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. We explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships binding social inequities, specifically racism, and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices - including residential segregation - to the observed heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. As a result, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors driving biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization\\u2019s biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.\",\"published_in\":\"Science ; page eaay4497 ; ISSN 0036-8075 1095-9203\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Multidisciplinary\",\"subject\":\"Multidisciplinary\",\"authors\":\"Schell, Christopher J.; Dyson, Karen; Fuentes, Tracy L.; Des Roches, Simone; Harris, Nyeema C.; Miller, Danica Sterud; Woelfle-Erskine, Cleo A.; Lambert, Max R.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1126\\/science.aay4497\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"09306f9078696c96135bb4a82f7b40ad7eb00e4270bb2f8a529459b0759ecac6\",\"relevance\":24},{\"id\":\"7581d874d9554fb827409a3862b221d8bc38bdecc99327e16f2380befe830538\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2429\\/68365; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12904-019-0404-y\",\"title\":\"Cultural safety strategies for rural Indigenous palliative care: a scoping review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: There is little scholarship on culturally safe approaches to palliative care, especially for rural Indigenous clients.

However, the conceptualization of healthy aging and how age-related issues are addressed in community-based structures, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities, remain poorly understood, especially from the Stakeholder perspective. Stakeholders, such as faith leaders and members of community-based organizations, engage in regular negotiations to advance health equity in their communities by partnering and collaborating with older adults and their families as well as other local and federal organizations. The Stakeholder Engagement in Aging Research and Community Health (SEARCH) Study employs multiple research methods to illuminate Stakeholders\\u2019 perspectives on barriers and facilitators to healthy aging in diverse communities. This presentation highlights findings from in-depth, qualitative interviews with Stakeholders (N=37) serving African American, Latinx, and South Asian older adults. Emergent themes suggest that systemic racism, stigmatization, limited health literacy, and cultural beliefs serve as barriers to healthy aging across groups. Within groups, Stakeholders report precarious immigration status and fragile and fragmented life situations as barriers among Latinx older adults, while acculturative stress presents a challenge to healthy aging in South Asian older adults. Food insecurity and neighborhood factors such as exposure to violence and socio-economic disadvantages act as barriers among African American older adults. Conversely, religious faith and spirituality, familial support, and culturally-congruent care serve as facilitators across groups. The findings from this study underscore the continued need for intersectional, inclusive, and culturally-informed approaches to supporting healthy aging within diverse communities.\",\"published_in\":\"Innovation in Aging ; volume 3, issue Supplement_1, page S961-S961 ; ISSN 2399-5300\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Khan, Mushira; Graham, Karen; Washington, Tarisha; Kim, Abigail; Shah, Raj C; Glover, Crystal M\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/geroni\\/igz038.3484\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"1e82eca688b1b757c5e3c7a4c360f15226169bc6ef8305067aa396db4f996229\",\"relevance\":21},{\"id\":\"4b31f814936d4ff57ef5f42ab7cabae350ef1ebc9138f8233880a1753573ccda\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18704; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p85\",\"title\":\"A call to healing: Black Lives Matter movement as a framework for addressing the health and wellness of Black women\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement re-centered and illuminated the disparities facing the Black population as a result of systemic racism in the United States (U.S.).

It has raised awareness about systemic racism and sexism as well as social and economic conditions experienced by Canada's Indigenous population. Yet, research shows that Indigenous males are the most likely to be murdered in Canada (Mulligan, Axford, & Soecki, 2016). Since Indigenous men are going missing and are murdered in disturbing numbers, and they are fathers, brothers, and sons to Indigenous women and girls, it is understandable that many in the Indigenous community wanted to include them in the inquiry. Our analysis explores how the MMIWG and discourses about inclusion and exclusion have been framed in ways that limit interpretations about the root causes of problems experienced by Indigenous people, especially when they exclude an important part of the Indigenous population Indigenous males. We draw upon Indigenous perceptions of the inquiry and analyses of social norms and stereotypes in order to explore the conflicting positions and experiences associated with missing and murdered Indigenous people in Canada. We conclude by exploring the need for a more comprehensive inquiry. We recognize that a holistic model of inquiry that honours the voices of Indigenous communities is crucial to a proper investigation into missing and murdered Indigenous people in Canada.\",\"published_in\":\"International Indigenous Policy Journal, Vol 10, Iss 1 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"missing and murdered Indigenous people; justice; social exclusion; Political science; J; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"missing and murdered Indigenous people; justice; social exclusion; Political science; J; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"John G.

The dominant discourses around these issues focus on and often seek to silence racism or diminish its occurrence in the society, in other words: deflections and denial of racism dominate. Such denials and deflections belie the lived experiences of racism among racial(ised) minorities. Perhaps not surprisingly therefore, within such a context, there is a paucity of research on how community development practice engages with issues of race, racialisation, racism and racial inequalities. Little is known about how community development practitioners work with\\/in racially diverse communities or the extent to which Australian community development practice employs a \\u2018race lense\\u2019 in its practice. The discussions in this paper therefore emanate from an understanding that \\u2018colour (race)-blind\\u2019 practice still dominates community development work in Australia. The main contention is that unexamined colour-blind practice has the potential to reproduce systemic racism or systems of racial inequalities. The question informing this paper therefore, is: what is the significance of race in community development practice in Australia? To address this question, the paper centres \\u201cthe experienced reality of lived racism\\u201d (Essed, 1991, p. vii) by black African migrants in Australia - which highlight the pervasiveness of racism in their everyday lives - to argue the need for conversations and considerations about race and inclusion within the field of community development. In the end, the discussions in this paper will raise important questions about the significance of race in community development practice in Australia and the consequences of race-blind practice and colour-mutism when working with\\/in ethnic and racially diverse communities.

The main outcome was the White-Black survival gap. We used 2009-2013 CDC mortality data for Black and White men and women to calculate age-, sex- and race adjusted White and Black mortality rates. We measured segregation using the Dissimilarity index, obtained from the Manhattan Institute. We used the 2009-2013 American Community Survey to define indicators of socioeconomic inequality. We estimated the CBSA-level White-Black gap in probability of survival using sequential linear regression models accounting for the CBSA dissimilarity index and race-specific socioeconomic indicators.Black men and women had a 14% and 9% lower probability of survival from age 35 to 75 than their white counterparts. Residential segregation was strongly associated with the survival gap, and this relationship was partly, but not fully, explained by socioeconomic inequality. At the lowest observed level of segregation, and with the Black socioeconomic status (SES) assumed to be at the White SES level scenario, the survival gap is essentially eliminated.White-Black differences in survival remain wide notwithstanding public health efforts to improve life expectancy and initiatives to reduce health disparities. Eliminating racial residential segregation and bringing Black socioeconomic status (SES) to White SES levels would eliminate the White-Black survival gap.\",\"published_in\":\"PLoS ONE, Vol 13, Iss 2, p e0193222 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"subject\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"authors\":\"Ioana Popescu; Erin Duffy; Joshua Mendelsohn; Jos\\u00e9 J Escarce\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/journal.pone.0193222\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8f0a25dd129291ac508ca178fdd27b9eef630a5c6291799b8a4d7a89ea821c5d\",\"relevance\":15},{\"id\":\"638c936fe447341faba75967543c3a284e6800cd10bab62d672154ce2290cb0d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/refuge.journals.yorku.ca\\/index.php\\/refuge\\/article\\/view\\/21235\\/19906; https:\\/\\/refuge.journals.yorku.ca\\/index.php\\/refuge\\/article\\/view\\/21235; doi:10.25071\\/1920-7336.21235\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/refuge.journals.yorku.ca\\/index.php\\/refuge\\/article\\/view\\/21235; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25071\\/1920-7336.21235\",\"title\":\"Refugees and Racism in Canada\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The terms race and racism are defined, and the history of their use in Canada since Confederation is examined.

Although racialized youth account for half of the youth population in Canadian cities like Toronto, their experience in public libraries is an unstudied area of Canadian LIS scholarly and professional research. Existing research approaches youth as a homogenous group in terms of age and biological stages and does not account for race, class, and urbanism. However, racialized youth face different challenges in which race and systemic racism are a facet of everyday life. This workaims to reverse racial neutrality in public libraries by demonstrating how ambivalence about race perpetuates systemic inequalities and the disengagement of racialized youth. It draws on interdisciplinary research to show how the race-blind approach is not reflective of the needs of communities being served. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, it shows that public libraries can implement processes to gather race-specific data under the recently-implemented Anti-Racism Act (2017).

Targeted discrimination and intergenerational trauma have undermined the health and wellbeing of Australia\\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, leading to significantly poorer health status, social impoverishment and inequity resulting in the over-representation of Aboriginal people in Australian prisons. Despite adoption of the \\u2018equal treatment\\u2019 principle, on entering prison in Australia entitlements to the national universal healthcare system are revoked and Aboriginal people lose access to health services modelled on Aboriginal concepts of culturally safe healthcare available in the community. Incarcerated Aboriginal women experience poorer health outcomes than incarcerated non-Indigenous women and Aboriginal men, yet little is known about their experiences of accessing healthcare. We report the findings of the largest qualitative study with incarcerated Aboriginal women in New South Wales (NSW) Australia in over 15 years. Methods We employed a decolonizing research methodology, \\u2018community collaborative participatory action research\\u2019, involving consultation with Aboriginal communities prior to the study and establishment of a Project Advisory Group (PAG) of community expert Aboriginal women to guide the project. Forty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2013 with Aboriginal women in urban and regional prisons in NSW. We applied a grounded theory approach for the data analysis with guidance from the PAG. Results Whilst Aboriginal women reported positive and negative experiences of prison healthcare, the custodial system created numerous barriers to accessing healthcare. Aboriginal women experienced institutional racism and discrimination in the form of not being listened to, stereotyping, and inequitable healthcare compared with non-Indigenous women in prison and the community. Conclusions \\u2018Equal treatment\\u2019 is an inappropriate strategy for providing equitable healthcare, which is required because incarcerated Aboriginal women experience significantly poorer health. Taking a decolonizing approach, we unpack and demonstrate the systems level changes needed to make health and justice agencies culturally relevant and safe. This requires further acknowledgment of the oppressive transgenerational effects of ongoing colonial policy, a true embracing of diversity of worldviews, and critically the integration of Aboriginal concepts of health at all organizational levels to uphold Aboriginal women\\u2019s rights to culturally safe healthcare in prison and the community.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal for Equity in Health, Vol 19, Iss 1, Pp 1-14 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Australia; Prison; Incarceration; Women; Indigenous; Aboriginal; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"Australia; Prison; Incarceration; Women; Indigenous; Aboriginal; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"S.

Health inequities are unjust differences in health and well-being between and within groups of people caused by socially structured, and thus avoidable, marginalizing conditions such as poverty and systemic racism. In Canada, such conditions disproportionately affect Indigenous persons, racialized newcomers, those with mental health and substance use issues, and those experiencing interpersonal violence. Despite calls to enhance equity in health care to contribute to improving population health, few studies examine how to achieve equity at the point of care, and the impacts of doing so. Many people facing marginalizing conditions experience inadequate and inequitable treatment in emergency departments (EDs), which makes people less likely to access care, paradoxically resulting in reliance on EDs through delays to care and repeat visits, interfering with effective care delivery and increasing human and financial costs. EDs are key settings with potential for mitigating the impacts of structural conditions and barriers to care linked to health inequities. Methods EQUIP is an organizational intervention to promote equity. Building on promising research in primary health care, we are adapting EQUIP to emergency departments, and testing its impact at three geographically and demographically diverse EDs in one Canadian province. A mixed methods multisite design will examine changes in key outcomes including: a) a longitudinal analysis of change over time based on structured assessments of patients and staff, b) an interrupted time series design of administrative data (i.e., staff sick leave, patients who leave without care being completed), c) a process evaluation to assess how the intervention was implemented and the contextual features of the environment and process that are influential for successful implementation, and d) a cost-benefit analysis. Discussion This project will generate both process- and outcome-based evidence to improve the provision of equity-oriented health care in emergency departments, particularly targeting groups known to be at greatest risk for experiencing the negative impacts of health and health care inequities. The main deliverable is a health equity-enhancing framework, including implementable, measurable interventions, tested, refined and relevant to diverse EDs.

A Comment on Wolfgang Seibel\\u2018s Process Tracing Analysis of the NSU investigations (2000-2007)Abstract The article comments on \\u201eCausal Mechanisms of Administrative Failure: A Process Tracing Analysis of the Failure of German Law Enforcement Authorities in the Investigation Into the Serial Killing of Immigrants, 2000-2007\\u201d by Wolfgang Seibel. It is argued that Seibel develops a remarkable own hypothesis which is more convincing than the assumption that the German law enforcement authorities were hampered by systemic racism. Moreover, he plausibly classifies several mistakes and deficiencies of the criminal investigations with the help of an impressive spectrum of theoretical approaches. However, it is criticized that Seibel mainly relies on a single source and disproportionately reduces the complex and lengthy investigations to a few situations. He insufficiently explains his selection and application of causal mechanisms. Furthermore, his inferences seem to be biased due to several normative premises. Seibel\\u2019s conclusions do not necessarily and exhaustively explain the failure of the criminal investigations. Finally, the text provides some suggestions to improve future qualitative studies that deal with cases of administrative failure. Particularly the perils of equifinality, censoring, selection bias, and the ex post perspective should be taken into account.

In addition, I challenge students to examine their own biases and stereotypes that influence the ways in which they interact with others (Conle, 2000; Finney & Orr, 1995). The essence of this exercise is to counteract impasses that may arise and create a polarization of ideas. At the outset, I share my belief that I consider instances of conflict or tension within my classroom as moments of potential learning. I also emphasize the complexity of the issues involved, for instance, the course reinforces that there are no easy solutions to practical educational issues. Consequently, I make students aware that rather than offering a \\\"how to list,\\\" the course introduces them to different ways of seeing the world. In this way, I urge students to think critically about education as a social and political institutional tool. At the outset, we need to acknowledge that most of our student teachers are isolated from a significant portion of the population they are likely to teach. In fact, they will likely have little or no knowledge of the variety and strengths of people outside their communities. Such lack of familiarity will result in many teacher candidates relying on stereotypical, homogenizing understandings of racial and cultural groups. Assumptions that Aboriginals are alcoholics, for example or that Blacks are criminals, which are justified by the rhetoric that \\\"they have chosen to live that way.\\\" Such uninformed thinking demonstrates a lack of appreciation for structural issues, which affect the way in which society operates. More specifically, these belief systems fail to acknowledge that society does not provide equal opportunities for all its members. Ignoring these realities, students from middle class backgrounds feel justified in asserting that \\\"These people need to work harder--I have always struggled to better myself.\\\" And hence the myth of a meritocratic society is perpetuated. This biased thinking also obscures the fact that power and privilege are accorded only to select groups, based on social markers such as gender, class, race, sexual orientation and able-bodiedness. Further, many students forget the historical trauma, the legacies of colonialism, slavery and contemporary consequences within which many non-white populations find themselves saddled. There are several barriers that could make introduction of an anti-racist pedagogy difficult: unconscious and institutional racism, systemic racism and stereotypes. Unconscious racism is deeply embedded in an individual's personal belief system and may interfere with an individual's ability to accept more inclusive ways of teaching. We must recognize that knowledge is socially constructed and mediated by sociocultural, historical and institutional contexts. In my view, a school curriculum must present students with socially relevant and challenging new knowledge so that they, in collaboration with their teachers, can engage in a meaningful dialogue and become more informed members of their communities.

Thus, it is important to articulate how cultural safety can be enacted to support rural Indigenous Peoples and communities at end of life. We sought to identify strategies described in existing literature that have potential to deepen our understanding of culturally safe approaches to palliative care within rural and small-town settings in Canada. Methods We searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature about Indigenous palliative care in rural and small-town settings in Canada, United States, New Zealand, and Australia. Medline, CINAHL, and Embase were searched. We thematically analyzed 22 resulting articles to address our interest in culturally safe approaches to palliative care in rural\\/small-town and on-reserve contexts. Results The following themes were extracted from the literature: symbolic or small gestures; anticipating barriers to care; defer to client, family and community; shared decision-Making; active patient and family involvement; respectful, clear, and culturally appropriate communication; community ownership of services; empower cultural identity, knowledge, and traditions; and, policy. Discussion Culturally competent practices can improve Indigenous palliative care services; however, they do not result in decolonized care. Strategies include: symbolic or small gestures; anticipating barriers to access; deferring to the client, family, and community members; and, collective decision making and family involvement. Culturally safe approaches contribute to institutional or organizational change and decolonized care. Strategies include: involvement of patient and family in service planning; reflection about individual and systemic racism; community ownership of services and; recognizing distinct Worldviews that shape care. Conclusions Culturally safe strategies invite decolonization of care through awareness of colonialism, racism, and discrimination. They invite commitment to building partnerships, power sharing, and decision-making in the delivery of care. Culturally competent activities may catalyze the adoption of a cultural safety framework; however, mislabeling of cultural competency as cultural safety may contribute to organizational inaction and a watering down of the spirit of cultural safety.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Palliative Care, Vol 18, Iss 1, Pp 1-13 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Indigenous; Palliative care; Cultural safety; Cultural competency; End of life; Special situations and conditions; RC952-1245\",\"subject\":\"Indigenous; Palliative care; Cultural safety; Cultural competency; End of life; Special situations and conditions; \",\"authors\":\"Kaela Schill; Susana Caxaj\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12904-019-0404-y\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"623895029730bfb4a9f12d34255cb369d092206efe6cae0dc556c4fe07283e42\",\"relevance\":8},{\"id\":\"4317c13bfe27c9046239c2ac50a0ef0065f4ddcde2bb574e7d0a3ded92d846c4\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1186\\/s12909-020-02086-5; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1472-6920; doi:10.1186\\/s12909-020-02086-5; 1472-6920; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7a65503a17484302880affbf9a79a42b\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12909-020-02086-5; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7a65503a17484302880affbf9a79a42b\",\"title\":\"\\u201cHow can I do more?\\u201d Cultural awareness training for hospital-based healthcare providers working with high Aboriginal caseload\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Aboriginal cultural awareness training aims to build a culturally responsive workforce, however research has found the training has limited impact on the health professional\\u2019s ability to provide culturally safe care. This study examined cultural awareness training feedback from healthcare professionals working with high Aboriginal patient caseloads in the Top End of the Northern Territory of Australia. The aim of the research was to assess the perception of training and the potential for expansion to better meet workforce needs. Methods Audit and qualitative thematic analysis of cultural awareness training evaluation forms completed by course participants between March and October 2018. Course participants ranked seven teaching domains using five-point Likert scales (maximum summary score 35 points) and provided free-text feedback. Data were analysed using the Framework Method and assessed against Kirkpatrick\\u2019s training evaluation model. Cultural safety and decolonising philosophies shaped the approach. Results 621 participants attended 27 ACAP sessions during the study period. Evaluation forms were completed by 596 (96%). The mean overall assessment score provided was 34\\/35 points (standard deviation 1.0, range 31-35) indicating high levels of participant satisfaction. Analysis of 683 free text comments found participants wanted more cultural education, designed and delivered by local people, which provides an opportunity to consciously explore both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultures (including self-reflection). Regarding the expansion of cultural education, four major areas requiring specific attention were identified: communication, kinship, history and professional relevance. A strength of this training was the authentic personal stories shared by local Aboriginal cultural educators, reflecting community experiences and attitudes. Criticism of the current model included that too much information was delivered in one day. Conclusions Healthcare providers found cultural awareness training to be an invaluable entry point. Cultural education which elevates the Aboriginal health user\\u2019s experience and provides health professionals with an opportunity for critical self-reflection and practical solutions for common cross-cultural clinical encounters may improve the delivery of culturally safe care. We conclude that revised models of cultural education should be developed, tested and evaluated. This requires institutional support, and recognition that cultural education can contribute to addressing systemic racism.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Medical Education, Vol 20, Iss 1, Pp 1-11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Aboriginal; Indigenous; cultural awareness; cultural safety; unconscious bias; hospital training; Special aspects of education; LC8-6691\",\"subject\":\"Aboriginal; Indigenous; cultural awareness; cultural safety; unconscious bias; hospital training; Special aspects of education; \",\"authors\":\"Vicki Kerrigan; Nicole Lewis; Alan Cass; Marita Hefler; Anna P.

Health inequities are unjust differences in health and well-being between and within groups of people caused by socially structured, and thus avoidable, marginalizing conditions such as poverty and systemic racism. In Canada, such conditions disproportionately affect Indigenous persons, racialized newcomers, those with mental health and substance use issues, and those experiencing interpersonal violence. Despite calls to enhance equity in health care to contribute to improving population health, few studies examine how to achieve equity at the point of care, and the impacts of doing so. Many people facing marginalizing conditions experience inadequate and inequitable treatment in emergency departments (EDs), which makes people less likely to access care, paradoxically resulting in reliance on EDs through delays to care and repeat visits, interfering with effective care delivery and increasing human and financial costs. EDs are key settings with potential for mitigating the impacts of structural conditions and barriers to care linked to health inequities. Methods: EQUIP is an organizational intervention to promote equity. Building on promising research in primary health care, we are adapting EQUIP to emergency departments, and testing its impact at three geographically and demographically diverse EDs in one Canadian province. A mixed methods multisite design will examine changes in key outcomes including: a) a longitudinal analysis of change over time based on structured assessments of patients and staff, b) an interrupted time series design of administrative data (i.e., staff sick leave, patients who leave without care being completed), c) a process evaluation to assess how the intervention was implemented and the contextual features of the environment and process that are influential for successful implementation, and d) a cost-benefit analysis. Discussion: This project will generate both process- and outcome-based evidence to improve the provision of equity-oriented health care in emergency departments, particularly targeting groups known to be at greatest risk for experiencing the negative impacts of health and health care inequities. The main deliverable is a health equity-enhancing framework, including implementable, measurable interventions, tested, refined and relevant to diverse EDs.

Racism is a belief that some groups are superior while some other groups are inferior. Discrimination is the unequal or unfair and violence actions toward others, basically based on their race, skin color and belief. Rebellion is an action or a movement against the pressures which comes from the outside. Those three issues can be found in the movies Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The purposes of this study are to identify and analyze the kinds of racism action from Humans which then emerged the resistance or rebellion from the Apes, and how do the Apes rebel to the Humans. The primary data of this study were collected from Mat Reeves\\u2019s Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) movies. The theory of racism by Henry and Tator, discrimination theories by Theodorson and Theodorson and Larry Willmore and theory of rebellion by Karl Marx and D. E. H. Russel were used as the theoretical framework to find out and analyzed the kinds of racism that the Humans had done to the Apes and the way the Apes do the rebellion action in the movies Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes movies. The result of this study showed that the rebellion action from Apes toward Humans is appropriated with the rebellion theories from Karl Marx and D. E. H. Russel. The Apes did the rebellion actions toward the Humans because of the unfair treatments, racism and discrimination treatments from the Humans. Furthermore, the result of Ape\\u2019s rebellion towards Human in the movies is only the destruction. Key words: individual racism, interpersonal racism, systemic racism, institutional racism, discrimination. ABSTRAK Rasisme, diskriminasi dan pemberontakan adalah tiga persoalan yang masih eksis didunia sampai saat ini. Rasisme adalah sebuah paham bahwa ada sebagian kelompok yang unggul dan sebagian tidak. Diskriminasi adalah perlakuan yang tidak adil atau pembedaan perlakuan dan kekerasan terhadap orang lain, biasanya berdasarkan ras, warna kulit dan kepercayaan. Pemberontakan adalah sebuah tindakan atau sebuah pergerakan melawan ancaman yang datang dari luar. Ketiga persoalan tersebut dapat dijumpai didalam film Rise of the Planet of the Apes dan Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Adapun tujuan dari studi ini adalah untuk menidentifikasi dan menganalisa jenis-jenis tindakan rasismme yang dilakukan oleh kelompok manusia yang menyebabkan terjadinya perlawanan atau pemberontakan dari kelompok kera dan bagaimana cara kelompok kera memberontak kepada kelompok manusia. Data utama dari studi ini diambil dari karyanya Matt Reeves, yaitu film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) dan Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). Adapun teori rasisme menggunakan teori dari Henry and Tator, teori diskriminasi dari Theodorson and Theodorsondan Larry Willmore dan teori pemberontakan dari Karl Marx dan D. E. H. Russel. Teori-teori tersebut merupakan teori utama yang digunakan untuk menganalisa macam-macam rasisme yang dilakukan oleh kelompok manusia terhadap kelompok kera, dan bentuk atau cara dari aksi pemberontakan yang dilakukan oleh kelompok kera didalam film Rise of the Planet of the Apes dan Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Hasil yang didapatkan dari studi ini menunjukkan bahwa aksi pemberontakan yang dilakukan oleh kelompok kera selaras dengan teori dari Karl Marx dan D. E. H. Russel. Kelompok kera melakukan aksi pemberontakan karena perlakuan yang tidak adil, tindakan diskriminasi dan rasisme dari kelompok manusia. Ironisnya, hasil dari pada aksi pemberontakan yang dilakukan kelompok kera terhadap kelompok manusia hanyalah mendatangkan kehancuran.

He urges the reader to confront the critical tendencies that have sidelined comprehensive analysis of black British art, and move beyond narratives that approach the creative production of black artists instrumentally, as a lens through which, at best, to examine (and, at worst, explain) the social and political implications of race and ethnicity in twentieth century Britain. Echoing Mercer\\u2019s assessment, recent publications by scholars such as Leon Wainwright and, from an American perspective, Darby English have highlighted the ways in which this problematic halfstory has been written both by racism\\u2019s \\u201cinventive way of isolating black realities from the spaces whose purity it would conserve by doing so\\u201d and also \\u2013 notably \\u2013 even by some countermeasures against this systemic racism. Returning to British shores, to these two factors we might also add the dominance of voices from the fields of sociology and cultural theory, not least in important foundational works by Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, in the establishment of early scholarship around \\u201cblack art\\u201d and black British artists. Arguing for a loosely reconfigured version of Erwin Panofsky\\u2019s iconographic model, Mercer offers one possibility for object-based engagement. More recently, English, Wainwright and others have looked to frameworks of materiality and phenomenology (respectively), to de-center narratives of racial and ethnic identity in art historical assessments of works by black and diaspora artists. But, of course, these critiques are not new, nor is the stilted discourse that they observe. They join the voices of Rasheed Araeen, Sonia Boyce, Lubaina Himid, Eddie Chambers, Keith Piper, Veronica Ryan, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, Marlene Smith, and others, a chorus gathering force since the late 1970s, when the constellation of artists, activists, and critics of what has come to be known, in some circles, as the Black Arts Movement burst on the British art scene. Working in relation to questions of \\u201cblackness\\u201d in Britain and the possibilities and implications of a black British art through visual practice and in art-adjacent practices as artist-curators, artist-critics, artist-researchers and artist-archivists, though somewhat imprecise and contested, the Black Arts Movement laid the foundations for the radical art history that lies at the root of Mercer\\u2019s challenge: an art history that accounts for the work of black British artists within the context of wider national and international aesthetic, cultural and historical formations, rather than footnotes haphazardly inserted into mainstream narratives of art in the twentieth century, if they (black British artists) are included at all. This article springs from the interstices of a pair of projects\\u2014one that is wrapping up, and the other starting out\\u2014which continue the work of excavating this art history, building on a rapidly growing literature around the Black Arts Movement in Britain by tracing its roots from the early 1960s. Following the contours of the first two of what Stuart Hall has called \\u201cwaves\\u201d of black arts activity in postwar Britain, this article takes as a starting point a critical examination of the notion of \\u201cblack art\\u201d in a British context in order to unravel attendant questions around the formation and framing of what has come to be generally known as a Black Arts Movement. This mode of engagement with the creative products of black British artists must address, as Mercer notes, \\u201cthe necessity of interpreting the work as a document of the human imagination that exists as an object of aesthetic attention in its own right.\\u201d This is not to say, however, that we should, or even can, disavow the politics of identity or politics more broadly. Indeed, much of the work created during the broad period from the early 1960s is overtly concerned with the radical possibilities made available by the construction and interrogation of identities that are variously and simultaneously defined by race, gender, class, and sexuality. To disentangle aesthetics and politics entirely in these cases would be futile and tell a different, but still problematic, half-story. Rather, building on and supplementing the work that has been done in this field by earlier historians and critics working within identity-based frameworks, this article, and the projects from which it arises, aim to create a more comprehensive understanding of artworks that at times deal explicitly, though not exclusively, with identity, together with wider questions of politics, aesthetics, and the construction of art\\u2019s histories.\",\"published_in\":\"Robles , E 2019 , ' Making Waves : 'Black Art' in Britain before the 1980s ' , Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art , vol. 45 , pp. 48-61 . https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1215\\/10757163-7916856\",\"year\":\"2019-11-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Rasheed Araeen; David Oluwale; Stuart Hall; black British art history; AfroAsian definitions of black\",\"subject\":\"Rasheed Araeen; David Oluwale; Stuart Hall; black British art history; AfroAsian definitions of black\",\"authors\":\"Robles, Elizabeth\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1983\\/657a76ad-3392-43e9-b908-b8f45bcda874\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"cd7e1d58fa8be83dc90e78ef68e93fee665d654864ae957eb450c912e52c68a6\",\"relevance\":3},{\"id\":\"8dfffb10ed413b9f2ad3553d7436675a303e2475a2a3be304333087d1c474606\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.policyschool.ca\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2019\\/01\\/Economic-Immigrants-Vineberg-final.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2560-8312; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2560-8320; doi:10.11575\\/sppp.v12i0.53036; 2560-8312; 2560-8320; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/69cb6187544b4e49875362ba3470eaaf\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.11575\\/sppp.v12i0.53036; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/69cb6187544b4e49875362ba3470eaaf\",\"title\":\"Improving Canada\\u2019s Selection of Economic Immigrants\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Immigrants coming to Canada over the last two decades have been doing considerably worse in terms of economic outcomes than in previous decades and observers could be missing the real reason why.

But one likely possibility has not yet been seriously considered: that changes in the early 1990s to the way economic immigrants are processed may have resulted in a system that is poorer at selecting those immigrants likeliest to succeed in Canada. The good news is that this problem is fixable. There is no question that the decline in wages and labour-force participation among immigrants, and their rise in poverty rates, is striking. While, in 1980, employed immigrant men earned 85 cents for every dollar earned by employed Canadian men, that had fallen by 2005 to 63 cents. For employed immigrant women, earnings fell from 85 cents of every dollar earned by Canadian-born women in 1980 to 65 cents in 2005. While Canadian-born people saw entry-level earnings rise by 20 per cent between 1981 and 2007, wages for immigrants classified under the Federal Skilled Worker program went the opposite direction, actually falling by more than 20 per cent over the same period. In addition, the number of immigrants who live below Statistics Canada\\u2019s low-income cut off grew by more than a third since 1991, even as the number of Canadian-born people below the cut off shrank by a third over the same period. It is hard not to notice that the declines in outcomes began right after changes were made to the way these immigrants were evaluated for entry into Canada. Most significant was replacing in-person interviews with so-called \\u201cperfected applications\\u201d submitted by mail, and later, online. Under the previous procedure, an interview with an immigration officer would often flesh out important information concealed by an impersonal application. For example, the policy was to interview those applicants who fell just short of qualifying under Canada\\u2019s 1 points-based system. This was in case something was discovered during the in-person interview that gave the officer reason to add extra points or recommend admission anyway. Likewise, those applicants who looked good on paper were sometimes deemed by an officer to be less qualified than their application suggested. Today, applicants typically hire lawyers or consultants to fill out their application and those professionals know how to make an application look good. If the government wants to improve outcomes for immigrants, it should run a pilot program with two streams of applicants in one or more intake offices: assess half of them using the current procedure and the other half using the old interview method, then measure their outcomes over the years. That should be done alongside other improvements to the immigration system, including: lifting the caps on provincial nominees, who have a stronger record of success; providing Canadian Experience Class applicants a shorter route to immigration, so they don\\u2019t abandon their attempts; reintroducing a limited version of the Assisted Relative Class; and reducing larger immigration offices in overseas capitals in favour of smaller, more regional offices nearer newer immigrant pools.

For example, the policy was to interview those applicants who fell just short of qualifying under Canada\\u2019s 1 points-based system. This was in case something was discovered during the in-person interview that gave the officer reason to add extra points or recommend admission anyway. Likewise, those applicants who looked good on paper were sometimes deemed by an officer to be less qualified than their application suggested. Today, applicants typically hire lawyers or consultants to fill out their application and those professionals know how to make an application look good. If the government wants to improve outcomes for immigrants, it should run a pilot program with two streams of applicants in one or more intake offices: assess half of them using the current procedure and the other half using the old interview method, then measure their outcomes over the years. That should be done alongside other improvements to the immigration system, including: lifting the caps on provincial nominees, who have a stronger record of success; providing Canadian Experience Class applicants a shorter route to immigration, so they don\\u2019t abandon their attempts; reintroducing a limited version of the Assisted Relative Class; and reducing larger immigration offices in overseas capitals in favour of smaller, more regional offices nearer newer immigrant pools. As the government moves to increase immigration levels, these changes could make Canada\\u2019s already highly successful immigration system even more successful. ; SeriesInformation ; The School of Public Policy Publications, Vol 12 (2019)\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Vineberg, Robert\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.11575\\/SPPP.V12I0.53036\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"47f5790fb812b7cbce36655af4569ea353cf12bf7164a383b5aa24ce0b2ca775\",\"relevance\":1}]",

The Measure of Indigenous Racism Experiences [MIRE] assesses racism across several dimensions in an urban Indigenous context. This paper presents findings from 312 Indigenous volunteers who responded to the MIRE as part of the Darwin Region Urban Indigenous Diabetes study. Interpersonal racism was reported by 70 per cent of participants, most commonly from service providers and in employment and public settings. A third of respondents had high levels of internalized racism while two-thirds acknowledged the existence of systemic racism. Interpersonal and systemic racism were most commonly reported among older respondents, those of higher socioeconomic position and among those who identified strongly with their culture. Further research is needed to understand the impact of racism on Indigenous people and to determine how to combat racism in Australian society.

While the literature suggests that it is essential for Black women to connect with one another in order to overcome the obstacles they face within the academy, the effects of systemic racism and their underrepresentation in the profession makes this recommendation extremely difficult to implement in some settings, and nearly impossible in others. Black feminist thought and critical race theory provide a theoretical framework for discussing innovative connective opportunities that promote the success of Black women working in higher education.

Although racialized youth account for half of the youth population in Canadian cities like Toronto, their experience in public libraries is an unstudied area of Canadian LIS scholarly and professional research. Existing research approaches youth as a homogenous group in terms of age and biological stages and does not account for race, class, and urbanism. However, racialized youth face different challenges in which race and systemic racism are a facet of everyday life. This work aims to reverse racial neutrality in public libraries by demonstrating how ambivalence about race perpetuates systemic inequalities and the disengagement of racialized youth. It draws on interdisciplinary research to show how the race-blind approach is not reflective of the needs of communities being served. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, it shows that public libraries can implement processes to gather race-specific data under the recently-implemented Anti-Racism Act (2017). This will provide a contextual understanding of the racial make-up of users and provide a valuable frame of reference to support efforts to build stronger and more effective relationships.

Similar to large institutions, human service agencies may maintain racism due to established patterns of Eurocentricity. Agencies also function as entities where change can be affected. The following case study is about the process of decentering whiteness at a feminist health organisation located in an urban centre in the United States. The author, a white, non-binary woman, serving on the board of directors, offered to present a graduate paper at an agency-wide meeting. Preparations for this presentation evolved into a year-long process, during which time the agency began to grapple with the limitations of a cultural competence framework in its services for women\\u2019s and trans health.Feminist intersectionality theory is used to examine the organisation\\u2019s steps towards facing its Eurocentricity. This case study provides examples from organisational practice, during a year of racial turbulence, to explore three strategies that human service agencies commonly use to avoid confronting internal issues of race. It deconstructs past events in which staff maintained systemic racism through (1) disowning past harm, (2) suppression of criticism, and (3) deflection of responsibility through white feminine fragility.A narrative of events is analysed with the support of scholarship to explore how an intersectional approach can address gaps in the flawed implementation of a cultural competence framework. Intersectionality theory can transform ways of thinking among human service providers to promote critical analysis of racism within agency settings. This framework also shows the connection between systemic racism and the delegitimisation of individuals, an essential concept to the task of decentering whiteness within human service organisations.

In some respects, Levinas\\u2019s thought is profoundly constructive and useful; however, his ahistorical, asymmetrical account of intersubjectivity is inadequate to explain what an apology seeks to achieve on a substantial political level. For this, I believe we must articulate a Levinasian-inspired account of the self\\u207bother relation that more adequately takes into account both parties as well as the concrete situation in which the need for apology arises.

In this qualitative study, we examine preservice school librarians' experiences with booktalking multicultural literature in a mixed reality simulation environment, as a vehicle to introduce social justice issues. Our purpose was to explore the booktalking experience as a means of developing preservice librarians' understanding of culturally relevant pedagogy, a stance concerned with developing cultural competence and critical consciousness. Our findings revealed that preservice librarians gained different levels of understanding of culturally relevant pedagogy yet, the experience provided them with an opportunity for engaging in critical reflection regarding personal bias and systemic racism in schools and literature.

Gender, race, class, and other social identities render Indigenous and Black women more susceptible and vulnerable to a web of inequalities that inflict violence on their bodies, lands, and communities. In response, Indigenous and Black women have been building grassroots social and environmental justice movements for decades to challenge the legal, political, and corporate agendas that sanction and enable environmental violence in their communities. This article examines the disproportionate social, economic, and health impacts of multiple forms of environmental violence in the lives of Indigenous and Black women in Canada, including low income and poverty, systemic racism in employment and law enforcement, and environmental racism and climate change. The article also calls attention to the transformative human agency of these women by illuminating their legacy of grassroots mobilizing and activism against the various forms of environmental violence in their communities.

The play opened to divergent audience reactions in East Jerusalem, igniting controversy, and leading to the expression of opinions that ranged from absolute support to clear opposition. This article discusses the play's intervention into an orientalist rhetorical context, showing how reversing traditional orientalist ventriloquisms can be employed as a key strategy of cultural resistance. An analysis of the production's choices and the critical responses it generated suggests that by consciously representing Jewish characters who struggle with their own religious and national identities through Palestinian performers, the play opens up the possibility of breaking the perception of balance between the occupier and the occupied. Extended to a larger context, a resistant ventriloquism can reveal systemic oppression, rendering injustices visible in cases where systemic racism prevents the colonizer from seeing the condition of the colonized.

Furthermore, we need to understand and reveal how whiteness has been socially constructed because the power of whiteness lies in its invisibility, and that fuels the perpetuation of systemic racism. In making whiteness visible, we can see how it has been wielded as a weapon, which in turn will allow us to see how destructive it is for everyone, whites included. As part of this work, we need to break down the disciplinary boundary between literary studies and critical race theory (a field within legal studies that examines systemic racism in the context of the law). One example of such an interdisciplinary intervention is to bring together Cheryl Harris, a critical race theorist, and Joyce Carol Oates, a novelist. Harris published one of the foundational pieces of critical race theory in 1993 with her law review article \\u201cWhiteness as Property,\\u201d a legal analysis of whiteness, and Oates produced a masterpiece of American literature in 1980 with her novel Bellefleur, a complex story of a powerful white family that spans seven generations. This pairing lays the groundwork for the type of interdisciplinary dialogue we need because, within literary studies, when the novelist is white and the characters are white, there is still very little emphasis on the study of whiteness even though race is a significant focus of attention when the novelist and characters are people of color. Whiteness is still invisible, and that is part of the problem I am describing, both within literary studies and in our society at large. We need an interdisciplinary intervention to pull back the curtain on whiteness, see how it operates, recognize its danger, and dismantle it. Bringing together Harris and Oates, specifically \\u201cWhiteness as Property\\u201d and Bellefleur, can help us do just that as we work towards achieving justice.

Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement.

Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields.

This article examines the discourses of denial that feature in the talk of local anti-racism actors in Australia, and asks what drives these discourses. The research draws on qualitative interviews undertaken with participants involved in local anti-racism in two case study areas, one in South Australia and the other in New South Wales. This article explores the way local participants in the case study areas deployed four discourses to deny or minimise racism: temporal deflections; spatial deflections; deflections from the mainstream; and absence discourses. Place defending and the desire to protect one's local area from being branded a racist space is discussed as a driver of those local denial discourses. Local denial of racism is also linked to national politics of racism and anti-racism. In particular, the Australian government's retreat from multiculturalism, and the preference for 'harmony' rather than 'anti-racism' initiatives, was linked to the avoidance of the language of racism within participants' responses.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

Given the prominence and significance of Kaepernick\\u2019s protest, it is vital to study the far-right social media backlash that propelled boycotts of the NFL, drove news cycles, and positioned celebrity athletes as too privileged to protest oppression. My research is grounded in celebrity studies theory, sport media scholarship, and critical race theory. In this article, I establish the history of systemic racism in the United States that lingers in the microcosm of the NFL and sports media\\u2019s racist treatment of players; I then explore scholarship on celebrity, race, and power that provide a foundation for analyzing Kaepernick\\u2019s protest and the effort to desecrate his celebrity. Analysis of online far-right communities shows that Kaepernick functions as a target for collective far-right outrage, a focal point around which commenters could explore and define their common values, grievances, and identities.

Across the Americas, the hemispheric parallels undergirding collective resistance to anti-Black racism and state-sanctioned violence lend themselves to multifaceted interdisciplinary scholarly examinations. Using transnational anti-Black racism in Latin America as a point of departure, we advance a theorization of critical race theory in education capable of interrogating racist structures of coloniality, modernity, and White supremacy that operate globally to suppress Black humanity and humanness in general. To that extent, we draw from and reposition critical race theory (CRT) from its sociohistoric heritage in the United States and instead conceptualize transnational anti-Black racism vis-\\u00e0-vis a Black Diaspora reading of CRT. Finally, we return to education as a key site of contestation for transnational anti-Black racism and draw implications for the meaning of this global theorization of CRT in urban education, praxis, and educational research. We end by charting new and old directions for CRT in educational research.

Owing to its roots in the environmental justice movement, addressing systemic racism is central to climate justice praxis in the United States, which is a necessary intervention in typically technocratic climate politics. What emerges from US climate justice is a moral appeal to \\u2018relationship\\u2019 as politics, the procedural demand that communities of color (the \\u2018frontline\\u2019) lead the movement, and a distributive claim on carbon pricing revenue. However, this praxis precludes a critique of racial capitalism, the process that relies on structural racism to enhance accumulation, alienating, exploiting, and immiserating black, brown, and white, while carrying out ecocide. The lack of an analysis of how class and race produce the crises climate justice confronts prevents the movement from demanding that global north fossil fuel abolition occur in tandem with the reassertion of the public over the private and de-growth. Drawing on research conducted primarily in Oregon and Washington, I argue that race works to both create and limit the transformative possibilities of climate politics. climate justice movement; carbon pricing; racial capitalism; de-growth; Social Sciences; H Social Sciences, Vol 7, Iss 10, p 192 (2018) Rachel Slocum\"},{\"id\":\"57fdd921ece72ac0e8b6a2f5edc26babf89bb557b686311ab115549f96926653\",\"content\":\"The ASM Journals Committee Values the Contributions of Black Microbiologists Black lives matter.

Simultaneously, there has been a sevenfold increase in the prison population in the United States, in which African Americans are eight times more likely to be jailed than Whites (Western 2006, p. 3). In this paper, I draw on scholarship in history and sociology, as well as my own anthropological research, to develop the argument that criminal justice policies and immigration policies together disempower low-wage U.S. labor and maintain categorical racial inequalities in a \\u201cpostracial\\u201d United States. First, I review the historical role of race in U.S. immigration policy, and I consider the evidence for systemic racism in immigration enforcement in the contemporary period. Second, I discuss criminal legislation in the neoliberal era and examine the ways in which criminal legislation and immigration policies together disempower large segments of the U.S. workforce, satisfying employer demands for low cost and pliant labor. Finally, I argue that a political focus on immigrant workers' \\u201cillegality\\u201d masks the role of the state in (re)defining the legal status of low-wage workers and veils the ways in which punitive policies maintain historical racial and class inequalities.

These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism. Ensuring the quality of studies in this field will allow future research to reveal the complex role that racism plays as a determinant of population health.

This is justified by the requirement for universities to work towards monitoring and evaluating efforts to create non-discriminatory and inclusive training environments. Methods This study employed qualitative research methods. Ten Black African medical specialists were interviewed about their training experiences in two university training hospitals in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Interview data was collected using open-ended questions and coded and analysed using thematic and critical discursive analysis techniques. Results Four experiential themes emerged from the interview data, they included: 1) experiences of everyday racism during work hours, 2) the physical and psychological effects of tokenism and an increased need to perform, 3) institutional racism as a result of inconsistent and unclear methods of promotion and clinical competence building, and 4) an organisational culture that was experienced as having a race and gender bias. Conclusion This is a pilot study and there are limits on the generalizability of the data due to the small sample. What is clear from our participants, though, is the strong experiential component of finding it challenging to be a Black trainee in a White-dominated profession.

A long history of systemic racism has made these women extremely vulnerable to violent crimes. Most of their fates remain a mystery, but some murderers have been caught who are responsible for their deaths. I examined the news articles that cover the crimes of convicted murderers Robert Pickton and John Martin Crawford. Of the two, only Pickton is very well known. However, while the media covered his crimes extensively, much of the coverage is misleading. The aboriginality of the victims is downplayed, and other tactics are used to blame the victims and focus on the killer. The coverage surrounding John Martin Crawford uses similar misleading strategies, although there is significantly less of it. I argue that because the aboriginality of the victims was emphasized instead of downplayed in the coverage of Crawford\\u2019s murders, there was less interest in the cases. Most people will read about crimes when they can identify with the victims. While most of Pickton\\u2019s victims were aboriginal, the number of victims was so enormous and the details of the case were so grisly, that the aboriginality was downplayed to attract the attention that these other aspects gave the case. Crawford\\u2019s victims were all aboriginal women, but he killed fewer and was not seen as a threat. The media influences how people think about society. If the media continues to treat these types of crimes in this way, the ideas that fuel these crimes will also continue.

An analysis of media coverage of the Tamworth Council Sudanese Refugees Resettlement Case (2006) This article presents our analysis of Australian media reporting of the 2006 Tamworth City Council's decision to refuse the resettlement of five Sudanese families in Tamworth (NSW) and subsequent reversal, supposedly due to the pressure brought to bear on the council as a result of the media 'hype.' The question at the core of our analyses is as follows: Did the media play a role in the over-(re)presentation of this case as racist or was it just a case of the media reporting racism? Informed by media framing theory, we examine print media reports for patterns of presentation as well as representations of both the council and the refugees who were the focus of the reporting. We conclude that while the media played a significant role in making visible a case built on racial stereotypes, their reporting also contained racializing and paternalistic stereotyping that contribute to the reproduction of both everyday and systemic racism.

Bystander anti-racism is conceptualized as action taken by \\u201cordinary\\u201d people in response to incidents of interpersonal or systemic racism. The utility of bystander anti-racism is also demonstrated, with evidence suggesting productive effects for targets and bystanders, as well as perpetrators. The relative merits of confrontational or diplomatic action are reviewed, as is the delicate balance between communicating disapproval and maintaining interpersonal relations. The potential of bystander anti-racism will be enhanced where there are social norms that are intolerant of racism. The literature has paid little attention to the influence of context or to affective drivers of bystander anti-racism.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

Methods Data are from a nationally representative sample of older community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries from the 2015 (N = 5,212) National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). We use stepwise multinomial logistic regression to examine black-white disparities in moves out of community housing to assisted living or a nursing home over two years, before and after adjusting for predisposing (age, gender), enabling (income, housing tenure, Medicaid, living arrangement) and need (activities of daily living [ADL] limitation, physical capacity, self-rated health and dementia) factors. Results Black older adults are less likely to move to assisted living and are more likely to move to a nursing home compared to white older adults. Black-white disparities in moves to nursing homes are explained by black-white differences in enabling and need factors, whereas black-white disparities in moves to assisted living remain even after adjusting for enabling and need factors.

Through preliminary indications from this experimentation high delinquency due to cultural identity and socio-economic status has caused the federal offender population to become diverse. The face of the youth justice system within Canada is rapidly changing. Increasing forms of diversity serves as a principal pattern because the criminalization of minority youth occurs from cultural incompetence, unawareness, and insensitivity. This study recovers the institutional\\/systemic forms of treatment that minority youth face within the criminal justice system. It also further shows that there is no focus on the experiences of minority youth within juvenile correctional facilities due to a lack of information. The examination of criminalized practices, policies and methods of police organizations, correctional institutions and the court of law within Canada reveals institutional racism. Racial antagonism within the youth justice system leads to the criminalization of minority youth, which serves as a foundation for why culture shapes the identity of racialized youth.

In response, tools to oppose systemic racism and minimize harm in the classroom as well as recommendations for change and resistance are addressed. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The paper focuses on historical analysis of libraries as institutions within larger educational systems and draws heavily on critical theories as a method of critique. Findings This paper demonstrates that the 45th presidential administration is a logical progression of neoliberalism and institutionalized discrimination, which has had adverse effects on the health and safety of (primarily marginalized) students, library workers and library practice, but that critical reflection and information seeking on part of librarians may provide solutions. Practical implications This paper can be used as a guide for librarians seeking to contextualize the educational environment and apply a critical praxis to information literacy programs. Social implications The reflection presented in this paper can aid in expanding awareness in LIS surrounding issues of equity and justice, and impart urgency and need for institutional change. Originality\\/value Given the lack of diversity in library and information science, this paper provides critical interventions for information literacy practice. The authors\\u2019 unique practical and theoretical backgrounds allow for nuanced discussion and pedagogical creation which directly impacts and addresses key issues of justice and equity in the classroom.

For many Indigenous children and families, mainstream Australian society fails to provide the conditions for social growth because it is built on systemic racism. In order to create the conditions for positive social engagement for Indigenous children and families, there needs to be a social investment framework which recognises that colonisation has impacted negatively on Indigenous social and economic capacity, and which builds on the strengths of Indigenous culture and respects the self-determining rights of Indigenous communities in order to re-build capacity. A holistic, cultural strengthening and self-determination\\/human rights-based framework is the best approach to ensure that Indigenous children have a better future and participate positively in Australian society without forfeiting cultural identity and integrity. A human rights and culturally respectful framework can facilitate a \\u2018meeting place\\u2019 where Indigenous cultures can engage with the dominant culture and positive partnerships for social investment can be developed.

An Analysis of Media Coverage of the Tamworth Council Sudanese Refugees Resettlement Case (2006) This article presents our analysis of Australian media reporting of the 2006 Tamworth City Council\\u2019s decision to refuse the resettlement of five Sudanese families in Tamworth (NSW) and subsequent reversal, supposedly due to the pressure brought to bear on the council as a result of the media \\u201chype.\\u201d The question at the core of our analyses is as follows: Did the media play a role in the over-(re)presentation of this case as racist or was it just a case of the media reporting racism? Informed by media framing theory, we examine print media reports for patterns of presentation as well as representations of both the council and the refugees who were the focus of the reporting. We conclude that while the media played a significant role in making visible a case built on racial stereotypes, their reporting also contained racializing and paternalistic stereotyping that contribute to the reproduction of both everyday and systemic racism.

We first explain how we came to this work as education scholars trained to examine systemic racism in educational institutions. We then explain the steps we have taken to pursue our current study that examines the portrayal of Latinx in children's literature. First, we describe an online library catalog platform that we have created to catalog a book collection of over 300 books by\\/about Latinx people published in the United States during a five-year period from 2011 to 2015. Next, we outline our understanding of two prevalent research approaches in critical analyses of children and youth literature, Critical Multicultural Analysis (CMA) and CCA.

Though some critique disparities through a structural lens, others use deficit discourse, blaming families of color and working-class families for educational outcomes. This study examines how state policy insiders explain educational inequity, shedding light on the complex relationship between language and the maintenance of systemic racism and classism in education. Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity.

In Australia, enduring barriers to good health and good healthcare remain, in spite of long-standing policy priorities. These barriers include the ongoing reality of colonisation, and silence about its implications. People working in and using the health system need to relate across cultures, but they approach this endeavour witha complex mixture of goodwill, defensiveness, guilt and anxiety. Methods: We analysed what is known in Australia about differentials in access to good care, and the underlying factors that entrench them, as well as strategies for developing mainstream competence in care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients and communities. Analysis and Conclusions: The available evidence of differentials in access and quality that are not explained by clinical or demographic variables is unequivocal.Official policy needs to be implemented at the system and organisation level through operational policies, programs and protocols, and through relationships with Aboriginal healthcare providers and community organisations. The concept of racism anxiety provides a way of making one important barrier visible, and moving beyond it can enable people of goodwill to \\u2018see\\u2019 where change is needed, and to see themselves as part of the solution. It is time to get beyond the barriers and attend to practical improvements in care, focused on the care system, not simply on the skills and knowledge of individuals within it.

Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 2006\\/07 with 153 Aboriginal people living in Adelaide, Australia. Participants were asked about their experience of, and responses to, racism, and the impact of these experiences on their health. Racism was regularly experienced by 93% of participants. Almost two thirds of people felt that racism affected their health. Using a thematic analysis with a particular focus on how agency and structure interacted, a number of key reactions and responses to racism were identified. These included: emotional and physiological reactions; and responses such as gaining support from social networks; confronting the person\\/situation; ignoring it; avoiding situations where they might experience racism; 'minimising' the significance or severity of racism or questioning whether incidents were racist; and consuming alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. A further theme was a conscious decision to not 'allow' racism to affect health. Our study found that most people used more than one of these coping strategies, and that strategies were selected with an awareness of positive and negative health impacts. While individuals demonstrated substantial agency in their responses, there were clear structural constraints on how they reacted and responded. We found that not only was racism potentially detrimental to health, but so too were some responses. However, while some strategies appeared 'healthier' than others, most strategies entailed costs and benefits, and these depended on the meanings of responses for individuals. This paper concludes that initiatives to promote health-protective responses to racism need to consider structural constraints and the overarching goal of reducing systemic racism.

This attack came on the heels of months of online abuse from trolls on Twitter, most recently lead by Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos. Through a multiplatform discourse analysis of the Leslie Jones hack, this paper examines the connections between platform vulnerabilities and the vulnerabilities of women, as well as the links between the rise of the alt-right and the mainstreaming of racist, misogynistic trolling behaviors. Building on Whitney Phillips\\u2019s (2015) arguments about the connections between trolling and mainstream culture, this case study maps a moment when these subcultural behaviors were becoming more dominant and provides a microcosm through which to understand the interconnectedness between digital platforms, politics and Politics, race, and gender. Utilizing a qualitative interpretation of Jean Burgess and Ariadna Matamoros-Fern\\u00e1ndez\\u2019s (2016) multiplatform issue mapping, three key themes emerged: messages of support and affirmation; the need for intervention; and the connection between this incident, systemic racism and sexism, and the rise of the alt-right. Overall, the discourse around Leslie Jones\\u2019s hack evinces the mainstreaming of both policy discourse around online harassment and the supposedly subcultural trolling culture that frequently aligns with the alt-right. While other instances of online harassment have garnered significant media attention, the hatred toward Jones surfaced at a cultural and political tipping point, speaking to larger political divides within the United States. celebrity; critical discourse analysis; race; gender; sexuality AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research; 2017: AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research ; 2162-3317 Lawson, Caitlin\"},{\"id\":\"dafd171b76d3b5d172693066f2fe12ec32e24895a4ba31e722555f5fbf01c154\",\"content\":\"A systematic review of empirical research on self-reported racism and health This paper reviews 138 empirical quantitative population-based studies of self-reported racism and health. These studies show an association between self-reported racism and ill health for oppressed racial groups after adjustment for a range of confounders. The strongest and most consistent findings are for negative mental health outcomes and health-related behaviours, with weaker associations existing for positive mental health outcomes, self-assessed health status, and physical health outcomes. Most studies in this emerging field have been published in the past 5 years and have been limited by a dearth of cohort studies, a lack of psychometrically validated exposure instruments, poor conceptualization and definition of racism, conflation of racism with stress, and debate about the aetiologically relevant period for self-reported racism. Future research should examine the psychometric validity of racism instruments and include these instruments, along with objectively measured health outcomes, in existing large-scale survey vehicles as well as longitudinal studies and studies involving children. There is also a need to gain a better understanding of the perception, attribution, and reporting of racism, to investigate the pathways via which self-reported racism affects health, the interplay between mental and physical health outcomes, and exposure to intra-racial, internalized, and systemic racism. Ensuring the quality of studies in this field will allow future research to reveal the complex role that racism plays as a determinant of population health. ; http:\\/\\/ije.oxfordjournals.org\\/content\\/35\\/4\\/888.long Health Equity; Disparities; Mental Health; Health Risk Factors; Stress; Research; Race; ethnic groups; racism; discrimination; review  Paradies, Yin\"},{\"id\":\"0566d0e55f65b5a1384737b06ecb0d94f480783cbc9e63c7de31668420edf2dd\",\"content\":\"A call to healing: Black Lives Matter movement as a framework for addressing the health and wellness of Black women The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement re-centered and illuminated the disparities facing the Black population as a result of systemic racism in the United States (U.S.). Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

Historically, scholarship has focused either on women\\u2019s liberation and feminism, or on civil rights and black liberation.

Rather, my research suggests that their silence was rooted in complex historical and ideological barriers as well as a failure of the mainstream feminist movement to consider their unique history, needs, and circumstances.

This special issue, one of three on this topic area that has been put forth in the history of this journal, comes at a critical point in our world. This is a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is systematically infecting Black, Indigenous, and People of Color and when there has been increased attention to systemic racism and intersecting violence inherent in multiple systems, including the justice, health, and educational systems. Using Kilbourne et al. (2016) framework, this special issue focuses on Phase 2 and Phase 3 research. Rather than only identifying health disparities (Phase 1), this issue focuses on understanding mechanisms and translating such understanding into interventions and policy changes. The accepted articles span a wide gamut from obesity to autism to rural populations. Furthermore, the articles provide methods for advancing the field beyond simply noting that systematic differences exist toward strategies to address these inequities. We conclude this introduction by discussing next steps for future research, with hopes that it inspires the next generation to study issues of disparities and inequity in deeper, more meaningful, and impactful ways.

Discrepancies Between Medical Education and Conception Objective: This preliminary study examined the differences between what was taught during a formal medical education and medical students\\u2019 and psychiatry residents\\u2019 conceptions of notions regarding the causes and determinants of mental illness. Methods: The authors surveyed 74 medical students and 11 residents via convenience sampling. The survey contained 18 statements which were rated twice based on truthfulness in terms of a participant\\u2019s formal education and conception, respectively. Descriptive statistics and a Wilcoxon signed rank test determined differences between education and conception. Results: Results showed that students were less likely to perceive a neurotransmitter imbalance to cause mental illness, as opposed to what was emphasized during a formal medical education. Students and residents also understood the importance of factors such as systemic racism and socioeconomic status in the development of mental illness, which were factors that did not receive heavy emphasis during medical education. Furthermore, students and residents believed that not only did mental illnesses have nonuniform pathologies, but that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders also had the propensity to sometimes arbitrarily categorize individuals with potentially negative consequences. Conclusions: If these notions are therefore part of students\\u2019 and residents\\u2019 conceptions, as well as documented in the literature, then it seems appropriate for medical education to be further developed to emphasize these ideas.

Though some critique disparities through a structural lens, others use deficit discourse, blaming families of color and working-class families for educational outcomes. This study examines how state policy insiders explain educational inequity, shedding light on the complex relationship between language and the maintenance of systemic racism and classism in education. Drawing upon a unique data set of interviews with 50 policy insiders in one state in the United States, we found three main discourses used to explain inequity in education, each of which cited a different cause: 1) structural inequity, 2) perceived deficits of families and communities, and 3) teachers unions and teacher seniority. Policy insiders used often-veiled discursive strategies to advance their discourses. For instance, those that used deficit discourse: 1) asserted that those most negatively impacted by inequity cause inequity; 2) strengthened deficit discourse by blending it with one or both of the other two discourses; and 3) made inequity appear natural through the use of several substrategies, including obscuring the identity of those harmed by inequity. These strategies allowed some policy insiders to strengthen deficit discourse, divert attention from structural issues, and characterize themselves positively while advancing racist and classist ideas.

To evaluate the association between racial residential segregation, a prominent manifestation of systemic racism, and the White-Black survival gap in a contemporary cohort of adults, and to assess the extent to which socioeconomic inequality explains this association.This was a cross sectional study of White and Black men and women aged 35-75 living in 102 large US Core Based Statistical Areas. The main outcome was the White-Black survival gap. We used 2009-2013 CDC mortality data for Black and White men and women to calculate age-, sex- and race adjusted White and Black mortality rates. We measured segregation using the Dissimilarity index, obtained from the Manhattan Institute. We used the 2009-2013 American Community Survey to define indicators of socioeconomic inequality. We estimated the CBSA-level White-Black gap in probability of survival using sequential linear regression models accounting for the CBSA dissimilarity index and race-specific socioeconomic indicators.Black men and women had a 14% and 9% lower probability of survival from age 35 to 75 than their white counterparts. Residential segregation was strongly associated with the survival gap, and this relationship was partly, but not fully, explained by socioeconomic inequality. At the lowest observed level of segregation, and with the Black socioeconomic status (SES) assumed to be at the White SES level scenario, the survival gap is essentially eliminated.White-Black differences in survival remain wide notwithstanding public health efforts to improve life expectancy and initiatives to reduce health disparities. Eliminating racial residential segregation and bringing Black socioeconomic status (SES) to White SES levels would eliminate the White-Black survival gap.

The emergent structure and heterogeneity of the urban landscape drives the biotic outcomes observed, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies effectively consider structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes, instead focusing on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. We explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships binding social inequities, specifically racism, and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices - including residential segregation - to the observed heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. As a result, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors driving biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research.

However, the conceptualization of healthy aging and how age-related issues are addressed in community-based structures, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities, remain poorly understood, especially from the Stakeholder perspective. Stakeholders, such as faith leaders and members of community-based organizations, engage in regular negotiations to advance health equity in their communities by partnering and collaborating with older adults and their families as well as other local and federal organizations. The Stakeholder Engagement in Aging Research and Community Health (SEARCH) Study employs multiple research methods to illuminate Stakeholders\\u2019 perspectives on barriers and facilitators to healthy aging in diverse communities. This presentation highlights findings from in-depth, qualitative interviews with Stakeholders (N=37) serving African American, Latinx, and South Asian older adults. Emergent themes suggest that systemic racism, stigmatization, limited health literacy, and cultural beliefs serve as barriers to healthy aging across groups. Within groups, Stakeholders report precarious immigration status and fragile and fragmented life situations as barriers among Latinx older adults, while acculturative stress presents a challenge to healthy aging in South Asian older adults. Food insecurity and neighborhood factors such as exposure to violence and socio-economic disadvantages act as barriers among African American older adults. Conversely, religious faith and spirituality, familial support, and culturally-congruent care serve as facilitators across groups. The findings from this study underscore the continued need for intersectional, inclusive, and culturally-informed approaches to supporting healthy aging within diverse communities.

It has raised awareness about systemic racism and sexism as well as social and economic conditions experienced by Canada's Indigenous population. Yet, research shows that Indigenous males are the most likely to be murdered in Canada (Mulligan, Axford, & Soecki, 2016). Since Indigenous men are going missing and are murdered in disturbing numbers, and they are fathers, brothers, and sons to Indigenous women and girls, it is understandable that many in the Indigenous community wanted to include them in the inquiry. Our analysis explores how the MMIWG and discourses about inclusion and exclusion have been framed in ways that limit interpretations about the root causes of problems experienced by Indigenous people, especially when they exclude an important part of the Indigenous population Indigenous males. We draw upon Indigenous perceptions of the inquiry and analyses of social norms and stereotypes in order to explore the conflicting positions and experiences associated with missing and murdered Indigenous people in Canada. We conclude by exploring the need for a more comprehensive inquiry. We recognize that a holistic model of inquiry that honours the voices of Indigenous communities is crucial to a proper investigation into missing and murdered Indigenous people in Canada. missing and murdered Indigenous people; justice; social exclusion; Political science; J; Social Sciences; H International Indigenous Policy Journal, Vol 10, Iss 1 (2019) John G.

Perhaps not surprisingly therefore, within such a context, there is a paucity of research on how community development practice engages with issues of race, racialisation, racism and racial inequalities. Little is known about how community development practitioners work with\\/in racially diverse communities or the extent to which Australian community development practice employs a \\u2018race lense\\u2019 in its practice. The discussions in this paper therefore emanate from an understanding that \\u2018colour (race)-blind\\u2019 practice still dominates community development work in Australia. The main contention is that unexamined colour-blind practice has the potential to reproduce systemic racism or systems of racial inequalities. The question informing this paper therefore, is: what is the significance of race in community development practice in Australia? To address this question, the paper centres \\u201cthe experienced reality of lived racism\\u201d (Essed, 1991, p. vii) by black African migrants in Australia - which highlight the pervasiveness of racism in their everyday lives - to argue the need for conversations and considerations about race and inclusion within the field of community development. In the end, the discussions in this paper will raise important questions about the significance of race in community development practice in Australia and the consequences of race-blind practice and colour-mutism when working with\\/in ethnic and racially diverse communities. Perhaps more importantly, the paper contributes to \\u2018courageous conversations\\u2019 about how community development practitioners can work effectively across ethnic and racial boundaries without (re)producing systemic structures of racial inequalities.

To evaluate the association between racial residential segregation, a prominent manifestation of systemic racism, and the White-Black survival gap in a contemporary cohort of adults, and to assess the extent to which socioeconomic inequality explains this association.This was a cross sectional study of White and Black men and women aged 35-75 living in 102 large US Core Based Statistical Areas. The main outcome was the White-Black survival gap. We used 2009-2013 CDC mortality data for Black and White men and women to calculate age-, sex- and race adjusted White and Black mortality rates. We measured segregation using the Dissimilarity index, obtained from the Manhattan Institute. We used the 2009-2013 American Community Survey to define indicators of socioeconomic inequality. We estimated the CBSA-level White-Black gap in probability of survival using sequential linear regression models accounting for the CBSA dissimilarity index and race-specific socioeconomic indicators.Black men and women had a 14% and 9% lower probability of survival from age 35 to 75 than their white counterparts. Residential segregation was strongly associated with the survival gap, and this relationship was partly, but not fully, explained by socioeconomic inequality. At the lowest observed level of segregation, and with the Black socioeconomic status (SES) assumed to be at the White SES level scenario, the survival gap is essentially eliminated.White-Black differences in survival remain wide notwithstanding public health efforts to improve life expectancy and initiatives to reduce health disparities. Eliminating racial residential segregation and bringing Black socioeconomic status (SES) to White SES levels would eliminate the White-Black survival gap.

Although racialized youth account for half of the youth population in Canadian cities like Toronto, their experience in public libraries is an unstudied area of Canadian LIS scholarly and professional research. Existing research approaches youth as a homogenous group in terms of age and biological stages and does not account for race, class, and urbanism. However, racialized youth face different challenges in which race and systemic racism are a facet of everyday life. This workaims to reverse racial neutrality in public libraries by demonstrating how ambivalence about race perpetuates systemic inequalities and the disengagement of racialized youth. It draws on interdisciplinary research to show how the race-blind approach is not reflective of the needs of communities being served. Using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, it shows that public libraries can implement processes to gather race-specific data under the recently-implemented Anti-Racism Act (2017). This will provide a contextual understanding of the racial make-up of users and provide a valuable frame of reference to support efforts to build stronger and more effective relationships. ; Les biblioth\\u00e8ques publiques sont sur la ligne de front pour servir des groupes d\\u00e9favoris\\u00e9s comme les jeunes racialis\\u00e9s et les aider \\u00e0 att\\u00e9nuer les in\\u00e9galit\\u00e9s sociales qui se manifestent par des r\\u00e9sultats n\\u00e9gatifs comme les lacunes en mati\\u00e8re d\\u2019\\u00e9ducation, le sous-emploi et l\\u2019acc\\u00e8s au logement s\\u00fbr et abordable.

Targeted discrimination and intergenerational trauma have undermined the health and wellbeing of Australia\\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, leading to significantly poorer health status, social impoverishment and inequity resulting in the over-representation of Aboriginal people in Australian prisons. Despite adoption of the \\u2018equal treatment\\u2019 principle, on entering prison in Australia entitlements to the national universal healthcare system are revoked and Aboriginal people lose access to health services modelled on Aboriginal concepts of culturally safe healthcare available in the community. Incarcerated Aboriginal women experience poorer health outcomes than incarcerated non-Indigenous women and Aboriginal men, yet little is known about their experiences of accessing healthcare. We report the findings of the largest qualitative study with incarcerated Aboriginal women in New South Wales (NSW) Australia in over 15 years. Methods We employed a decolonizing research methodology, \\u2018community collaborative participatory action research\\u2019, involving consultation with Aboriginal communities prior to the study and establishment of a Project Advisory Group (PAG) of community expert Aboriginal women to guide the project. Forty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2013 with Aboriginal women in urban and regional prisons in NSW. We applied a grounded theory approach for the data analysis with guidance from the PAG. Results Whilst Aboriginal women reported positive and negative experiences of prison healthcare, the custodial system created numerous barriers to accessing healthcare. Aboriginal women experienced institutional racism and discrimination in the form of not being listened to, stereotyping, and inequitable healthcare compared with non-Indigenous women in prison and the community. Conclusions \\u2018Equal treatment\\u2019 is an inappropriate strategy for providing equitable healthcare, which is required because incarcerated Aboriginal women experience significantly poorer health. Taking a decolonizing approach, we unpack and demonstrate the systems level changes needed to make health and justice agencies culturally relevant and safe. This requires further acknowledgment of the oppressive transgenerational effects of ongoing colonial policy, a true embracing of diversity of worldviews, and critically the integration of Aboriginal concepts of health at all organizational levels to uphold Aboriginal women\\u2019s rights to culturally safe healthcare in prison and the community.

Health inequities are unjust differences in health and well-being between and within groups of people caused by socially structured, and thus avoidable, marginalizing conditions such as poverty and systemic racism. In Canada, such conditions disproportionately affect Indigenous persons, racialized newcomers, those with mental health and substance use issues, and those experiencing interpersonal violence. Despite calls to enhance equity in health care to contribute to improving population health, few studies examine how to achieve equity at the point of care, and the impacts of doing so. Many people facing marginalizing conditions experience inadequate and inequitable treatment in emergency departments (EDs), which makes people less likely to access care, paradoxically resulting in reliance on EDs through delays to care and repeat visits, interfering with effective care delivery and increasing human and financial costs. EDs are key settings with potential for mitigating the impacts of structural conditions and barriers to care linked to health inequities. Methods EQUIP is an organizational intervention to promote equity. Building on promising research in primary health care, we are adapting EQUIP to emergency departments, and testing its impact at three geographically and demographically diverse EDs in one Canadian province. A mixed methods multisite design will examine changes in key outcomes including: a) a longitudinal analysis of change over time based on structured assessments of patients and staff, b) an interrupted time series design of administrative data (i.e., staff sick leave, patients who leave without care being completed), c) a process evaluation to assess how the intervention was implemented and the contextual features of the environment and process that are influential for successful implementation, and d) a cost-benefit analysis. Discussion This project will generate both process- and outcome-based evidence to improve the provision of equity-oriented health care in emergency departments, particularly targeting groups known to be at greatest risk for experiencing the negative impacts of health and health care inequities. The main deliverable is a health equity-enhancing framework, including implementable, measurable interventions, tested, refined and relevant to diverse EDs.

A Comment on Wolfgang Seibel\\u2018s Process Tracing Analysis of the NSU investigations (2000-2007)Abstract The article comments on \\u201eCausal Mechanisms of Administrative Failure: A Process Tracing Analysis of the Failure of German Law Enforcement Authorities in the Investigation Into the Serial Killing of Immigrants, 2000-2007\\u201d by Wolfgang Seibel. It is argued that Seibel develops a remarkable own hypothesis which is more convincing than the assumption that the German law enforcement authorities were hampered by systemic racism. Moreover, he plausibly classifies several mistakes and deficiencies of the criminal investigations with the help of an impressive spectrum of theoretical approaches. However, it is criticized that Seibel mainly relies on a single source and disproportionately reduces the complex and lengthy investigations to a few situations. He insufficiently explains his selection and application of causal mechanisms. Furthermore, his inferences seem to be biased due to several normative premises. Seibel\\u2019s conclusions do not necessarily and exhaustively explain the failure of the criminal investigations. Finally, the text provides some suggestions to improve future qualitative studies that deal with cases of administrative failure. Particularly the perils of equifinality, censoring, selection bias, and the ex post perspective should be taken into account.

In addition, I challenge students to examine their own biases and stereotypes that influence the ways in which they interact with others (Conle, 2000; Finney & Orr, 1995). The essence of this exercise is to counteract impasses that may arise and create a polarization of ideas. At the outset, I share my belief that I consider instances of conflict or tension within my classroom as moments of potential learning. I also emphasize the complexity of the issues involved, for instance, the course reinforces that there are no easy solutions to practical educational issues. Consequently, I make students aware that rather than offering a \\\"how to list,\\\" the course introduces them to different ways of seeing the world. In this way, I urge students to think critically about education as a social and political institutional tool. At the outset, we need to acknowledge that most of our student teachers are isolated from a significant portion of the population they are likely to teach. In fact, they will likely have little or no knowledge of the variety and strengths of people outside their communities. Such lack of familiarity will result in many teacher candidates relying on stereotypical, homogenizing understandings of racial and cultural groups. Assumptions that Aboriginals are alcoholics, for example or that Blacks are criminals, which are justified by the rhetoric that \\\"they have chosen to live that way.\\\" Such uninformed thinking demonstrates a lack of appreciation for structural issues, which affect the way in which society operates. More specifically, these belief systems fail to acknowledge that society does not provide equal opportunities for all its members. Ignoring these realities, students from middle class backgrounds feel justified in asserting that \\\"These people need to work harder--I have always struggled to better myself.\\\" And hence the myth of a meritocratic society is perpetuated. This biased thinking also obscures the fact that power and privilege are accorded only to select groups, based on social markers such as gender, class, race, sexual orientation and able-bodiedness. Further, many students forget the historical trauma, the legacies of colonialism, slavery and contemporary consequences within which many non-white populations find themselves saddled. There are several barriers that could make introduction of an anti-racist pedagogy difficult: unconscious and institutional racism, systemic racism and stereotypes. Unconscious racism is deeply embedded in an individual's personal belief system and may interfere with an individual's ability to accept more inclusive ways of teaching. We must recognize that knowledge is socially constructed and mediated by sociocultural, historical and institutional contexts. In my view, a school curriculum must present students with socially relevant and challenging new knowledge so that they, in collaboration with their teachers, can engage in a meaningful dialogue and become more informed members of their communities.

Thus, it is important to articulate how cultural safety can be enacted to support rural Indigenous Peoples and communities at end of life. We sought to identify strategies described in existing literature that have potential to deepen our understanding of culturally safe approaches to palliative care within rural and small-town settings in Canada. Methods We searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature about Indigenous palliative care in rural and small-town settings in Canada, United States, New Zealand, and Australia. Medline, CINAHL, and Embase were searched. We thematically analyzed 22 resulting articles to address our interest in culturally safe approaches to palliative care in rural\\/small-town and on-reserve contexts. Results The following themes were extracted from the literature: symbolic or small gestures; anticipating barriers to care; defer to client, family and community; shared decision-Making; active patient and family involvement; respectful, clear, and culturally appropriate communication; community ownership of services; empower cultural identity, knowledge, and traditions; and, policy. Discussion Culturally competent practices can improve Indigenous palliative care services; however, they do not result in decolonized care. Strategies include: symbolic or small gestures; anticipating barriers to access; deferring to the client, family, and community members; and, collective decision making and family involvement. Culturally safe approaches contribute to institutional or organizational change and decolonized care. Strategies include: involvement of patient and family in service planning; reflection about individual and systemic racism; community ownership of services and; recognizing distinct Worldviews that shape care. Conclusions Culturally safe strategies invite decolonization of care through awareness of colonialism, racism, and discrimination. They invite commitment to building partnerships, power sharing, and decision-making in the delivery of care. Culturally competent activities may catalyze the adoption of a cultural safety framework; however, mislabeling of cultural competency as cultural safety may contribute to organizational inaction and a watering down of the spirit of cultural safety.

This study examined cultural awareness training feedback from healthcare professionals working with high Aboriginal patient caseloads in the Top End of the Northern Territory of Australia. The aim of the research was to assess the perception of training and the potential for expansion to better meet workforce needs. Methods Audit and qualitative thematic analysis of cultural awareness training evaluation forms completed by course participants between March and October 2018. Course participants ranked seven teaching domains using five-point Likert scales (maximum summary score 35 points) and provided free-text feedback. Data were analysed using the Framework Method and assessed against Kirkpatrick\\u2019s training evaluation model. Cultural safety and decolonising philosophies shaped the approach. Results 621 participants attended 27 ACAP sessions during the study period. Evaluation forms were completed by 596 (96%). The mean overall assessment score provided was 34\\/35 points (standard deviation 1.0, range 31-35) indicating high levels of participant satisfaction. Analysis of 683 free text comments found participants wanted more cultural education, designed and delivered by local people, which provides an opportunity to consciously explore both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal cultures (including self-reflection). Regarding the expansion of cultural education, four major areas requiring specific attention were identified: communication, kinship, history and professional relevance. A strength of this training was the authentic personal stories shared by local Aboriginal cultural educators, reflecting community experiences and attitudes. Criticism of the current model included that too much information was delivered in one day. Conclusions Healthcare providers found cultural awareness training to be an invaluable entry point. Cultural education which elevates the Aboriginal health user\\u2019s experience and provides health professionals with an opportunity for critical self-reflection and practical solutions for common cross-cultural clinical encounters may improve the delivery of culturally safe care. We conclude that revised models of cultural education should be developed, tested and evaluated. This requires institutional support, and recognition that cultural education can contribute to addressing systemic racism.

In contrast to such perspectives, it proposes a conceptualisation of these cultural groups as structural social groups, and their construction will therefore be explained as arising from a similar position on social axes of disadvantage, through structural social processes of inequality, such as systemic racism, the division of labour, or the process of normalization. Finally, a gender perspective is included in order to explain relational processes of the social structure generated specifically by motives of gender which, nonetheless, tend to be rendered invisible not only in theoretical debates, but also in political discussions concerning immigrant inclusion policies.

Health inequities are unjust differences in health and well-being between and within groups of people caused by socially structured, and thus avoidable, marginalizing conditions such as poverty and systemic racism. In Canada, such conditions disproportionately affect Indigenous persons, racialized newcomers, those with mental health and substance use issues, and those experiencing interpersonal violence. Despite calls to enhance equity in health care to contribute to improving population health, few studies examine how to achieve equity at the point of care, and the impacts of doing so. Many people facing marginalizing conditions experience inadequate and inequitable treatment in emergency departments (EDs), which makes people less likely to access care, paradoxically resulting in reliance on EDs through delays to care and repeat visits, interfering with effective care delivery and increasing human and financial costs. EDs are key settings with potential for mitigating the impacts of structural conditions and barriers to care linked to health inequities. Methods: EQUIP is an organizational intervention to promote equity. Building on promising research in primary health care, we are adapting EQUIP to emergency departments, and testing its impact at three geographically and demographically diverse EDs in one Canadian province. A mixed methods multisite design will examine changes in key outcomes including: a) a longitudinal analysis of change over time based on structured assessments of patients and staff, b) an interrupted time series design of administrative data (i.e., staff sick leave, patients who leave without care being completed), c) a process evaluation to assess how the intervention was implemented and the contextual features of the environment and process that are influential for successful implementation, and d) a cost-benefit analysis. Discussion: This project will generate both process- and outcome-based evidence to improve the provision of equity-oriented health care in emergency departments, particularly targeting groups known to be at greatest risk for experiencing the negative impacts of health and health care inequities. The main deliverable is a health equity-enhancing framework, including implementable, measurable interventions, tested, refined and relevant to diverse EDs.

Racism is a belief that some groups are superior while some other groups are inferior. Discrimination is the unequal or unfair and violence actions toward others, basically based on their race, skin color and belief. Rebellion is an action or a movement against the pressures which comes from the outside. Those three issues can be found in the movies Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The purposes of this study are to identify and analyze the kinds of racism action from Humans which then emerged the resistance or rebellion from the Apes, and how do the Apes rebel to the Humans. The primary data of this study were collected from Mat Reeves\\u2019s Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) movies. The theory of racism by Henry and Tator, discrimination theories by Theodorson and Theodorson and Larry Willmore and theory of rebellion by Karl Marx and D. E. H. Russel were used as the theoretical framework to find out and analyzed the kinds of racism that the Humans had done to the Apes and the way the Apes do the rebellion action in the movies Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes movies. The result of this study showed that the rebellion action from Apes toward Humans is appropriated with the rebellion theories from Karl Marx and D. E. H. Russel. The Apes did the rebellion actions toward the Humans because of the unfair treatments, racism and discrimination treatments from the Humans. Furthermore, the result of Ape\\u2019s rebellion towards Human in the movies is only the destruction. Key words: individual racism, interpersonal racism, systemic racism, institutional racism, discrimination. ABSTRAK Rasisme, diskriminasi dan pemberontakan adalah tiga persoalan yang masih eksis didunia sampai saat ini. Rasisme adalah sebuah paham bahwa ada sebagian kelompok yang unggul dan sebagian tidak. Diskriminasi adalah perlakuan yang tidak adil atau pembedaan perlakuan dan kekerasan terhadap orang lain, biasanya berdasarkan ras, warna kulit dan kepercayaan. Pemberontakan adalah sebuah tindakan atau sebuah pergerakan melawan ancaman yang datang dari luar. Ketiga persoalan tersebut dapat dijumpai didalam film Rise of the Planet of the Apes dan Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Adapun tujuan dari studi ini adalah untuk menidentifikasi dan menganalisa jenis-jenis tindakan rasismme yang dilakukan oleh kelompok manusia yang menyebabkan terjadinya perlawanan atau pemberontakan dari kelompok kera dan bagaimana cara kelompok kera memberontak kepada kelompok manusia. Data utama dari studi ini diambil dari karyanya Matt Reeves, yaitu film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) dan Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). Adapun teori rasisme menggunakan teori dari Henry and Tator, teori diskriminasi dari Theodorson and Theodorsondan Larry Willmore dan teori pemberontakan dari Karl Marx dan D. E. H. Russel. Teori-teori tersebut merupakan teori utama yang digunakan untuk menganalisa macam-macam rasisme yang dilakukan oleh kelompok manusia terhadap kelompok kera, dan bentuk atau cara dari aksi pemberontakan yang dilakukan oleh kelompok kera didalam film Rise of the Planet of the Apes dan Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Hasil yang didapatkan dari studi ini menunjukkan bahwa aksi pemberontakan yang dilakukan oleh kelompok kera selaras dengan teori dari Karl Marx dan D. E. H. Russel. Kelompok kera melakukan aksi pemberontakan karena perlakuan yang tidak adil, tindakan diskriminasi dan rasisme dari kelompok manusia. Ironisnya, hasil dari pada aksi pemberontakan yang dilakukan kelompok kera terhadap kelompok manusia hanyalah mendatangkan kehancuran.

He urges the reader to confront the critical tendencies that have sidelined comprehensive analysis of black British art, and move beyond narratives that approach the creative production of black artists instrumentally, as a lens through which, at best, to examine (and, at worst, explain) the social and political implications of race and ethnicity in twentieth century Britain. Echoing Mercer\\u2019s assessment, recent publications by scholars such as Leon Wainwright and, from an American perspective, Darby English have highlighted the ways in which this problematic halfstory has been written both by racism\\u2019s \\u201cinventive way of isolating black realities from the spaces whose purity it would conserve by doing so\\u201d and also \\u2013 notably \\u2013 even by some countermeasures against this systemic racism. Returning to British shores, to these two factors we might also add the dominance of voices from the fields of sociology and cultural theory, not least in important foundational works by Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, in the establishment of early scholarship around \\u201cblack art\\u201d and black British artists. Arguing for a loosely reconfigured version of Erwin Panofsky\\u2019s iconographic model, Mercer offers one possibility for object-based engagement. More recently, English, Wainwright and others have looked to frameworks of materiality and phenomenology (respectively), to de-center narratives of racial and ethnic identity in art historical assessments of works by black and diaspora artists. But, of course, these critiques are not new, nor is the stilted discourse that they observe. They join the voices of Rasheed Araeen, Sonia Boyce, Lubaina Himid, Eddie Chambers, Keith Piper, Veronica Ryan, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, Marlene Smith, and others, a chorus gathering force since the late 1970s, when the constellation of artists, activists, and critics of what has come to be known, in some circles, as the Black Arts Movement burst on the British art scene. Working in relation to questions of \\u201cblackness\\u201d in Britain and the possibilities and implications of a black British art through visual practice and in art-adjacent practices as artist-curators, artist-critics, artist-researchers and artist-archivists, though somewhat imprecise and contested, the Black Arts Movement laid the foundations for the radical art history that lies at the root of Mercer\\u2019s challenge: an art history that accounts for the work of black British artists within the context of wider national and international aesthetic, cultural and historical formations, rather than footnotes haphazardly inserted into mainstream narratives of art in the twentieth century, if they (black British artists) are included at all. This article springs from the interstices of a pair of projects\\u2014one that is wrapping up, and the other starting out\\u2014which continue the work of excavating this art history, building on a rapidly growing literature around the Black Arts Movement in Britain by tracing its roots from the early 1960s. Following the contours of the first two of what Stuart Hall has called \\u201cwaves\\u201d of black arts activity in postwar Britain, this article takes as a starting point a critical examination of the notion of \\u201cblack art\\u201d in a British context in order to unravel attendant questions around the formation and framing of what has come to be generally known as a Black Arts Movement. This mode of engagement with the creative products of black British artists must address, as Mercer notes, \\u201cthe necessity of interpreting the work as a document of the human imagination that exists as an object of aesthetic attention in its own right.\\u201d This is not to say, however, that we should, or even can, disavow the politics of identity or politics more broadly. Indeed, much of the work created during the broad period from the early 1960s is overtly concerned with the radical possibilities made available by the construction and interrogation of identities that are variously and simultaneously defined by race, gender, class, and sexuality. To disentangle aesthetics and politics entirely in these cases would be futile and tell a different, but still problematic, half-story. Rather, building on and supplementing the work that has been done in this field by earlier historians and critics working within identity-based frameworks, this article, and the projects from which it arises, aim to create a more comprehensive understanding of artworks that at times deal explicitly, though not exclusively, with identity, together with wider questions of politics, aesthetics, and the construction of art\\u2019s histories.
