A Delphi Approach\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose \\u2013 Using the Delphi technique, this paper aims to investigate how human resource experts perceive service robots will impact leadership and human resource management in the hospitality industry. Design\\/methodology\\/approach \\u2013 A three-stage Delphi study with hotel industry human resource experts was conducted to identify the key trends and major challenges that will emerge in the next ten years and how leaders should deal with the challenges brought about by service robot technologies. Findings \\u2013 Results show that while service robots are anticipated to increase efficiency and productivity of hotel activities, they may also pose challenges such as high costs, skill deficits, and significant changes to the organizational structure and culture of hotels. Therefore, the anticipated applications and integration of robotic technology will require leaders of the future to carefully consider the balance between the roles of service robots and human employees in the guest experience, and to nurture a work environment that embraces open-mindedness and change. Originality\\/value \\u2013 This is the first type of study to examine hospitality leadership and human resource management in the context of robotized hotels. This study has taken an important step to understand the leadership role in robotized hotels from a human resource perspective, and brings clarity as to how robotic technology can influence leadership in the future workplace.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-03-04\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Xu, Tracy; Steinmetz, J.; Ashton, M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/epubs.surrey.ac.uk\\/853873\\/1\\/IJCHM%20Leadership%20and%20Robot%204th%20RR%20final.docx\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"3ba00b582b9c16cf9ed19913d3f4f4d54b5633c907d969a17a7b2a71039e28d1\",\"relevance\":120},{\"id\":\"3c7eed05becaa727b48537c2fa879010f783fe14c7f3d3ac7b700b71c61f185d\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/inzeko.ktu.lt\\/index.php\\/EE\\/article\\/view\\/24045; Inzinerine Ekonomika-Engineering Economics; http:\\/\\/publikace.k.utb.cz\\/handle\\/10563\\/1009621\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/publikace.k.utb.cz\\/handle\\/10563\\/1009621\",\"title\":\"Sustainability and economic performance: role of organizational learning and innovation\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The purpose of the current study is to examine the mediating role of organizational learning on a firm\\u2019s capabilities, corporate governance, leadership styles, and the firm\\u2019s sustainability. Moreover, the innovative culture used as a moderating variable between organizational learning and the firm\\u2019s sustainability. Data were collected from manufacturing organizations operating in Malaysia. This study used simple random sampling technique in data collection. Cross-sectional design and correlational design were used in meeting the objectives of the research. There were 550 questionnaires distributed among respondents,and only 382 questionnaires were returned back, 15 questionnaires were excluded from the 382 questionnaires because of misleading and missing values. Hence, in the final analysis, only 367 questionnaires were used. Findings reveal that organizational capabilities and corporate governance significantly enhance both organizational learning and a firm\\u2019s sustainability. Moreover, leadership styles significantly enhance organizational learning but have no influence on a firm\\u2019s sustainability. Organizational learning significantly mediates between organizational capabilities, corporate governance, leadership styles, and the firm\\u2019s sustainability. Organizational learning also has a significant influence on the firm\\u2019s sustainability. Finally, innovative culture significantly moderates between organizational learning and the firm\\u2019s sustainability. The practical contribution of this research is that the top management can focus on these indicators in measuring firm\\u2019s sustainability. \\u00a9 2020, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Old definitions had to bring new persuasion into the field in order to compete among modern organizations. We can witness those changes firstly by analyzing how the meaning of an organizational culture has been changed over the previous decades from a very narrow function to a wide and meaningful definition including soft skills and psychological aspects. The most common reason why it happened is economic and technological growth and changes in demand which come along with it. Organizations must adapt to those changes; otherwise, consequences can be crucial. Organizational culture nowadays includes more supporting disciplines, and one of them is Human Resources Management (HRM). Organizational culture and Human Resources Management have been merged as supporting disciplines approximately in the late nineties. The meaning of that phenomena got even stronger when American psychologists admitted its relevance and supported the idea that organizational culture consists not only of an external context. HRM\\u2019s components, such as employee\\u2019s engagement, the management of cultural differences among parties, creative leadership, the identification of a specific and individual needs, etc., became relevant in shaping organizational culture in a modern organization. The article presents components which belong to the side of organizational culture as well as to the side of HRM and the most important relations between two disciplines and common components which glued those disciplines together. ; Organizacin\\u0117s kult\\u016bros vaidmuo per pastaruosius de\\u0161imtme\\u010dius i\\u0161augo kartu su darbo rinkos poky\\u010diais.

For a full-fledged, stable functioning of any political party, there is a need of the continuous link between its structural elements and society. Such connection can be done with the help of mass media, holding party congresses and forums, also we don\\u2019t need to forget about the common communication with voters, so-called \\u00abdoor-to-door\\u00bb communication. Actually, the last type of activity is usually conducted before and during the election campaign. And in order to maintain contact with voters regardless of the period of election campaigns, the political party creates an instrument that will function day after day, year after year. Therefore, special attention should be focused on the process of communication between the political party and the citizens through the institution of public reception centers. The political party\\u2019s main line, the direction of its progress and development are determined not only by the own aims of the political party\\u2019s leadership, but also by complicated problems in many spheres of society that need to be solved. In order to identify these problems, it is necessary to carry out explanatory work, to communicate with people, to support them, to do everything possible to solve issues at the local and state levels. Therefore, researches of the institution of public reception centers of political parties is very relevant and progressive, according to the dynamic nature of socio-political process development, the active participation of citizens in the information and communicative spaces and the political life of the state as a whole. The purpose of the research is to review the main theoretical aspects of the concept of \\u00abpublic reception centers\\u00bb in political parties, to analyze the main subjects of this communicative process, to identify the main directions of the institution of public reception centers work in political parties, to offer practical recommendations for improving the work of the institution of public reception centers in political parties. Methodology. In the course of research, the author is used such scientific methods as: observation, comparison, analysis, induction and deduction, modeling, as well as systemic and structural-activity approaches. Conclusions. The functioning of public reception centers of political parties is a promising direction of the activity of any political force. This is one of the most effective channels of political communication, which operates on an ongoing basis, even during the inter-election period. The employees of public reception centers not only cover the party\\u2019s activities, provide comments and explanations about the deputies\\u2019 work, but also deal with legal aid. Many parties with a clear organizational structure separate the public reception centers as special institution or department. So, direct real communication with the citizens is highly appreciated in the communicative process between the party and society, because this way is made possible to hear the most acute and painful problems, get valuable advices and perspective recommendations for building a strategy of political activity. Results of work. The author proposes to supplement the provisions on the work of the public reception centers with the following practical recommendations: 1) it is necessary to ensure the presence of a signboard on the reception centers, inside it is necessary to hang a party flag, certain information about the activities, achievements of deputies and ordinary members of the party, propaganda products; 2) to prepare and agree the working hours of the reception center, the hours of reception of deputies of local government establishments and deputies of Ukraine; 3) to inform the mass media and social networks about the location and procedure of work in reception centers; 4) it is necessary to choose employees for the work with citizens, preferably with legal education, because many issues have a legal direction; 5) to provide employees with high-quality office equipment and communications (landline telephone, mobile communication, Internet communication); 6) to involve actively local, state government establishments, as well as entrepreneurial structures, public, youth, charitable organizations, investors, social services to solve the problems of citizens promptly; 7) to conduct training seminars for public reception centers staff with the participation of professionals in the field of communication with people and psychologists, because the work with strange citizens requires a great moral and intellectual exclusion and tolerance. ;

Fust changes in the environment require further research into the effectiveness of the application of existing agile methodologies, knowledge systems and competencies of project managers and their leadership. The foundations of environmental change lie in changing the decision-making paradigm in agile project and programs management. The article explores modern approaches to leadership formation when applying agile methodologies of its specificity from decision-making processes in project management. The problems of leadership creation and development in the application of agile project management methodologies for the implementation of Agile transformation of organisation are considered. The studies were conducted based on a competency-based approach modelled by the International Project Management Association. The content model of competency of the leader applying agile management is presented. The Agile leadership and leadership behaviour patterns are formed in a project management behavioural competency system based on agile technology methods and tools. These competencies included: Self-reflection and self-management, Personal integrity and reliability, Personal communication, Relationships and interaction, Leadership, Teamwork, Conflicts and Crises, Resourcefulness, Negotiation, and Orientation to results. The patterns of project managers' behaviour as agile leaders in project product creation and agile project management are explored. The differences in the behaviour patterns of leaders and agile leaders were examined by behavioural competencies within the identified key competency indicators. Such patterns allowed the authors to identify bottlenecks in the application of agile project management methodologies in the context of the development for Agile transformation of organization. ;

To address this issue, one of the directions is to seek new forms and ways of developing international military cooperation. Based on the analysis of modern scientific literature and source base, the author has studied the prerequisites for the establishment of military cooperation between Ukraine, Poland and the Republic of Lithuania by the example of the formation of a multilateral military unit LITPOLUKRBRIG. The author pays special attention to the participation of the unit Armed Forces of Ukraine in joint activities with the armed forces of NATO member states to acquire interoperability to perform task for their intended purpose.It has been proved that the leading condition for the creation of the LITPOLUKRBRIG military unit was common interest of the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Poland and Ukraine in the field of ensuring international peace and security in Europe. At the same time, the conceptual approaches to establishing a joint peacekeeping military unit have changed depending on the activity of the military and political leadership of the states and their readiness to participate in ensuring international peace and security in the region and the world.The conducted study allows asserting that exchange of experience, obtaining of new theoretical and practical skills according to NATO standards during joint trainings (exercises), performance of peacekeeping (special) tasks promoted acquisition of abilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to joint action.At the same time, the authors periodization of the evolution of the conceptual fundamentals for the formation of a multilateral military unit LITPOLUKRBRIG was proposed and the prerequisites for each stage were described: the first stage (1992-1997); the second stage (November 1997-2009); the third stage (November 2009-2015).

Therefore, there is a need for scientific generalization of the indicated experience in the use of troops (forces) during the preparation and conduct of evacuation activities by sea and the development of naval art, as a theoretical basis for solving scientific and practical problemsThe purpose of the proposed article is to disclose and generalize the experience of preparing and conducting the evacuation of troops (forces) of the \\u201cwhite\\u201d movement and the civilian population from Odessa in February 1920 to use it in the process of improving the theory and practice of the activities of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.The paper analyzes and explores the main causes and factors that directly affected the preparation and conduct of the Odessa evacuation of troops (forces) of the \\\"white\\\" movement and the civilian population by the sea in February 1920 and, as a result, affected its final results.The author focuses on the dependence of the results of the Odessa evacuation by sea in February 1920 on such factors as: the views of the leadership of the naval forces on the preparation and use of their forces; preparedness of the military command and control bodies, available fleet forces (including civilian forces) and the region to carry out evacuation tasks by sea; military-geographical conditions for the operation of naval forces, including the state and development of the equipment of the theater of operations; the composition and balance of power of the parties and the nature of the action of enemy forces. The paper highlights and describes the characteristic features of the preparation and conduct of evacuation measures, evaluates the results of their imple- mentation. ; \\u0423

aim of this paper is to determine the place and role of the court Masque of the Kings of the house of Stuart era in the political life of England in the first half of the 17th century, as well as to identify the level of influence of the court Masque on the values and priorities of the royal court, as well as the effect on strengthening the authority of the monarch.Research methodology. Twelve publications by leading English scholars on this subject were considered, including archival data and historical choirs. The materials of the specific literature were studied using logical, historical, chronological, problem-chronological and historical-retrospective methods.Results. The Court Masque became a model of the Renaissance culture, in which politics, aesthetics, culture, and history closely interacted.Masques were designed to emphasize the harmony, unity, and consolidation of English society. Thanks to the huge influence of the Masques on the political and cultural life of England, the Palace of Whitehall gradually turned into a world center of influence. Masques become a cult example of the Stuart era. The Court Masque becomes an intermediary between the crown and the court, a channel of communication between the monarch and his elites, performing auxiliary functions in maintaining the power of the Stuarts. Masques strengthened the authority of the King of England in the political arena and asserted his right to national leadership. The Masques sublimated the conflict into aesthetic harmony and submission to the will of the monarch, demonstrating the strengths of the royal Stuart house.Novelty. An attempt is made to analyze the works of leading researchers of the Renaissance, in order to identify the influence of the court Masque on the political culture of England.The practical significance. The key results of this research can be used in lecture materials, practical classes and seminars on the history of foreign culture. ; \\u0412\\u0438\\u0432\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u043e \\u0442\\u0430

The significance and conceptual provisions of pedagogical conditions for the formation of leadership qualities in students of economic universities are determined.A system of pedagogical conditions for the formation of leadership qualities among students of economic universities is singled out. The first pedagogical condition for the formation of leadership qualities among students of economic universities is the creation of an open educational environment for an economic university, which allows building an individual educational trajectory for each student and taking into account the specifics of the professional activity of a future specialist. The second pedagogical condition for the formation of leadership qualities among students of economic universities is the creation of a developing personality-oriented environment in the educational and extra-curricular interaction of students. Its technological arsenal includes methods and techniques that meet such requirements as: dialogicity; activity-creative character; orientation in support of individual development of the individual; providing the student with the necessary space, freedom to make independent decisions, creativity, choice of content and ways of doing things.The emphasis is on the development of a leadership paradigm through the organization of training work. The third pedagogical condition for the formation of leadership skills among students of economic universities is the introduction of a leadership paradigm through the organization of interactive forms of work (trainings) at the School of the Leader. It is described that the program of modular discipline \\\"Fundamentals of Leadership\\\" has been developed. \\\"Personal and professional efficiency. A series of trainings on leadership development for students of economic universities \\\"contains interactive group and individual tasks for obtaining, developing and improving personal leadership qualities. The purpose, tasks and principles of the implementation of a complex of trainings on the development of leadership qualities in the students of economic universities have been determined. Trainings on development of leadership qualities at students of economic universities \\\"Personal and professional efficiency\\\" are distributed by modules. The content, types and direction of training exercises of each module are described.It is emphasized that taking these principles into account allows each student to feel unique personality, to acquire the necessary leadership skills that will help him in communicating, co-operating, and self-development. ;

Sokolianskyi in the field of the domestic system of education development in the 20\\u201330\\u2019s of the XXth century in Ukraine in the context of realizing the goals of the social education concept. Particular attention is paid to the research in the field of general pedagogy, pedology, reflexology, their role and meaning in working with children with special needs.It is proved that I. Sokolianskyi is the founder of domestic studies in the field of special pedagogy, in particular, surdo-pedagogy and tiflopedagogy (blindness and education), which in the present conditions have not lost their relevance and are the subject of scientific research in the implementation of the tasks of inclusive education.The research confirmed that he developed methods that have helped to attract blind children to active life. First of all, it is the design of a reading machine for such children, and the device is used today to work with people with such visual impairments. In general, his scientific and experimental work contributed to the substantiation and implementation of the education system for children with visual impairments of different types.Being engaged in practical work, carrying out serious scientific research and covering them in scientific researches, the scientist has convincingly proved the importance and meaning of general pedagogy, reflexology, defectology in working with children, especially children with certain physical defects.Filling special pedagogy with new theoretical knowledge, he developed a methodology for working with children with special needs, its developments in the field of defectology today are extremely important, relevant and require a new assessment and implementation in the current conditions, in particular the concept of creating an inclusive pedagogical environment in the modern educational system of Ukraine. At the forefront of the article are the issues of I. Sokolianskyi involvement in the implementation of social education tasks, in particular, at the level of solving problems of \\u201cdefective\\u201d childhood. Being responsible for this important area of work, he has done a great deal to create a kindergarten system for children with visual and hearing impairments. Under his leadership, the statutes and regulations of orphanages for different categories of children were developed; great attention was paid to the training of teaching staff; the medical and pedagogical component of the educational process was provided. The scientist was engaged not only in organizational and management work, but also directly provided medical and psychological assistance to children and their parents, working in the field of tiffotechnics. On his initiative, a specialized clinic was opened at the Kharkiv Institute of Defectology for the blindly deaf children, where a scientifically sound and practically proven method of teaching children with such disabilities was created. The publication proves that I. Sokolianskyi was the organizer, theorist and practitioner of the social education system of Ukraine in the 1920\\u201330s, and left behind a great scientific and pedagogical heritage, which is still relevant today.\",\"published_in\":\"Problems of Modern Teacher Training; \\u2116 21 (2020): ; 30-38 ; \\u041f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0431\\u043b\\u0435\\u043c\\u0438 \\u043f\\u0456\\u0434\\u0433\\u043e\\u0442\\u043e\\u0432\\u043a\\u0438 \\u0441\\u0443\\u0447\\u0430\\u0441\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0432\\u0447\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044f; \\u2116 21 (2020): \\u0427\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438\\u043d\\u0430 1; 30-38 ; 2307-4914\",\"year\":\"2020-02-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u041e\\u0441\\u0432\\u0456\\u0442\\u0430; \\u0421\\u043e\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u0435 \\u0432\\u0438\\u0445\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f; \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u0435 \\u0441\\u0435\\u0440\\u0435\\u0434\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0449\\u0435; \\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u044f\\u0447\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0440\\u0443\\u0445; \\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u0430 \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u043a\\u0430; \\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u044f\\u0447\\u0456 \\u0437\\u0430\\u043a\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434\\u0438 \\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0442\\u0438\\u043f\\u0443; \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u0435 \\u0456\\u043d\\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0443\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f; \\u00ab\\u0434\\u0435\\u0444\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u0435\\u00bb \\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u043e; \\u043f\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e \\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u044f\\u0447\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0437\\u0430\\u043a\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434; Social education; pedagogical environment; children\\u2019s movement; special pedagogy; kindergartens of special type; pedagogical inspection; \\u201cdefective\\u201d childhood; regulations on children institution\",\"subject\":\"\\u041e\\u0441\\u0432\\u0456\\u0442\\u0430; \\u0421\\u043e\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u0435 \\u0432\\u0438\\u0445\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f; \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u0435 \\u0441\\u0435\\u0440\\u0435\\u0434\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0449\\u0435; \\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u044f\\u0447\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0440\\u0443\\u0445; \\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u0430 \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u043a\\u0430; \\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u044f\\u0447\\u0456 \\u0437\\u0430\\u043a\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434\\u0438 \\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0442\\u0438\\u043f\\u0443; \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u0435 \\u0456\\u043d\\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0443\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f; \\u00ab\\u0434\\u0435\\u0444\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u0435\\u00bb \\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u043e; \\u043f\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e \\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u044f\\u0447\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0437\\u0430\\u043a\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434; Social education; pedagogical environment; children\\u2019s movement; special pedagogy; kindergartens of special type; pedagogical inspection; \\u201cdefective\\u201d childhood; regulations on children institution\",\"authors\":\"\\u0411\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e\\u043c\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430, \\u041c\\u0430\\u0440\\u0438\\u043d\\u0430\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/psv.udpu.edu.ua\\/article\\/view\\/205376\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"05cc18bfd056cfd979b80b3bc126cd198ade8660c66d5a76c539cee152680f82\",\"relevance\":109},{\"id\":\"926d660151f9d0baaa84e5935e1e5b2c5c558189e99597e0db16a429d1894ba5\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/oapub.org\\/soc\\/index.php\\/EJSSS\\/article\\/view\\/776\\/1358; https:\\/\\/oapub.org\\/soc\\/index.php\\/EJSSS\\/article\\/view\\/776\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/oapub.org\\/soc\\/index.php\\/EJSSS\\/article\\/view\\/776\",\"title\":\"CONSTRUCTING LEADERS\\u2019 BEHAVIOUR AND SITUATIONAL FACTORS TOWARD ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE AT ABU DHABI NATIONAL OIL COMPANY (ADNOC) IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE)\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The need for effective leadership has remained critical to capacity building and sustenance of competitive advantage in both public and private businesses. Nonetheless, leadership effectiveness has remained a multi-dimensional construct, and not many attempts have been made to conceptualise models in this area. Considering the case of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), the principal aim of the present study was to update and empirically support the traditional Contingency Model of Leadership Effectiveness in order to achieve a more credible model useful to contemporary organisations. It was observed that leader characteristics and hierarchy structure are not good determinants of leadership behaviour in the organisation. A final attempt was made to validate the Contingency Model of Leadership Effectiveness with the help of data gathered in the present study. Data validates the traditional model of leadership to a large extent; this is especially true for task-oriented leadership behaviour as opposed to relationship-oriented leadership behaviour. It is recommended that future researchers consider activity-based constructs for the measurement of variables to obtain more significant and validate critical relationships in the model. It is also recommended that ADNOC and other corporations in the region give equal attention to male and female employees and leaders. Females would particularly strive in positions where leader-subordinate relationships are critical for overall organisational success.

Design: A qualitative study using critical incident technique and a content analytic approach of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Setting: Maternity wards in 10 Norwegian hospitals with more than 200 registered births annually were included in the study. Participants: A purposeful sample of 33 midwives with more than two years\\u2019 working experience described 57 adverse incidents. Findings: Maternity ward managers utilised four types of practices to support midwives after critical incidents: management, transformational leadership, distributed leadership and laissez-faire leadership. Key conclusions and implications for practice: The study shows that proactive managers who planned for how to handle critical incidents provided midwives with needed individual support and learning. Proactive transformational leadership and delegating roles for individual support should be promoted when assisting second victims after critical incidents. Managers can limit the potential harm to second victims by preparing for the eventuality of a crisis and institute follow-up practices. ; This work was supported by grants from Telemark Hospital Trust and Norwegian midwife and Nurses Association. ; publishedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"0266-6138 ; 1532-3099\",\"year\":\"2020-03-02T10:19:13Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Adverse incidents; Midwives; Second victims; Critical incident stress debriefing; Follow-up practices; Front line management\",\"subject\":\"Adverse incidents; Midwives; Second victims; Critical incident stress debriefing; Follow-up practices; Front line management\",\"authors\":\"R\\u00f8nningstad, Chris; Christoffersen, Line; Teigen, Janne\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10642\\/8224\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"bbcdc3ef15abaf17e2a27bf71aa26137aa43bda98a6ab2721c1e96cbaa020127\",\"relevance\":105},{\"id\":\"5ad5a8d51021f797089699c6f12cbc3fe1b8d9eebbb2fb5931047d946a5c9c61\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/research.gold.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/28120; http:\\/\\/www.nationaldrama.org.uk\\/journal\\/current-issue\\/; https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=AfP-wdde5Y0&t=58s; https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=6NlDu1iRuAI&t=2s; Braverman,D., and Hunt, A.

The purpose of this research was to obtain evidence of the validity of the internal structure of the Morale Questionnaire used by the Spanish Armed Forces in military operations overseas. Two subsamples of 250 Spanish soldiers deployed on an international mission in Lebanon participated in the study. The questionnaire was applied at the beginning and at the end of the mission, respectly. The results obtained throughExploratory and Confirmatory Factorial Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling, allowed to assess the questionnaire statistically obtaining a tool that consists of 26 items, agglutinated in six factors. The theoretical dimensions of the original tool were mostly maintained. This will permit Spanish Armed Forces to have a reliable measuring instrument that will facilitate specific predictions about morale and its consecuences on the battlefield.ResumenEvaluar la moral de las tropas ha sido una preocupaci\\u00f3n de los l\\u00edderes militares a lo largo de la historia, principalmente por el nivel de participaci\\u00f3n que este factor podr\\u00eda tener en la resoluci\\u00f3n de conflictos en el campo de batalla.

Exploring the associations between motivation, transformational leadership, and innovation in a religious organization\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Religious organizations are social systems operating in a complex and changing environment. By looking to an authority beyond themselves, religious organizations have comparatively little control over defining their own goals. In this juggling between sticking to the ultimate goal of an organization and adapting to complex changing environments, that is, in the juggling between tradition and renewal, transformational leadership seems to play an important role in religious organizations. The extensive body of literature on transformational leadership has focused more on the outcomes of transformational leadership than on its antecedents. We extend the existing literature by linking managers' motivation to their transformational leadership behaviors in a religious organization. More specifically, we examined the associations of intrinsic and prosocial motivation with transformational leadership, and we investigated the relationship between transformational leadership and innovation among 252 managers in the largest nonprofit organization in Norway, the Church of Norway. Analyses in structural equation modeling revealed a positive relationship between intrinsic motivation and transformational leadership, whereas the relationship between prosocial motivation and transformational leadership was not significant. Transformational leadership was positively associated with innovation. Based on the results of the study, we discuss practical implications regarding how to support intrinsic motivation, transformational leadership, and innovation in religious organizations. ; publishedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"1-21 ; Nonprofit Management & Leadership\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"intrinsic motivation; innovation; prosocial motivation; religious organizations; transformational leadership; indre motivasjon; innovasjon; prososial motivasjon; religi\\u00f8se organisasjoner; transformasjonsledelse\",\"subject\":\"intrinsic motivation; innovation; prosocial motivation; religious organizations; transformational leadership; indre motivasjon; innovasjon; prososial motivasjon; religi\\u00f8se organisasjoner; transformasjonsledelse\",\"authors\":\"L\\u00f8vaas, Beate Jelstad; Jungert, Tomas; Van den Broeck, Anja; Haug, H\\u00e5vard\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2646680\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c3f8d817bf5504c72d3f0d98c7144aa167122e355adbe956a3cfce0bb43271f0\",\"relevance\":99},{\"id\":\"a80659835db790e2c345e45288613fd4a332adcf6ff21fa2a18470c2b68ff2a0\",\"relation\":\"Alami, Sarah, Von Rueden, Christopher, Seabright, Edmond, Kraft, Thomas S., Blackwell, Aaron D., Stieglitz, Jonathan, Kaplan, Hillard and Gurven, Michael (2020) Mother's social status is associated with child health in a horticulturalist population.

Here, we examine whether peer-rankings of women's social status (indicated by political influence, project leadership, and respect) positively covaries with child nutritional status and health in a community of Amazonian horticulturalists. We find that maternal political influence is associated with improved child health outcomes in models adjusting for maternal age, parental height and weight, level of schooling, household income, family size, and number of kin in the community. Children of politically influential women have higher weight-for-age (B = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.12\\u20130.54), height-for-age (B = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.10\\u20130.54), and weight-for-height (B = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.04\\u20130.44), and they are less likely to be diagnosed with common illnesses (OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.31\\u20130.76).

This statement is proved by literature analysis, where frugality and frugal innovations are presented as a determinant of sustainable development. However, in most of the cases the lack of empirical evidence of this situation can be noticed. The article includes a review of the literature describing frugal innovation. In the article, the definitions of frugal innovations are compared with some empirical propositions for frugality measuring in the companies. The aim of the paper is to describe the issue of frugal innovation, its definitions, manifestations and ways of measuring. The reason of conducting the study is a desire of verification how deep is the issue analysed in the literature. In order to achieve the aim of the paper, the following objectives have been set: (1) to discuss current definitions of frugal innovations; (2) to present the ways how frugal innovations can be manifested; (3) to describe current propositions of frugal innovation measures and to discuss if can they be used to measure frugal innovation efficiency in the companies. The analysis is based on literature review. First of all, there is presented the method of the study and detailed description of the research sampling process. Presentation of frugal innovation definitions is the second step of the study. The next step is to show the most common manifestations of frugal innovations. Considerations about these two elements are the causes of identifying the measures, which helps to assess the efficiency of frugal innovations. The study confirms that there is still a huge demand for deeper investigation of the issue, because the current literature does not provide the comprehensive understanding of it.

This unsustainability is not caused by a financial crisis, but is caused by its own design and initial conception. For this, the case of Sweden is shown as an example; and the policies adopted by this Nordic country to correct the unsustainability of the welfare state mentioned above.Design\\/methodology\\/approach: The applied methodology has been, on the one hand, a literary review of the welfare state concept. On the other hand, an analysis has been carried out with various economic indicators that serve to corroborate the aforementioned unsustainability and the effect of the decisions taken by Sweden.Research and practical limitations\\/implications: The analysis ofeconomic variables such as GDP or the collection of taxes on GDP is burdened with the classical limitation on the cause-effect relationship. The problem of causality in economics is one of the most significant in the discipline. This problem is fundamental in historical analyses, when it comes to relating a phenomenon that has occurred with the causes that generated it.Originality: The debate about the welfare state and its sustainability is gaining strength from very different spheres. In an unstable and highly globalised economic environment, the role that states must play in theeconomy is being reformulated. The present paper analyses the development and growth of the welfare state as one of the differential elements of the developed economies (especially in the Western European area), and its subsequent crisis and loss of legitimacy due to its financial unsustainability.Findings: This article shows how the introduction of private companies that provide public services can be a solution to the welfare state crisis. For this, the Swedish case is used as an example. In the Nordic country,it was found that the introduction of private companies in the provision of public services has not reduced social assistance services or their quality. What is important, it has been a new competitive management, which guarantees the quality of the services provided, at a lower cost to the public sector budget.Paper type: theoretical paper.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Corporate Responsibility and Leadership; Vol 5, No 4 (2018): Innovations in Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Management; 27-44 ; 2392-2699 ; 2392-2680\",\"year\":\"2020-01-10\",\"subject_orig\":\"welfare state; crisis of welfare state; Swedish model; civil society\",\"subject\":\"welfare state; crisis of welfare state; Swedish model; civil society\",\"authors\":\"N\\u00e1\\u00f1ez Alonso, Sergio Luis\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/JCRL\\/article\\/view\\/JCRL.2018.021\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"54a229c922965f6cb908fcccfb164c3fb684a765a0a3d1803652cef270a7c267\",\"relevance\":96},{\"id\":\"22512ec20cdede891d83ba387c9e3df2e1757f7087177207dfe6cd953c46d1bb\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/JCRL\\/article\\/view\\/JCRL.2018.022\\/24562; https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/JCRL\\/article\\/view\\/JCRL.2018.022; doi:10.12775\\/JCRL.2018.022\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/JCRL\\/article\\/view\\/JCRL.2018.022; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.12775\\/JCRL.2018.022\",\"title\":\"Public Investment Management of Higher Education in Vietnam : Current Issues and Policy Recommendations\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose: The aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensive insight on public investment management practices in higher education and experiences of developed countries, to analyse the current approaches to public investment management in Vietnam and to propose applicablepolicy recommendations.Design\\/methodology\\/approach: Case study based on literature of public investment in higher education and analysis of legal documents, reports and data regarding Vietnam\\u2019s current practices in the field.Findings: Public investment management practices of Vietnam still follow the traditional approach, which has shown various weaknesses and drawbacks in terms of efficiency, lack of unification, and incapability of higher education institutions to seek for autonomy and alternative operational resources.Research and practical limitations\\/implications: Lack of quantitative data and survey tools to enhance the practical implementation of the study.Originality\\/value: This paper can become a reference resource for policy makers in terms of promoting reforms in the public investment system for higher education in the future.Paper type: Case study.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Corporate Responsibility and Leadership; Vol 5, No 4 (2018): Innovations in Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Management; 45-66 ; 2392-2699 ; 2392-2680\",\"year\":\"2020-01-10\",\"subject_orig\":\"higher education; public investment; public investment management; higher education funding\",\"subject\":\"higher education; public investment; public investment management; higher education funding\",\"authors\":\"Lan, Le Ngoc; Trang, Vu Minh\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/JCRL\\/article\\/view\\/JCRL.2018.022\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"22512ec20cdede891d83ba387c9e3df2e1757f7087177207dfe6cd953c46d1bb\",\"relevance\":95},{\"id\":\"e03cca5385bf44597a9880ce784144d9a23cc05a99cdbc03f2b69ace2fc35b87\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/DN\\/article\\/view\\/DN.2019.4.07\\/24833; https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/DN\\/article\\/view\\/DN.2019.4.07; doi:10.12775\\/DN.2019.4.07\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/DN\\/article\\/view\\/DN.2019.4.07; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.12775\\/DN.2019.4.07\",\"title\":\"The Multi-Outlook Socialism Concept of the PAX Association as Estimated by the Central State Security Organs of People\\u2019s Poland under W\\u0142adys\\u0142aw Gomu\\u0142ka and Edward Gierek (1956\\u20131980) ; Koncepcja socjalizmu wielo\\u015bwiatopogl\\u0105dowego Stowarzyszenia \\u201ePAX\\u201d w ocenie centralnych organ\\u00f3w bezpiecze\\u0144stwa Polski Ludowej w okresie rz\\u0105d\\u00f3w W\\u0142adys\\u0142awa Gomu\\u0142ki i Edwarda Gierka (1956\\u20131980)\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The PAX Association under the leadership of Boles\\u0142aw Piasecki sought to create a party of Catholics on their political bases.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose: The purpose of the study was to identify the internal development determinants of Polish companies in the USA, considering the character of their activity, i.e. splitting them into two business sectors \\u2013 traditional industries and new technologies.Methodology: The research has been conducted using a mail survey method among Polish companies in the USA. As a result, 19 properly filled survey questionnaires were returned.Findings: The findings of the research indicated that Polish companies see major determinants of development in the USA in internal factors, including applied technology, innovative products\\/services, organisation of production processes\\/services and management skills. Slight differences in the answers of companies representing both groups (traditional industries and new technologies) mainly concerned the strength of impact of particular assets. For companies in the new technologies group, most important growth determinants were, above all, used technology and innovation of products\\/services, while companies operating in traditional industries found the strongest positive impact in leadership, competences of the management staff and organisation culture.Implications: Both the research results and the very fact of involvement in foreign investments in such competitive environment demonstrate that Polish companies are aware of the strength of their assets. Just as enterprises from the developed countries, they benefit from ownership advantages on foreign markets. These are not, however, cost advantages attributed to companies from the emerging markets in the subject literature, but those perceived as the domain of the companies from the developed countries.Originality: This paper concerns a still insufficiently defined problem of foreign direct investments of companies from mid-range emerging economies in developed countries.Keywords: foreign direct investment, internationalisation, internal development determinants, foreign subsidiaries, Central and Eastern EuropePaper type: Research paper\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Positive Management; Vol 9, No 4 (2018); 3-15 ; 2392-1412 ; 2083-103X\",\"year\":\"2020-02-19\",\"subject_orig\":\"foreign direct investment; internationalisation; internal development determinants; foreign subsidiaries; Central and Eastern Europe\",\"subject\":\"foreign direct investment; internationalisation; internal development determinants; foreign subsidiaries; Central and Eastern Europe\",\"authors\":\"Kuczmarska, Magdalena\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/JPM\\/article\\/view\\/JPM.2018.151\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"1f01a6755ce16d6a3c2adb9a8f29de9c48dcc3afaff7f5ea573ef858d560d989\",\"relevance\":93},{\"id\":\"cd4fc21a01c009c7f7dd15eab70ad1bf1c60798cbb1d0f3ac7bbe902c5614a34\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/upo.es\\/revistas\\/index.php\\/RevMetCuant\\/article\\/view\\/3580\\/3930; https:\\/\\/upo.es\\/revistas\\/index.php\\/RevMetCuant\\/article\\/view\\/3580\\/4047; Aitchison, J.

Besides the dependence of results on ratio choice, ratios themselves pose a number of problems when subjected to a principal component analysis, such as skewed distributions. In this work, we put forward an alternative method drawn from compositional data analysis (CoDa), a standard statistical toolbox for use when data convey information about relative magnitudes, as financial ratios do. The method, referred to as the CoDa biplot, does not rely on any particular choice of financial ratio but allows researchers to visually order firms along the pairwise financial ratios for any two accounts. Non-financial magnitudes and time evolution can be added to the visualization as desired. We show an example of its application to the top chains in the Spanish grocery retail sector and show how the technique can be used to depict strategic management differences in financial structure or performance, and their evolution over time. ; Las ratios financieras se utilizan a menudo en el an\\u00e1lisis en componentes principales y t\\u00e9cnicas relacionadas con el fin de reducir y visualizar los datos.

En este trabajo, presentamos un m\\u00e9todo alternativo que proviene del an\\u00e1lisis de datos composicionales (CoDa), una caja de herramientas estad\\u00edstica est\\u00e1ndar para usar cuando los datos contienen informaci\\u00f3n sobre magnitudes relativas, como lo hacen las ratios financieras. El m\\u00e9todo, conocido como el biplot CoDa, no se basa en una elecci\\u00f3n particular de ratios financieras, sino que permite a los investigadores ordenar visualmente las empresas a lo largo de las ratios financieras entre cualesquiera pares de cuentas. Las magnitudes no financieras y la evoluci\\u00f3n temporal se pueden agregar a la visualizaci\\u00f3n como se desee. Mostramos un ejemplo de su aplicaci\\u00f3n a las principales cadenas de supermercados espa\\u00f1olas y mostramos c\\u00f3mo la t\\u00e9cnica puede utilizarse para describir las diferencias de gesti\\u00f3n estrat\\u00e9gica en la estructura o el rendimiento financieros, y su evoluci\\u00f3n en el tiempo.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Quantitative Methods for Economics and Business Administration; Vol 29 (2020); 18-37 ; Revista de M\\u00e9todos Cuantitativos para la Econom\\u00eda y la Empresa; Vol. 29 (2020); 18-37 ; 1886-516X\",\"year\":\"2020-01-23\",\"subject_orig\":\"financial ratio; compositional data analysis (CoDa); biplot; grocery retail sector; data visualization; ratio financiera; an\\u00e1lisis de datos composicionales (CoDa); sector de distribuci\\u00f3n alimentaria; visualizaci\\u00f3n de datos\",\"subject\":\"financial ratio; compositional data analysis (CoDa); biplot; grocery retail sector; data visualization; ratio financiera; an\\u00e1lisis de datos composicionales (CoDa); sector de distribuci\\u00f3n alimentaria; visualizaci\\u00f3n de datos\",\"authors\":\"Carreras Sim\\u00f3, Miquel; Coenders, Germ\\u00e0\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/upo.es\\/revistas\\/index.php\\/RevMetCuant\\/article\\/view\\/3580\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"cd4fc21a01c009c7f7dd15eab70ad1bf1c60798cbb1d0f3ac7bbe902c5614a34\",\"relevance\":92},{\"id\":\"c0607e5e5313c7223731949e03d0745e1fa8fca9343134e3f42fcd3212f9b001\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/upo.es\\/revistas\\/index.php\\/IJERI\\/article\\/view\\/4582\\/3968; https:\\/\\/upo.es\\/revistas\\/index.php\\/IJERI\\/article\\/view\\/4582\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/upo.es\\/revistas\\/index.php\\/IJERI\\/article\\/view\\/4582\",\"title\":\"Influence of the teaching Leadership in the motivation of university students ; Influencia del Liderazgo docente en la motivaci\\u00f3n de universitarios\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper presents the results of a study on the influence of teacher leadership on the motivation of university students, of Division Academica de Ciencias Economico Administrativas from Universidad Juarez Autonoma de Tabasco, in Mexico.

The survey was conducted from February to May 2015 using the anonymous written questionnaire as a basic research tool and completed by 197 nursery head teachers from nine counties in the country. The results of the research showed that the overwhelming majority of the head teachers perceive that the models of transformational and charismatic leadership significantly contributes to the effectiveness of educational work in pre-school education and that the majority of respondents adopt a mixed model of participatory \\/transactional leadership with strong elements of transformational \\/ charismatic leadership.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0395\\u03c1\\u03b5\\u03c5\\u03bd\\u03ce\\u03bd\\u03c4\\u03b1\\u03c2 \\u03c4\\u03bf\\u03bd \\u03ba\\u03cc\\u03c3\\u03bc\\u03bf \\u03c4\\u03bf\\u03c5 \\u03c0\\u03b1\\u03b9\\u03b4\\u03b9\\u03bf\\u03cd; Vol 16 (2019); 72-83 ; Investigating the child\\u2019s world; Vol 16 (2019); 72-83 ; 2623-3487 ; 1106-5036\",\"year\":\"2020-03-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u0397\\u03b3\\u03b5\\u03c3\\u03af\\u03b1; \\u03a3\\u03c4\\u03c5\\u03bb \\u03b7\\u03b3\\u03b5\\u03c3\\u03af\\u03b1\\u03c2; \\u03a0\\u03c1\\u03bf\\u03c3\\u03c7\\u03bf\\u03bb\\u03b9\\u03ba\\u03ae \\u03b5\\u03ba\\u03c0\\u03b1\\u03af\\u03b4\\u03b5\\u03c5\\u03c3\\u03b7; Leadership; Style leadership; Pre-school education\",\"subject\":\"\\u0397\\u03b3\\u03b5\\u03c3\\u03af\\u03b1; \\u03a3\\u03c4\\u03c5\\u03bb \\u03b7\\u03b3\\u03b5\\u03c3\\u03af\\u03b1\\u03c2; \\u03a0\\u03c1\\u03bf\\u03c3\\u03c7\\u03bf\\u03bb\\u03b9\\u03ba\\u03ae \\u03b5\\u03ba\\u03c0\\u03b1\\u03af\\u03b4\\u03b5\\u03c5\\u03c3\\u03b7; Leadership; Style leadership; Pre-school education\",\"authors\":\"\\u039b\\u03b1\\u03b6\\u03b1\\u03c1\\u03af\\u03b4\\u03bf\\u03c5 (Lazaridou Isaia), \\u0399\\u03c3\\u03b1\\u0390\\u03b1 \\u0399\\u03ce\\u03b2\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr\\/index.php\\/omep\\/article\\/view\\/20848\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a60a81f762bf700ea8d5987ba1c9d867accc01fe1a39ec0d8147e59aad368ec2\",\"relevance\":90},{\"id\":\"82245ed08241c3b23198a7bb313041f3426b6e1e358fb0925c0da7825b4dae48\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.1016\\/j.erss.2020.101442; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/wos\\/000538411700018; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11850\\/403826; doi:10.3929\\/ethz-b-000403826\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11850\\/403826; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3929\\/ethz-b-000403826\",\"title\":\"Canada's Green New Deal: Forging the socio-political foundations of climate resilient infrastructure?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"A global movement is underway to harness the power of coordinated state policy to address the significant and interrelated challenges of environmental degradation, climate change, poverty, and energy insecurity. In May 2019 a grassroots coalition comprising a range of civil society groups\\u2014scientists, labour unions, Indigenous peoples, and youth\\u2014launched the Pact for a Green New Deal (PGND) in Canada, with more than 150 town hall meetings across the country. Participants called for 100% renewable energy, phase out of the oil sands, a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030, and the creation of 1 million new green jobs and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples [1]. A significant reorientation to the scale and direction of government expenditure, as happened in the American New Deal of the 1930s, can spur technical innovation but can also exacerbate inequalities. A Canadian green transition is significant globally given its high energy production, exports, and internal use. In this perspective piece we examine the transformative potential of a Canadian PGND by focusing on the social and political characteristics of energy infrastructure: the potential for 100% renewable energy, transitions for oil sands, energy democracy, Indigenous energy leadership, gender equity, and energy poverty. The actor coalitions emerging from these then forge specific energy transition pathways, whether just and inclusive, or not. The Canadian case highlights the complexities and opportunities that accompany countries with large geographies, fraught geo-political histories, strong federalism, inequalities of access to clean affordable energy, and an abundance of renewable energy.\",\"published_in\":\"Energy Research and Social Science, 65\",\"year\":\"2020-07\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"MacArthur, Julie L.; Hoicka, Christina E.; Castleden, Heather; Das, Runa; Lieu, Jenny\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11850\\/403826\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"82245ed08241c3b23198a7bb313041f3426b6e1e358fb0925c0da7825b4dae48\",\"relevance\":89},{\"id\":\"cf10e7d375739e672353ccec5fad4810bc43da6b39262d419117f61c9c669e0a\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uim.ac.id\\/index.php\\/ahsana\\/article\\/view\\/775\\/525; http:\\/\\/journal.uim.ac.id\\/index.php\\/ahsana\\/article\\/view\\/775; doi:10.31102\\/ahsana.6.1.2020.21-30\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uim.ac.id\\/index.php\\/ahsana\\/article\\/view\\/775; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.31102\\/ahsana.6.1.2020.21-30\",\"title\":\"DINASTI FATHIMIYAH MASA KEMAJUAN DAN KONTRIBUSI DINASTI FATIMIYAH TERHADAP PERADABAN ISLAM\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In the history of Islam, following the reign of the Rasyidin Rashidun, was succeeded by rulers who formed power with a system of family power or dynasty.

The constant comparative analysis method according to Glaser was used to answer the aim of the study. Results: Trust was seen as the core of the interviews and was based on three categories: leadership, preparedness and endurance. Discussion: The core category trust, and the lack of trust, may be a result of poor preparedness. The respondents expressed that they felt safe and secure within their own group.

In light of the centrality of universal health coverage (UHC) in driving current health policy, we sought to examine the value interests that influence agenda setting in the country\\u2019s health financing space. Given the plurality of Kenya\\u2019s health policy levers, we aimed to examine how the perspectives of stakeholders involved in policy decision-making and implementation shape discussions on health financing within the UHC framework. Methods A series of in-depth key informant interviews were conducted at national and county level (n = 13) between April and May 2018. Final thematic analysis using the Framework Method was conducted to identify similarities and differences amongst stakeholders on the challenges hindering Kenya\\u2019s achievement of UHC in terms of its the optimisation of health service coverage; expansion of the population that benefits from essential healthcare services; and the minimisation of out-of-pocket costs associated with health-seeking behaviour. Results Our findings indicate that the perceived lack of strategic leadership from Kenya\\u2019s national government has led to a lack of agreement on stakeholders\\u2019 interpretation of what is to be understood by UHC, its contextual values and priorities. We observe material differences between and within policy networks on the country\\u2019s priorities for population coverage, healthcare service provision, and cost-sharing under the UHC dispensation. In spite of this, we note that progressive universalism is considered as the preferred approach towards UHC in Kenya, with most interviewees prioritising an equity-based approach that prioritises better access to healthcare services and financial risk protection. However, the conflicting priorities of key stakeholders risk derailing progress towards the expansion of access to health services and financial risk protection. Conclusions This study adds to existing knowledge of UHC in Kenya by contextualising the competing and evolving priorities that should be taken into consideration as the country strategises over its UHC process. We suggest that clear policy action is required from national government and county governments in order to develop a logical and consistent approach towards UHC in Kenya.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Health Services Research, Vol 20, Iss 1, Pp 1-11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Kenya; UHC; Priority-setting; Health financing; Health policy; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"Kenya; UHC; Priority-setting; Health financing; Health policy; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Tessa Oraro-Lawrence; Kaspar Wyss\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12913-020-5041-x\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b5352bb017d258339ab175a9a140cbeecaff0639b79dc198bdeb944cc9cfaffa\",\"relevance\":82},{\"id\":\"9184c6a1a829323ff428b617bc500d33632b3019ec23e575fef60fc41322c568\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1186\\/s12992-020-00558-3; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1744-8603; doi:10.1186\\/s12992-020-00558-3; 1744-8603; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a452d5b4447942eb9471989538dec597\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12992-020-00558-3; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a452d5b4447942eb9471989538dec597\",\"title\":\"A qualitative exploration of the experiences of community health animation on malaria control in rural Malawi\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background While great strides have been achieved in fighting malaria through the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) strategy, the recent world malaria report shows an increase in malaria-related deaths compared to previous years. Malaria control tools are efficacious and effective in preventing the disease; however, the human behaviour aspect of the intervention strategies is weak due to heavy reliance on positive human health behaviour. The challenge lies in adoption of control interventions by the target population which, to an extent, may include access to prevention and treatment tools. We present a qualitative assessment of the use of the Health Animator (HA) model for Information, Education and Communication (IEC) to improve adoption and use of malaria control by promoting positive health behaviours. Results We conducted 3 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and 23 individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with HAs. Each FGD consisted of 8 participants. Data was analysed using QSR International NVivo 10 software. There are four main themes emerging regarding HA experiences. The perceptions include; collaborative work experience, personal motivation and growth, community participation with health animation and challenges with implementation. Results suggest that HAs were pleased with the training as they gained new information regarding malaria, which affected their use of malaria control interventions within their families. Knowledge was well assimilated from the trainings and influenced personal growth in becoming a community leader. Support from the leadership within the village and the health system was important in legitimising the main messages. The community responded positively to the workshops valued the information imparted. The voluntary nature of the work in a poverty-stricken community affected sustainability. Conclusions There is need to empower communities with strategies within their reach. Functioning traditional social support structures are a crucial element in sustainability. Voluntarism is also key for sustainability, especially for rural and remote communities with limited sources of income.\",\"published_in\":\"Globalization and Health, Vol 16, Iss 1, Pp 1-10 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Behaviour change communication; Community engagement; Community health animator; Health animation; Health education; Malaria; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"Behaviour change communication; Community engagement; Community health animator; Health animation; Health education; Malaria; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Tumaini Malenga; Frances E.

The proposed model, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, includes psychosocial factors (transformational leadership, workgroup identification, and shared understanding) and organizational factors (knowledge sharing opportunities and formalization of knowledge sharing processes) as antecedents of individuals' attitudes, perception of subjective norms associated with their group and their direct supervisor, and intention and effective knowledge-sharing behavior. Methods: the model was statistically tested using structural equation modeling techniques with data provided by 131 customer service employees of a large Brazilian telecommunications company. Results: the results indicate that the psychosocial elements have a strong influence on knowledge sharing attitudes and practices. The hypotheses associated with behavioral control have not been confirmed. Moreover, the intention to share knowledge does not seem to be affected by the subjective norms associated with the individual's direct supervisor, but only by those related to their group. Conclusions: the cognitive proximity between group members, reflected in their perception of shared understanding, was an important element in the elicitation of attitudes favorable to knowledge sharing. Additionally, individuals with greater identification with their group tended to have more positive attitudes toward sharing their knowledge. This attitude tends to be more positive when the individual's direct supervisor adopts a more transformational leadership style. The influence of leaders seems to extend from the development of a culture of knowledge exchange and diffusion of principles that stimulate this exchange, to the creation of opportunities to share knowledge through the active management of knowledge diffusion in their teams.\",\"published_in\":\"RAC: Revista de Administra\\u00e7\\u00e3o Contempor\\u00e2nea, Vol 24, Iss 4, Pp 283-299 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"compartilhamento de conhecimento; teoria do comportamento planejado; lideran\\u00e7a transformacional; identifica\\u00e7\\u00e3o; entendimento compartilhado; Management.

First, we analyzed what the effect of transformational leadership and procedural justice on trust in the organization and sustainable organizational identity is. Secondly, we examined the mediator effect on organizational trust, in addition to the effects of transformational leadership and procedural justice on sustainable organizational identity. The sample of the study consists of 558 subjects from Turkey, 106 subjects from Azerbaijan, and 95 subjects from Kyrgyzstan\\u2014a total of 759 subjects. To analyze the collected data, we used correlation analysis, regression analyses, and ANOVA testing. For these analyses, we used the SPSS statistical software. The results indicate that transformational leadership and procedural justice positively and significantly affect manager trust. Moreover, manager trust has a positive and significant impact on creating a sustainable organizational identity. The results of the regression analyses further show that in the relationship between transformational leadership and procedural justice with sustainable organizational identity, there is a full effect of mediation on the perception of manager trust. Moreover, there is an indirect relationship among transformational leadership and procedural justice with creating a sustainable organizational identity, and this relationship is established through the perception of manager trust. The results of the study suggest that an efficient way to increase the trust of managers by employees is to increase procedural justice and to follow a transformational leadership style in the workplace.

This paper puts forward a supposed model of the influence mechanism of safety leadership (SL) on employee SCB through the mediation of safety attitude (SA). A questionnaire was used with railway employees, and 238 valid responses were finally collected. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to explore the relationship between SL, SA and SCB.

In Colombia, poverty is one of those causes present mainly in rural areas where one in 10 children suffers from malnutrition. Methodology We searched ScienceDirect, PubMed, ClinicalKey, and SciELO for references on child malnutrition, its social determinants, and elements for its intervention in Colombia. Results The review allowed us to identify that many factors influence this problem determined not only by the lack of food but also by other factors such as poverty, lack of resources, restricted access to health care, rising prices of essential foods, political conflicts leading forced displacement, drought, the absence of an equity-based policy approach, poor environmental sanitation, among others. Conclusions Child malnutrition should not be conceived as mainly a food-related problem. Other factors that influence this problem should also be taken into account in order to prevent it. Trained personnel should be deployed to intervene in the social determinants that underpin child malnutrition. Thus, in Colombia, the family physician is a fundamental link in the health system, responsible for providing comprehensive medical care and for the leadership of the newly introduced health model based on primary health care.\",\"published_in\":\"Medwave, Vol 20, Iss 02, Pp e7839-e7839 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"social determinants of health; childhood; child malnutrition; poverty; human rights; equity; primary health care; colombia; Medicine; R; Medicine (General); R5-920\",\"subject\":\"social determinants of health; childhood; child malnutrition; poverty; human rights; equity; primary health care; colombia; Medicine; R; \",\"authors\":\"M\\u00f3nica Vargas; Erwin Hern\\u00e1ndez\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5867\\/medwave.2020.02.7839\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"09ba575f583f16054475e1a7ecdd9821203c001eedaecf8ac775899fe92a9071\",\"relevance\":75},{\"id\":\"26ee9e43c1b517c32cd39b423286880d7636862ab1b27fafd88dee945f571fb8\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00519\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1664-1078; 1664-1078; doi:10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00519; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9a1f6d213b97476cbabd8e878bcfce68\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00519; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9a1f6d213b97476cbabd8e878bcfce68\",\"title\":\"Leading Teachers\\u2019 Emotions Like Parents: Relationships Between Paternalistic Leadership, Emotional Labor and Teacher Commitment in China\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Emotional labor plays an essential role in school leadership and teaching, as principals and teachers undergo complex interactions with students, colleagues, and parents.

Researchers from different fields such as Psychology, Medicine, Educational sciences, Economy and Business embrace the notion of Spiritual Intelligence. Nevertheless, it is considered as one of the most controversial and highly debated notions. The first section of this study gives a brief overview of the essential theoretical framework including definitions and theories related to Spiritual Intelligence. In the second section, we present a layered approach of Spiritual Intelligence based on the corresponding layered models of Knowledge-Intelligence-Consciousness. The results of this study showed that Spiritual Intelligence constitutes the backbone of every subsystem of human intelligence as it integrates, matures and transforms every physical, intellectual, and emotional ability and leads to the highest forms of self-awareness, self-knowledge and consciousness. The realization of our true Self, of our hidden and highest potentialities is tied inseparably with the hierarchical organization of knowledge through metacognition and executive functions. Specifically, higher order forms of self-observation, self-regulation through attentional, emotional and impulse control, problem solving, mental flexibility and adaptation could reveal our true and eternal identity. Spiritual intelligence is essential to be incorporated mainly into the dialogue of business ethics, leadership, mental health and psychotherapy, education especially in the case of learning disabilities and gifted education\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Recent Contributions from Engineering, Science & IT, Vol 8, Iss 1, Pp 4-23 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u2014 consciousness; self-awareness; metacognition; self-regulation; executive functions; neuroscience; perception; memory; attention; emotional control; prob-lem-solving; Computer engineering.

Currently there are three main stages in the recruitment process: the first stage is to submit an online application, the second stage is the interview, and the third stage is undergoing a probation period as a school principal. A significant finding was that school principals at present are not satisfied with the current recruitment process and see it in need of change. Thus some recommendations made in this study are presented based on the research findings and school principals\\u2019 reflections and experiences. School principals felt they would benefit from more specialized training in leadership and management skills, as well as, visits to successful schools both in the United Arab Emirates and overseas. One important recommendation was to develop a new academic diploma focusing on management and leadership skills for school principals, a \\u2018Principalship Diploma\\u2019 which covers the fundamental core content, training and requirements for educational leadership and effective performance.

I argue that tweets from prime ministers implicitly communicate information about how prime ministers lead and what their job entails: what I call role performance and function. I develop an inductive typology of these leadership dimensions and apply this framework to Trudeau and May\\u2019s tweets in 2018 and 2019. I find first that Trudeau is a much more active Twitter user than Theresa May was as prime minister, attesting to different leadership styles. Second, both use Twitter primarily for publicity and to support and associate with individuals and groups. Trudeau is much more likely to use Twitter to portray himself as a non-political figure, while May is more likely to emphasize the role of policy \\u2018decider.\\u2019 Both prime ministers are framed much more often as national legislative leaders rather than party leaders or executives.

The election brought an end to the long reign of the Ontario Liberal Party (2003\\u20132018), whose government devolved into a series of scandals that resulted in a third-place finish. The Liberal\\u2019s defeat came at the hands of the Progressive Conservative Party led by former Toronto city councillor, Doug Ford. The Progressive Conservative\\u2019s victory was propelled on the back of Ford\\u2019s deeply populist campaign where he promised to reassert the interests of \\u2018the people,\\u2019 expel the influence of elites and special interests, and clean up government corruption. This campaign discourse led many political opponents and media pundits to accuse Ford of importing the nativist, xenophobic, and divisive rhetoric of other radical right-wing populist leaders. This article advances the argument that rather than representing the importation of \\u2018Trumpism\\u2019 or other types of radical right-wing populism, Ford\\u2019s campaign is better understood within the tradition of Canadian populism defined by an overarching ideological commitment to neoliberalism. In appealing to voters, Ford avoided the nativist and xenophobic rhetoric of populist leaders in the United States and Western Europe, offering a conception of \\u2018the people\\u2019 using an economic and anti-cosmopolitan discourse centred upon middle class taxpayers. This article makes a contribution to both the literatures on Canadian elections and populism, demonstrating the lineage of Ford\\u2019s ideological commitment to populism within recent Canadian electoral history, as well as Ford\\u2019s place within the international genealogy of right-wing populism.\",\"published_in\":\"Politics and Governance, Vol 8, Iss 1, Pp 171-181 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"canada; neoliberalism; political leadership; populism; right-wing politics; Political science (General); JA1-92\",\"subject\":\"canada; neoliberalism; political leadership; populism; right-wing politics; \",\"authors\":\"Brian Budd\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17645\\/pag.v8i1.2468\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"69c9e56a1e53ae994081c3de2710f1e17fea12b02fb53c0d30c1e77e2bc604fc\",\"relevance\":63},{\"id\":\"0ba18954ca5280ddefba5e58951632ae95ff758097a62f804a0eae42b8dddac9\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2073-445X\\/9\\/2\\/58; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2073-445X; 2073-445X; doi:10.3390\\/land9020058; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/11605947c73748689335d55f9997a228\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/land9020058; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/11605947c73748689335d55f9997a228\",\"title\":\"Collective Action Dilemma after China\\u2019s Forest Tenure Reform: Operationalizing Forest Devolution in a Rapidly Changing Society\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Devolution is a promising tool to enhance forest management. The literature has discussed many factors that affect the outcomes of forest devolution policies; however, insufficient attention has been paid to the role of exogenous socio-economic changes. Using the longitudinal case study method, we focus on how socio-economic changes affect the effectiveness of forest devolution policies using a case from Southeast China. We find that in this case, although forest devolution succeeded in granting farmers sufficient forest rights, it failed to incentivize farmers to contribute to managing forests because of the dramatic changes in socio-economic contexts. Economic development and outmigration reduced farmers\\u2019 dependence on forest income, elevated the costs of silvicultural operations, and posed market risks, thereby reducing farmers\\u2019 enthusiasm about managing forests; outmigration also weakened community leadership and impeded the collective action of making forest investments. Eventually, socio-economic changes compromised the positive stimulus caused by forest devolution and contributed to the collective action dilemma of managing forests after the reform. We argue that operationalizing forest devolution in developing countries needs to consider the exogenous socio-economic changes that may enhance or counteract the effects of devolution policies, and that more autonomy should be granted to communities to make policies adaptative to their local socio-economic dynamics.\",\"published_in\":\"Land, Vol 9, Iss 2, p 58 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"forest devolution; collective action; socio-economic change; forest tenure reform; outmigration; Agriculture; S\",\"subject\":\"forest devolution; collective action; socio-economic change; forest tenure reform; outmigration; Agriculture; S\",\"authors\":\"Zhang Yiwen; Shashi Kant; Hexing Long\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/land9020058\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"0ba18954ca5280ddefba5e58951632ae95ff758097a62f804a0eae42b8dddac9\",\"relevance\":62},{\"id\":\"eb861f880c616ba214f8b27d54419beedbefdd28167c489376eebdada3a7ce1d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/1660-4601\\/17\\/4\\/1200; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1660-4601; 1660-4601; doi:10.3390\\/ijerph17041200; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2b9da98996d145d5bd20fb5aecf1f380\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17041200; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2b9da98996d145d5bd20fb5aecf1f380\",\"title\":\"Predicting Sustainable Employability in Swedish Healthcare: The Complexity of Social Job Resources\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Achieving sustainable employability (SE), i.e., when employees are able to continue working in a productive, satisfactory, and healthy manner, is a timely challenge for healthcare. Because healthcare is a female-dominated sector, our paper investigated the role of social job resources in promoting SE. To better illustrate the complexity of the organizational environment, we incorporated resources that operate at different levels (individual, group) and in different planes (horizontal, vertical): trust (individual-vertical), teamwork (group-horizontal), and transformational leadership (group-vertical). Based on the job demands-resources model, we predicted that these resources initiate the motivational process and thus promote SE. To test these predictions, we conducted a 3-wave study in 42 units of a healthcare organization in Sweden. The final study sample consisted of 269 professionals. The results of the multilevel analyses demonstrated that, at the individual level, vertical trust was positively related to all three facets of SE. Next, at the group level, teamwork had a positive link with employee health and productivity, while transformational leadership was negatively related to productivity. These findings underline the importance of acknowledging the levels and planes at which social job resources operate to more accurately capture the complexity of organizational phenomena and to design interventions that target the right level of the environment.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 4, p 1200 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"sustainable employability; healthcare; female-dominated workplace; social job resources; trust; teamwork; job satisfaction; health; job performance; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"sustainable employability; healthcare; female-dominated workplace; social job resources; trust; teamwork; job satisfaction; health; job performance; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Marta Roczniewska; Anne Richter; Henna Hasson; Ulrica von Thiele Schwarz\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17041200\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"eb861f880c616ba214f8b27d54419beedbefdd28167c489376eebdada3a7ce1d\",\"relevance\":61},{\"id\":\"094f59e3da65b5e1f035150ce8e2ac7c3aee2e665846ed34f46a79bc7906f090\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2076-0752\\/9\\/1\\/22; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2076-0752; 2076-0752; doi:10.3390\\/arts9010022; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/ada4555b48ec419584928a4201db42b9\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/arts9010022; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/ada4555b48ec419584928a4201db42b9\",\"title\":\"The Construction of the Great Synagogue in Stockholm, 1860\\u20131870: A Space for Jewish and Swedish-Christian Dialogues\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The construction of the Great Synagogue in Stockholm during the 1860s initiated Jewish communal debates on the position and public presence of Jews in the Swedish pre-emancipatory society.

After the global crisis of 2008\\u22122009, the world economy entered the era of restructuring. This article focuses on the risks that a new leader will face in the process of shaping the world economy. The methods employed in the research include big data processing of continuous change and the results of the symmetric macroeconomic analysis based on the statistics collected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), The Word Bank (WB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Central banks and Treasuries. The study results proved that the recessionary processes, their depth and global nature, are caused by a combination of world financial system crises and general civilization problems. These new systemic risks for the world economy might result in new global crises that will limit the resources of international financial institutions for sustainable development. Besides, for most banks these crises will mean shifting a big share of derivatives to the off-balance liabilities, using Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in deals, followed by an increase in state and corporate debts, trade wars, a slowdown of economic development in China, and widening contradictions between global and national finances. Regular research and systematization have developed certain guidelines for the global economic restructuring process. First of all, it is recommended on the base of interstate compromises to focus on international agreements to ensure a solid foundation for global finance. On the basis of the comparative analysis carried out for the USA, China and other counties, it was made clear that no one leader in world economy in 21st century views the world reserve as based on the currency of one country only. Instead, there will be a slow transition to using Special Drawing Rights (SDR) with a basket from 15\\u221220 currencies G20.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Financial Studies, Vol 8, Iss 1, p 7 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"world economy; nature of global crises; risks of the financial markets; leadership problem; Finance; HG1-9999\",\"subject\":\"world economy; nature of global crises; risks of the financial markets; leadership problem; Finance; \",\"authors\":\"Viacheslav M.

One aspect of the country\\u2019s global reorientation has been its increased interest in, and willingness to play a role in, global health. In the early 2010s, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) initiated a collaboration with the Chinese government on a programme to support the country to play a greater and more effective global role in health and explore how the UK and China could work together on issues of key concern and contribute to improved global development outcomes. The programme worked with key Chinese agencies to carry out capacity building, support analysis of China\\u2019s approaches to engagement in global health governance and assistance, and provide support to government decision making. It also trialled several small-scale interventions in third countries through which Chinese agencies gained experience of working on health programmes overseas. The article reports on the main findings of an evaluation commissioned by DFID to learn from the programme. The programme provided support at a key time in China\\u2019s global reorientation; however, there is a need for continued development of capacity and systems for China to play the role envisaged by the country\\u2019s leadership. There is also a need for continued exploration on the part of China and partners of how to effectively collaborate to support improved global outcomes.\",\"published_in\":\"Global Health Research and Policy, Vol 5, Iss 1, Pp 1-8 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Lewis Husain; Gerald Bloom; Sam McPherson\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s41256-020-00156-1\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b9da14134e06f3ffb3a91707ac085a3cc59c9ee0943ec318058470456e40e7a4\",\"relevance\":54},{\"id\":\"c376fe03de00461e77bee872350b81218dd50b13c94f0b4f1026c35736e13490\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2077-0383\\/9\\/6\\/1898; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2077-0383; doi:10.3390\\/jcm9061898; 2077-0383; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/fd3f40c18fb94835bf9c5e0ac3a6144d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/jcm9061898; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/fd3f40c18fb94835bf9c5e0ac3a6144d\",\"title\":\"Comparison of Three Nutritional Screening Tools with the New Glim Criteria for Malnutrition and Association with Sarcopenia in Hospitalized Older Patients\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The integrated assessment of nutritional status and presence of sarcopenia would help improve clinical outcomes of in-hospital aged patients. We compared three common nutritional screening tools with the new Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) diagnostic criteria among hospitalized older patients. To this, 152 older patients were assessed consecutively at hospital admission by the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), and the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002). A 46% prevalence of malnutrition was reported according to GLIM. Sensitivity was 64%, 96% and 47%, and specificity was 82%, 15% and 76% with the MUST, SGA, and NRS-2002, respectively. The concordance with GLIM criteria was 89%, 53% and 62% for the MUST, SGA, and NRS-2002, respectively. All the screening tools had a moderate value to diagnose malnutrition. Moreover, patients at high nutritional risk by MUST were more likely to present with sarcopenia than those at low risk (OR 2.5, CI 1.3-3.6). To conclude, MUST is better than SGA and NRS-2002 at detecting malnutrition in hospitalized older patients diagnosed by the new GLIM criteria. Furthermore, hospitalized older patients at high risk of malnutrition according to MUST are at high risk of presenting with sarcopenia. Nutritional status should be determined by MUST in older patients at hospital admission, followed by both GLIM and the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) assessment.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Clinical Medicine, Vol 9, Iss 1898, p 1898 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"nutritional status; sarcopenia; nutritional screening tools; hospitalized older patients; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"nutritional status; sarcopenia; nutritional screening tools; hospitalized older patients; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Francesco Bellanti; Aurelio Lo Buglio; Stefano Quiete; Giuseppe Pellegrino; Micha\\u0142 Dobrakowski; Aleksandra Kasperczyk; S\\u0142awomir Kasperczyk; Gianluigi Vendemiale\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/jcm9061898\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c376fe03de00461e77bee872350b81218dd50b13c94f0b4f1026c35736e13490\",\"relevance\":53},{\"id\":\"6f5737f19e01658aed0b0560d888913c946484e7a5091b252f5cc66b99f07ed1\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2020\\/8545281; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2314-4904; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2314-4912; 2314-4904; 2314-4912; doi:10.1155\\/2020\\/8545281; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/812eeb3f3a04464c9b68e0fe37b002c4\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2020\\/8545281; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/812eeb3f3a04464c9b68e0fe37b002c4\",\"title\":\"Sustainable and Dynamic Competitiveness towards Technological Leadership of Industry 4.0: Implications for East African Community\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The war to technology and economic powers has been the driver for industrialization in most developed countries. The first industrial revolution (industry 1.0) earned millions for textile mill owners, while the second industrial revolution (industry 2.0) opened the way for tycoons and captains of industry such as Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, and J.P. Morgan. The third industrial revolution (industry 3.0) engendered technology giants such as Apple and Microsoft and made magnates of men such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Now, the race for the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0) is on and there is no option, and every country whether developed or developing must participate. Many countries have positively responded to industry 4.0 by developing strategic initiatives to strengthen industry 4.0 implementation. Unlocking the country\\u2019s potential to industry 4.0 has been of interest to researchers in the recent past. However, the extent to which industry 4.0 initiatives are being launched globally has never been divulged. Therefore, the present study aimed at exploring industry 4.0 initiatives through a comprehensive electronic survey of the literature to estimate the extent of their launching in different regions. Inferences were drawn from industry 4.0 initiatives in developed nations to be used as the recommendations for the East African Community. Results of the survey revealed that 117 industry 4.0 initiatives have been launched in 56 countries worldwide consisting of five regions: Europe (37%), North America (28%), Asia and Oceania (17%), Latin America and the Caribbean (10%), and Middle East and Africa (8%). The worldwide percentage was estimated as 25%. This revealed that there is a big gap existing between countries in the race for industry 4.0.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Engineering, Vol 2020 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Engineering (General).

Given the need to involve all healthcare settings, including hospitals, in joint efforts to curb the opioid epidemic, it is essential to understand if clinicians perceive hospitals as contributors to the problem. Therefore, we examined clinical perspectives on the role of hospitals in the opioid epidemic. Methods We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 23 clinicians from 6 different acute care hospitals that are part of a single healthcare system in the Midwestern United States. Our participants were hospitalists (N = 12), inpatient registered nurses (N = 9), and inpatient adult nurse practitioners (N = 2). In the interviews, we asked clinicians whether hospitals play a role in the opioid epidemic, and if so, how hospitals may contribute to the epidemic. We used a qualitative thematic analysis approach to analyze coded text for patterns and themes and examined potential differences in themes by respondent type using Dedoose software. Results The majority of clinicians believed hospitals contribute to the opioid epidemic. Multiple clinicians cited Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\\u2019 (CMS) reimbursement policy and the Joint Commission\\u2019s report as drivers of inappropriate opioid prescribing in hospitals. Furthermore, numerous clinicians stated that opioids are inappropriately administered in the emergency department (ED), potentially as a mechanism to facilitate discharge and prevent re-admission. Many clinicians also described how overreliance on pre-populated pain care orders for surgical (orthopedic) patients, may be contributing to inappropriate opioid use in the hospital. Finally, clinicians suggested the following initiatives for hospitals to help address the crisis: 1) educating patients about negative consequences of using opioids long-term and setting realistic pain expectations; 2) educating medical staff about appropriate opioid prescribing practices, particularly for patients with complex chronic conditions (chronic pain; opioid use disorder (OUD)); and 3) strengthening the hospital leadership efforts to decrease inappropriate opioid use. Conclusions Our findings can inform efforts at decreasing inappropriate opioid use in hospitals.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Health Services Research, Vol 20, Iss 1, Pp 1-11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Hospital; Opioid epidemic; Perceptions; Clinician; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"Hospital; Opioid epidemic; Perceptions; Clinician; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Olena Mazurenko; Barbara T.

In this country, a regular faculty development (FD) program aimed at training faculty in instructing (teaching and assessing) these CC had operated. However, leadership was not emphasized. In a new intervention module, the roles and associated responsibilities of clinical instructors to conduct, design, and lead CC-based education were emphasis. Aims This follow-up explanatory case study compares the effectiveness of intervention module with that of the previous regular module. Methods The regular group (n = 28) comprised clinical instructors who participated in the FD module during the 2013\\u20132014 year while the intervention group (n = 28) was composed of 2015\\u20132016 participants. Prior to the formal (hands-on) training, participants in the intervention group were asked to study the online materials of the regular module. These participants then received a 30-h hands-on training in conducting, designing, and leading skills. Finally, they prepared a 10-h reflective end-of-module presentation of their real-world practices. Results Following the training, a higher degree improvement in participants self-reported familiarity with CC education, self-confidence in their ability to deliver CC education and sustained involve CC education were noted among the intervention FD group, compared with the regular FD group. In the intervention group, senior academicians (associate and full professor) are more substantially involved in designing and leading CC-based courses than junior academicians (lecturers and assistant professors). Among non-teaching award winners of in the intervention FD group, the follow-up degree of sustained involvement in delivering, designing and leading CC-based courses was significantly higher than that of the regular group.

Little research has examined the quality of panel discussions and how effectively they are facilitated. Methods Here, we present a mixed-method analysis of data from a survey of reviewers focused on their perceptions of the quality, effectiveness, and influence of panel discussion from their last peer review experience. Results Reviewers indicated that panel discussions were viewed favorably in terms of participation, clarifying differing opinions, informing unassigned reviewers, and chair facilitation. However, some reviewers mentioned issues with panel discussions, including an uneven focus, limited participation from unassigned reviewers, and short discussion times. Most reviewers felt the discussions affected the review outcome, helped in choosing the best science, and were generally fair and balanced. However, those who felt the discussion did not affect the outcome were also more likely to evaluate panel communication negatively, and several reviewers mentioned potential sources of bias related to the discussion. While respondents strongly acknowledged the importance of the chair in ensuring appropriate facilitation of the discussion to influence scoring and to limit the influence of potential sources of bias from the discussion on scoring, nearly a third of respondents did not find the chair of their most recent panel to have performed these roles effectively. Conclusions It is likely that improving chair training in the management of discussion as well as creating review procedures that are informed by the science of leadership and team communication would improve review processes and proposal review reliability.\",\"published_in\":\"Research Integrity and Peer Review, Vol 5, Iss 1, Pp 1-9 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Bias; Communication; Discussion; Grant applications; Innovation; Leadership; General Works; A\",\"subject\":\"Bias; Communication; Discussion; Grant applications; Innovation; Leadership; General Works; A\",\"authors\":\"Stephen A.

The objective of this project was to construct a consensus on core competencies of faculty to develop a faculty development curriculum in a Japanese family medicine context. Methods In 2015, a private FD initiative in the Mie University initiated a curriculum development in collaboration with FD fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh. A literature review and subsequent Delphi process were conducted for core competency development. Based on the core competency list, we designed and implemented a 2\\u2010year part\\u2010time FD curriculum from 2016. A course evaluation using pre\\u2010post confidence level was held during March 2017. Results Twenty\\u2010eight objectives were defined in five core domains: 1) care management\\/family medicine principle, 2) leadership\\/professional development, 3) administrative\\/management, 4) teaching, and 5) research\\/scholarly activity.

This study focused on the area of the classroom environment and teacher-student interpersonal behavior to see the relationship between each variable with learning achievement, and the relationship between the two variables. By using a sample of 160 X-university students majoring in mathematics and then using the Chi-Square test method with a contingency table to determine the relationship between each variable and learning achievement. Then using the Pearson correlation method the relationship between classroom environment with the teacher-student interpersonal behavior was tested. Based on the analysis and calculation of the research conducted, it can be concluded that the classroom environment has a good relationship with learning achievement in the mathematics major and general subjects. Whereas the teacher-student interpersonal behavior shows a positive relationship with learning achievement in the dimensions of leadership, understanding, and friendly\\/helping but a negative relationship in the dimensions of strictness and disatisfaction. In the mathematics major, the dimensions of uncertainty and admonishing are negatively related to learning achievement, but not for general subjects.

Twenty-five years after the concept of emotional intelligence was introduced, it still captures the attention of scholars, practitioners, educators, and the public alike. Questions regarding how EI should be defined and measured, with different approaches both to theory and measurement, are still relevant. Emotional intelligence is usually analysed from two different perspectives \\u2013 the ability models or mixed models. While the ability models focus on an individual's mental abilities to apply information provided by emotions for the improvement of cognitive processing, mixed models conceptualize EI as the combination of mental abilities, stable behavioural traits and personality variables. This volume presents theoretical and empirical papers that address a variety of topics. Two review papers cover new and important themes: the mechanisms of emotional intelligence using a computational approach, and the question on how to transversely develop emotional intelligence through school subjects. Research papers investigate several topics: the relationships between measures of EI and transformational leadership; the effect of the implicit theories of EI and of ability and trait EI on students\\u2019 academic achievement; the relationship between perceived emotional intelligence, burnout, work engagement, and job satisfaction in Italian schoolteachers; the developmental changes in EI abilities during early adolescence; and the effects of short-term emotional intelligence training on preschool teachers. Four papers are dedicated to methodological themes: dealing with an ongoing problem of EI measurement, especially its cross-cultural effects: comparing differential item functioning procedure in traditional back translation of the questionnaire with the native translator version; measurement invariance of the Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Emotional Competence Questionnaire across five different countries (Slovenia, Russia, Croatia, India, and the Czech Republic); the psychometric properties of the Vocabulary of Emotions Test (VET) in Serbian context; construction and validation of the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire \\u2013 Children\\u2019s form (ESCQ-C). We hope that this special issue will broaden knowledge in this field and raise further questions about emotional intelligence construct. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the authors who contributed to this thematic issue, and to academic reviewers. We also thank editor-in-chief and editorial board for their support and assistance.\",\"published_in\":\"Psychological Topics, Vol 29, Iss 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Tamara Mohori\\u0107; Vladimir Tak\\u0161i\\u0107; John Pellitteri\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/175943c2eb2f45b2bcd875e7772adb6f\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"0cdbcc60e132e646bbea4cbb74f3a9375bcedc9e99e4e9a70b853e0535589282\",\"relevance\":44},{\"id\":\"da6dff7d11c3c00b55d70989325e635915e2579d720b971266636a23feea7206\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/1660-4601\\/17\\/11\\/3765; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1661-7827; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1660-4601; doi:10.3390\\/ijerph17113765; 1660-4601; 1661-7827; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/37530a7dbe8f43908ddfbdd075f3d122\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17113765; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/37530a7dbe8f43908ddfbdd075f3d122\",\"title\":\"A Scoping Review of Capacity-Building Efforts to Address Environmental Justice Concerns\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Environmental justice (EJ) efforts aimed at capacity building are essential to addressing environmental health disparities; however, limited attention has been given to describing these efforts.

Literature published in peer-reviewed journals from January 1986 through March 2018 were included, and community capacity theory was applied as a framework for understanding the scope of capacity-building and community change strategies to address EJ concerns. Paired teams of independent analysts conducted a search for relevant articles ( n = 8452 citations identified), filtered records for content abstraction and possible inclusion ( n = 163) and characterized selected studies ( n = 58). Most articles implemented activities that were aligned with community capacity dimensions of citizen participation (96.4%, n = 53), community power (78%, n = 45), leadership (78%, n = 45), and networks (81%, n = 47); few articles identified a direct policy change (22%, n = 13), and many articles discussed the policy implications of findings for future work (62%, n = 36).

The type of this research is descriptive and verification research. The population in this research consists of employees from Bank SyariahBukopin, Bank BNI Syariah, and Bank JabarBantenSyariah. Sampling technique used in this research is non-probability sampling using a saturated sample technique. This research uses multiple regression employing more than one independent variable, namely person-organization fit (X1) and job satisfaction (X2). While the dependent variable is the turnover intention (Y). The results of this research show that turnover intention is significantly and simultaneously influenced by person-organization fit and job satisfaction variables of 37.50%. While the rest 62.50% is influenced by other variables outside this research. They are possibly organizational commitment, employee engagement, social support, change management, leadership, organizational behavior, and others. It is thus implied that there are many other potential variables which may affect employee turnover intention. Partially, the results of this research show that the person-organization fit does not affect turnover intention. However, job satisfaction affects turnover intention quite significantly. Thus, the better the job satisfaction is, the higher the turnover intention becomes.\",\"published_in\":\"Proceedings on Engineering Sciences, Vol 2, Iss 2, Pp 107-118 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"person-organization fit; job satisfaction; turnover intention; Engineering (General).

As a result, several studies across different organisational\\/occupational contexts and climes have examined and unanimously proven that ethical leadership was positively related to ethical climate. However, there is rarely any of these studies that was conducted in teaching context. Besides, the mechanisms involved between ethical leadership and ethical climate seems not to have been addressed in literature. Thus, this paper reports the findings of a study that investigated the mediating role of perceived leader integrity in the ethical leadership\\u2013ethical climate relationship among teachers. Methods Data were collected from 336 teachers (105 male and 231 female) in three-time periods using measures of ethical leadership, perceived leader integrity, ethical climate, and demographics. Results The results from OLS regression-based path analysis showed that: 1) ethical leadership was positively related to perceived leader integrity, 2) perceived leader integrity was positively related to ethical climate, 3) ethical leadership was positively related to ethical climate, and 4) the positive relationship between ethical leadership and ethical climate was mediated by perceived leader integrity. Conclusions The current study extends the social learning theory by identifying perceived leader integrity as a mechanism underlying the relationship between ethical leadership and ethical climate.

The results of the present study contribute to the better understanding of the inner experiences of TL by subordinates working as customer service specialists in the context of organizational changes.\",\"published_in\":\"Business: Theory and Practice, Vol 21, Iss 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"transformational leadership; subordinate; experience; manager; qualitative study; phenomenological analysis; Business; HF5001-6182\",\"subject\":\"transformational leadership; subordinate; experience; manager; qualitative study; phenomenological analysis; Business; \",\"authors\":\"Jolanta Sondait\\u0117; Greta Keidonait\\u0117\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3846\\/btp.2020.11113\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a17dd85651a0b4adc137ade74467a71e0f39f9b65af428b48215d98c308bb400\",\"relevance\":37},{\"id\":\"4428446fca09b5c4323bbd76168692872049a29b0ccef980b6b60572af7915d0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2071-1050\\/12\\/11\\/4556; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2071-1050; doi:10.3390\\/su12114556; 2071-1050; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7dc47cb168844214ac1ab48c6c877d88\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su12114556; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7dc47cb168844214ac1ab48c6c877d88\",\"title\":\"Multivariable Supplier Segmentation in Sustainable Supply Chain Management\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Pressure from stakeholders for sustainable development is forcing top management to reconsider its supply chain management. This form of sustainability must consider the risks, insecurities, and lack of proximity caused by any event on the global economy. Organizations must identify and manage the risks of every link in the chain, while pursuing sustainable development. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainable development must be the result of a deliberate and coordinated response by the entire organization. A suitable segmentation of suppliers allows development strategies to be prioritized. This article presents the steps that should be followed in supply chain management, the identification of risks, and the new leadership of purchasing management to develop a sustainable supply chain. To this end, some of the key industrial actions reported in the literature are outlined, and two case studies are presented to identify the steps for the segmentation and dynamic development of suppliers.

This essay considers four main challenges into which veterinarians are increasingly being drawn, as they respond to increasing public expectation for them to be scientific and moral authorities in animal welfare in addition to their traditional role as trusted health experts. They include: (1) to go beyond traditional conceptions of health by adopting a holistic view that also considers animal welfare, not only disease treatment; (2) to reimagine their professional duties when it comes to disease prevention at the intersection of animal-human-ecosystem health; (3) to develop core competencies\\/proficiency in animal welfare science and ethics in order to navigate discourses concerning competing priorities and socio-political ideologies and to provide professional leadership in animal welfare; (4) to provide feedback on novel networked devices, monitoring technologies and automated animal welfare solutions and their impact on animals\\u2019 welfare. To competently navigate the intricacies of the socio-political and connected world as trusted authorities and conduits for innovation in and through animal welfare, veterinarians and veterinary students are encouraged to: (a) develop core competencies in veterinary ethics, animal welfare science and deliberative capacities that are well-informed by current multidisciplinary frameworks, such as One Health; (b) engage interested parties in more effective collaboration and ethical decision-making in order to address animal welfare related concerns within their immediate sphere of influence (e.g., in a given community); and (c) participate in the process of engineering and technological design that incorporates animals\\u2019 welfare data (such as their preferences) for real-time animal monitoring through adding animal scientific and values-aware evidence in information technology systems. In order to tackle these challenges, four pillars are suggested to help guide veterinarians and the veterinary profession.

Little research focuses on practical capacity building strategies and monitoring. Our paper looks into involving stakeholders in facilitated group discussions as a specific strategy for fostering capacity building processes. These processes focused on physical activity (PA) promotion in two German communities (ACTION4men). Along the dimensions of capacity building suggested in literature (e.g., problem solving, resource mobilization, leadership), we implemented two participatory stakeholder groups (1\\/community). These groups were motivated to develop and implement PA interventions for men >50 years. For measuring capacity building processes, a semi-standardized monitoring instrument was used to document all group meetings. Additionally, we conducted semi-standardized interviews with group participants and drop-outs to capture their perspectives on capacity building. All documents were analyzed using thematic analysis. We successfully established stakeholder groups that planned and implemented a range of local measures meant to increase PA among older men. In one community, the process was sustainable, whereby the group continued to meet regularly over years. Capacity building was successful to a certain degree (e.g., regarding participation, problem assessment, and resource mobilization), but stalled after first meetings. Capacity building processes differed between the two communities in terms of leadership and sustainability. The developed interventions mainly addressed the access to organized sport courses, rather than tackling walkability or active transport. The theoretical capacity building approach was successful to develop and implement programs aimed at promoting PA. The actual capacity building processes depend upon the composition of stakeholder groups and inherent power relations.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 2306, p 2306 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"physical activity; men; community capacity; capacity building; setting approach; health promotion; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"physical activity; men; community capacity; capacity building; setting approach; health promotion; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Julika Loss; Nicola Brew-Sam; Boris Metz; Helmut Strobl; Alexandra Sauter; Susanne Tittlbach\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17072306\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"4d996b3c51b2f39b15fdd0a504652f74689c904df2a6cea9cc8310bfd01d344c\",\"relevance\":32},{\"id\":\"cb8564a3f89416979d1b12afc28cd8ff134dc6e0fe3f16b9705eed3d3980bf3d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2071-1050\\/12\\/7\\/2676; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2071-1050; doi:10.3390\\/su12072676; 2071-1050; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5c03325efe88464e9b43463593ce087e\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su12072676; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5c03325efe88464e9b43463593ce087e\",\"title\":\"Leadership Styles of Rural Leaders in the Context of Sustainable Development Requirements: A Case Study of Commune Mayors in the Greater Poland Province, Poland\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In the context of sustainable and durable development postulates, local leadership and rural governance is a matter of particular importance.

Such a manner of governance is the essence of transformational leadership, which, according to the multifactor model developed by Bass and Avoilo, facilitates the achievement of positive organizational and social results. The authors\\u2019 research is an attempt to answer the question about the style of governance adopted by the political leaders of rural communes in Poland and its links with their engagement in social activation and the use of participatory tools. A survey was conducted on a sample of 49 commune mayors from the Greater Poland Province (43%) using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and a questionnaire about public participation developed by the authors. The results indicate that components of transactional leadership predominate among commune mayors from the Greater Poland Province. Transformational leadership, which is largely based on the leader\\u2019s charisma, is exhibited much less frequently. At the same time, the majority of commune mayors use only the most basic forms of participation, without going beyond the requirements specified in the provisions of the law.

One of the practical ways to make supply chains more sustainable is for enterprises to utilize green innovation strategies and to increase resource reuse. In this work, we focus on a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer, and a collector. In the investigated CLSC, the manufacturer and the retailer drive the green innovation strategy either individually or simultaneously to boost market demand. In the reverse flow of the CLSC, the collector is responsible for collecting consumers\\u2019 used products and transferring them to the manufacturer for remanufacturing. By combining two types of the market leadership and three types of green innovation strategies, we establish six different Stackelberg game models and solve them analytically. Through an extensive comparative analysis, we show who should have market leadership and who should drive the green innovation strategy in the CLSC. Various numerical examples are also given to support our major findings. One of our key findings suggests that the supply chain members must participate in green innovation activities at the same time to achieve a win-win scenario in the CLSC.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 2274, p 2274 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"recycling; green innovation effort; power structure; closed-loop supply chain; game theory; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"recycling; green innovation effort; power structure; closed-loop supply chain; game theory; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Dooho Lee\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17072274\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"30e4d9af11076116702b5683dee97fdde5046a25c29a1535506a8b7f0b2cd378\",\"relevance\":30},{\"id\":\"4e18bec39babffba70a6a3a6966047dc0a844dde2ace7ef241e7654ff59e630e\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1186\\/s12913-020-05147-z; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1472-6963; doi:10.1186\\/s12913-020-05147-z; 1472-6963; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7efdefa878764f118e47aaaa675c2509\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12913-020-05147-z; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7efdefa878764f118e47aaaa675c2509\",\"title\":\"What will it take? Using an implementation research framework to identify facilitators and barriers in implementing a school-based referral system for sexual health services\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Across the United States, sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy rates are alarmingly high among youth. Schools, due to their proximity and access to youth, can increase student access to sexual health services (SHS) by creating referral systems (RS) to link students to school- and community-based SHS. From 2013 to 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s Division of Adolescent and School Health funded 17 Local Education Agencies (LEA) to partner with priority schools and stakeholders to develop and implement RS to increase student access to SHS. Cicatelli Associates Inc. (CAI) was funded to provide capacity-building to LEA. In 2016\\u20132017, CAI conducted case studies at two LEA, both large and urban sites, but representing different geographical and political contexts, to elucidate factors that influence RS implementation. Methods Nineteen LEA and community-based healthcare (CBH) staff were interviewed in the Southeastern (n = 9) and Western U.S. (n = 10). Key constructs (e.g., leadership engagement, resources, state and district policies) across the five domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework guided the methodology and analysis. Qualitative data was analyzed using the Framework Method and contextual factors and themes that led to RS implementation were identified. Results Interviewees strongly believed that school-based RS can decrease STI, HIV and unintended pregnancy and increase students\\u2019 educational attainment. We identified the following contextual key factors that facilitate successful implementation and integration of an RS: enforcing state and district policies, strong LEA and CBH collaboration, positive school culture towards adolescent health, knowledgeable and supportive staff, leveraging of existing resources and staffing structures, and influential district and school building-level leadership and champions. Notably, this case study challenged our initial assumptions that RS are easily implemented in states with comprehensive SHS policies. Rather, our conversations revealed how districts and local-level policies can have significant impact and influence to impede or promote those policies. Conclusions Through the use of the CFIR framework, the interviews identified important contextual factors and themes associated with LEAs\\u2019 implementation barriers and facilitators. The study\\u2019s results present key recommendations that other LEA can consider to optimize integration of RS-related evidence-based practices, systems, and policies in their districts.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Health Services Research, Vol 20, Iss 1, Pp 1-12 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Consolidated framework for implementation science; School health; Implementation readiness; Implementation tools; Case study methods; Implementation science; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"Consolidated framework for implementation science; School health; Implementation readiness; Implementation tools; Case study methods; Implementation science; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Emily Leung; Kathryn J.

To learn how this promising new healthcare model works in an Australian setting we explored experiences of healthcare providers in outer urban Sydney, where a number of practices are transitioning from traditional Australian general practice models to incorporate elements of PCMH approaches. Methods We collected qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers working in a range of transitioning practices and thematically analysed the data. We interviewed 35 participants including general practitioners, practice managers and practice nurses from 25 purposively sampled general practices in western Sydney, Australia, seeking maximal variation in practice size, patient demographics and type of engagement in practice transformation. Results Interviewees described PCMH transformation highlighting the importance of whole of practice engagement with a shared vision; key strategies for transformation to PCMH models of care including leadership, training and supportive information technology; structures and processes required to provide team-based, data-driven care; and constraints such as lack of space and the current Australian fee-for-service general practice funding model. They also reported their perceptions of early outcomes of the PCMH model of care, describing enhanced patient and staff satisfaction and also noting fewer hospital admissions, as likely to reduce costs of care. Conclusions Our study exploring the experience of early adopters of PCMH models of care in Australia, informs the international movement towards PCMH models of care. Our findings provide guidance for practices considering similar transitions and describe the challenges of such transitions within a fee-for-service payment system.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Health Services Research, Vol 20, Iss 1, Pp 1-13 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Primary health care; Primary care; General practice; Patient Centred medical home; Continuity of patient care; Qualitative research; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"Primary health care; Primary care; General practice; Patient Centred medical home; Continuity of patient care; Qualitative research; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Christine Metusela; Tim Usherwood; Kenny Lawson; Lisa Angus; Walter Kmet; Shahana Ferdousi; Jennifer Reath\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12913-020-05123-7\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c009938a80d362e8b1b9cced134064561e91a0a01d589f8e0940a18ffd974ab6\",\"relevance\":28},{\"id\":\"ddd03dc63796872fde70ab65b180e0b04aea20a14dce65e518f8a865578fb084\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/1660-4601\\/17\\/8\\/2865; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1661-7827; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1660-4601; doi:10.3390\\/ijerph17082865; 1660-4601; 1661-7827; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6edeb7147aca4427954f17165a033e19\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17082865; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6edeb7147aca4427954f17165a033e19\",\"title\":\"Identifying the Roles of Healthcare Leaders in HIT Implementation: A Scoping Review of the Quantitative and Qualitative Evidence\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Despite major investment, health information technology (HIT) implementation often tends to fail. One of the reasons for HIT implementation failure is poor leadership in healthcare organisations, and thus, more research is needed on leaders\\u2019 roles in HIT implementation. The aim of the review was to identify the role of healthcare leaders in HIT implementation. A scoping review with content analysis was conducted using a five-step framework defined by Arksey and O\\u2019Malley. Database searches were performed using CINAHL, Business Source Complete, ProQuest, Scopus and Web of Science. The included studies were written either in English or Finnish, published between 2000 and 2019, focused on HIT implementation and contained leadership insight given by various informants. In total, 16 studies were included. The roles of healthcare leaders were identified as supporter, change manager, advocate, project manager, manager, facilitator and champion. Identifying healthcare leaders\\u2019 roles in HIT implementation may allow us to take a step closer to successful HIT implementation. Yet, it seems that healthcare leaders cannot fully realise these identified roles and their understanding of HIT needs enforcement.

The reasons are multi-factorial and include patient, practice, healthcare system and societal factors, such as multi-morbidity, the diversity of populations and innovations in medical care. Also, practice-related factors, like stressful patient-staff interactions, poor process management of waiting times and lack of leadership, play a role. This publicly funded study evaluates the effectiveness of the newly developed participatory, interdisciplinary, and multimodal IMPROVEjob intervention on improving job satisfaction among general practice personnel. The intervention aims at structural stress prevention with regard to working conditions and behavioural stress prevention for leaders and other practice personnel. Methods In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, a total of 56 general practices will be assigned to either (1) participation in the IMPROVEjob intervention or (2) the waiting-list control group. The IMPROVEjob intervention consists of the following elements: three workshops, a toolbox with supplemental material and an implementation period with regular contact to so-called IMPROVEjob facilitators. The first workshop, addressing leadership issues, is designed for physicians with leadership responsibilities only. The two subsequent workshops target all GP and non-physician personnel; they address issues of communication (with patients and within the team), self-care and team-care and practice organisation. During the 9-month implementation period, practices will be contacted by IMPROVEjob facilitators to enhance motivation. Additionally, the practices will have access to the toolbox materials online. All participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and follow up. The primary outcome is the change in job satisfaction as measured by the respective scale of the validated German version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ, version 2018). Secondary outcomes obtained by questionnaires and - qualitatively - by facilitators comprise psychosocial working conditions including leadership aspects, expectations and experiences of the workshops, team and individual efforts and organisational changes. Discussion It is hypothesised that participation in the IMPROVEjob intervention will improve job satisfaction and thus constitute a structural and behavioural prevention strategy for the promotion of psychological wellbeing of personnel in general practices and prospectively in other small and medium sized enterprises.

However, in common with other medical professions, there is no one broadly accepted definition of competence. Studies in nursing have revealed that practicing nurses may view newly qualified colleagues as lacking competence, leading to disillusionment with nursing training programmes. Similar studies are lacking in veterinary nursing, despite the profession having recently undergone a similar transition from workplace-based training to undergraduate education. Methods A mixed methods explanatory study surveyed 66 Irish registered veterinary nurses and 31 first year veterinary nursing students at two Irish third level institutions to obtain their views on what constitutes veterinary nursing competence and when veterinary nurses develop it. The surveys were followed by student focus groups and semi-structured one-on-one interviews with registered veterinary nurses. Content analysis was employed to analyse the surveys, while the focus groups and interview transcripts underwent thematic analysis. Results Students perceived competence primarily as the ability to provide patient care, and they expected it to develop close to the time of graduation. RVNs held a broader definition of competence, incorporating leadership skills and confidence as well as patient care provision. RVNs expected it to take approximately two years of workplace-based experience post-graduation for a veterinary nurse to develop competence. In addition, RVNs recognised that anxiety felt by many newly qualified veterinary nurses during this period could be attenuated by mentorship from more experienced colleagues. Conclusions Irish RVNs and veterinary nursing students perceive competence differently, similar to previous findings from the nursing profession. Educators and regulators should provide explicit descriptions of terms such as \\u2018competence\\u2019 to avoid confusion and possible disillusionment amongst veterinary nursing stakeholders.\",\"published_in\":\"Irish Veterinary Journal, Vol 73, Iss 1, Pp 1-15 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Veterinary nurse; Competence; Day-one competencies; Competency; Workplace; Experience; Veterinary medicine; SF600-1100\",\"subject\":\"Veterinary nurse; Competence; Day-one competencies; Competency; Workplace; Experience; Veterinary medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Karen Dunne; Bernadette Brereton; Vivienne Duggan; Deirdre P.

It is worth noting that the incidence of the disease is extremely high in the low- and middle-income nations, which are having multiple other competing public health priorities, a weak health-care delivery system, or ongoing humanitarian emergencies. South Sudan has been subjected to long-term conflicts, and with regard to measles, it has been reported that more than 4700 cases and 26 deaths have been reported in the nation since the disease outbreak began last year. Keeping this in mind and in order to avert fatal consequences and accomplish 95% vaccine coverage, the international welfare agencies have joined their hands together and initiated a vaccination drive to immunize 2.5 million children across the entire nation along with the provision of Vitamin A and deworming tablets. In conclusion, considering the fact that measles is vaccine preventable and every child deserves the right to receive the vaccine, it is high time that we take necessary steps to ensure political leadership, strengthening of health facilities, and involvement of the parents so that the planned vaccination campaign can accomplish the intended results in the conflict-affected South Sudan.\",\"published_in\":\"Medical Journal of Babylon, Vol 17, Iss 2, Pp 229-230 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"measles; south sudan; world health organization; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"measles; south sudan; world health organization; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Saurabh RamBihariLal Shrivastava; Prateek Saurabh Shrivastava\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.4103\\/MJBL.MJBL_9_20\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ea8d80b8dca465b0e35898ddb42700d5f754c3bb80baeb401741e14f4b9983bd\",\"relevance\":23},{\"id\":\"e21ae67eb0f7e65e3be736743d4c78237fef192513d5cf184fb82ecef1a1d4c0\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/rsd.unifei.edu.br\\/index.php\\/rsd\\/article\\/view\\/1141; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2525-3409; 2525-3409; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f2510b68decd4c1e8deea24c9381459e\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f2510b68decd4c1e8deea24c9381459e\",\"title\":\"Overload of nursing work through Nursing Activities Score as an evaluating tool\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The present study sought to identify the use of Nursing Activities Score (NAS) to evaluate the nursing work overload in national nursing studies.

Rates of testing for anaemia, HIV and syphilis among women attending antenatal services in Indonesia are low, despite its mandate in national guidelines and international policy. Methods Midwife-held antenatal care records for 2015 from 8 villages in 2 sub-districts within Cianjur district were reviewed, alongside the available sub-district Puskesmas (Community Health Centre) maternity and laboratory records. We conducted four focus group discussions with kaders (community health workers) (n = 16) and midwives (n = 9), and 13 semi-structured interviews with laboratory and counselling, public sector maternity and HIV management and relevant non-governmental organisation staff. Participants were recruited from village, sub-district, district and national level as relevant to role. Results We were unable to find a single recorded result of antenatal testing for HIV, syphilis or anaemia in the village (566 women) or Puskesmas records (2816 women) for 2015. Laboratory records did not specifically identify antenatal women. Participants described conducting and reporting testing in a largely ad hoc manner; relying on referral to health facilities based on clinical suspicion or separate non-maternity voluntary counselling and testing programs. Participants recognized significant systematic challenges with key differences between the more acceptable (and reportedly more often implemented) haemoglobin testing and the less acceptable (and barely implemented) HIV and syphilis testing. However, a clear need for leadership and accountability emerged as an important factor for prioritizing antenatal testing and addressing these testing gaps. Conclusions Practical solutions such as revised registers, availability of point-of-care tests and capacity building of field staff will therefore need to be accompanied by both funding and political will to coordinate, prioritize and be accountable for testing in pregnancy.\",\"published_in\":\"BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, Vol 20, Iss 1, Pp 1-11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Indonesia; Antenatal testing; HIV; Syphilis; Anaemia; Decentralisation; Gynecology and obstetrics; RG1-991\",\"subject\":\"Indonesia; Antenatal testing; HIV; Syphilis; Anaemia; Decentralisation; Gynecology and obstetrics; \",\"authors\":\"C.

The Islamization in Indramayu raises three main questions. The first question is, where was the arrival of Islam in Indramayu. Second, when is the appearance of Islam. Third, who has a role in the Islamization process. This research uses the historical method, which consists of four stages: heuristic, criticism, interpretation, and historiography. This method was then collaborated with Islamic social movement theory to analyze the ideology of leadership and movement mobility of the propagator group of Islam in Indramayu. The results showed that the arrival of Islam in Indramayu came from the port of Cimanuk. Then spread to various areas, including in the countryside. Second, Islam has been dating in Indramayu since the 15th century. Third, some communities play a role in Islamization in Indramayu. The communities were very influential until the 19th century. They consisted of the Arab community and the adherents of the tarekat, especially from Cirebon. The first order to develop was Syattariyah. Meanwhile, the Arabic community leader from Cirebon was Sayyid Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad Basy-Syaiban. He is a figure who originated from the Hadramaut in the early seventeenth century. Penelitian ini berbicara tentang proses islamisasi di Indramayu. Proses islamisasi di Indramayu memunculkan tiga pertanyaan utama. Pertanyan pertama adalah dari mama dan di mana kedatangan islam. Kedua, kapan waktu kedatangan Islam. Ketiga, siapa yang berperan dalam proses islamisasi. Untuk menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, penelitian ini menggunakan metode sejarah yang terdiri atas empat tahap: heuristic, kritik, interpretasi, dan historiografi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kedatangan Islam di Indramayu berasal dari pelabuhan Cimanuk. Kemudian menyebar ke berbagai daerah, termasuk di pedesaan. Kedua, Islam telah dating di Indramayu sejak abad ke 15. Ketiga, terdapat komunitas yang berperan dalam Islamisasi di Indramayu. Komunitas tersebut sangat berpengaruh sampai abad ke 19.

Insights for Capacity Strengthening in Ghana\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Introduction: District health managers (DHMs) play a pivotal role in the operation of district health systems in low\\u2014and middle income countries, including Ghana. Their capacity is determined by their competencies, but also by the organization and system in which they are embedded. The objective of this paper is to explore how district health management emerges from contextual, organizational, and individual factors in order to demonstrate that capacity strengthening efforts at district level need to transcend individual competencies to take on more systemic approaches.Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 21) were conducted to gain insight into aspects that affect district health management in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Interviews were conducted with DHMs (n = 15) from six different districts, as well as with their superiors at the regional level (n = 4) and peers from non-governmental organizations (n = 2). A thematic analysis was conducted by using an analytical approach based on systems theory.Results: Contextual aspects, such as priorities among elected officials, poor infrastructure and working conditions, centralized decision-making, delayed disbursement of funds and staff shortages, affect organizational processes and the way DHMs carry out their role. Enabling organizational aspects that provide DHMs with direction and a clear perception of their role, include positive team dynamics, good relations with supervisors, job descriptions, appraisals, information systems, policies and guidelines. Meanwhile, hierarchical organizational structures, agendas driven by vertical programs and limited opportunities for professional development provide DHMs with limited authority to make decisions and dampens their motivation. The DHMs ability to carry out their role effectively depends on their perception of their role and the effort they expend, in addition to their competencies. In regards to competencies, a need for more general management and leadership skills were called for by DHMs as well as by their superiors and peers.Conclusion: Systemic approaches are called for in order to strengthen district health management capacity. This study can provide national policy-makers, donors and researchers with a deeper understanding of factors that should be taken into consideration when developing, planning, implementing, and assessing capacity-building strategies targeted at strengthening district health management.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Public Health, Vol 8 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"management and leadership; capacity strengthening; district health systems; systems thinking; complex adaptive systems; low- and middle-income countries; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"management and leadership; capacity strengthening; district health systems; systems thinking; complex adaptive systems; low- and middle-income countries; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Anne Christine Stender Heerdegen; Jana Gerold; Samuel Amon; Samuel Agyei Agyemang; Moses Aikins; Kaspar Wyss\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpubh.2020.00270\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"475f0f9e5f4c4e310237c6d947c182d020cc46d80c81fdd0c78d04506cb2f378\",\"relevance\":18},{\"id\":\"d381260e18e828843eafef49876fa6f9ac9c0b8cf00896b5fdeabbf1439fefc5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.lww.com\\/jbjsoa\\/fulltext\\/10.2106\\/JBJS.OA.20.00045; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2472-7245; 2472-7245; doi:10.2106\\/JBJS.OA.20.00045; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/46bb14eba1d74f8ebe938e49c02d346d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.2106\\/JBJS.OA.20.00045; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/46bb14eba1d74f8ebe938e49c02d346d\",\"title\":\"Managing Resident Workforce and Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background:. The novel coronavirus and associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading throughout the world, with robust growth in the United States. Its drastic impact on the global population and international health care is swift, evolving, and unpredictable. The effects on orthopaedic surgery departments are predominantly indirect, with widespread cessation of all nonessential orthopaedic care. Although this is vital to the system-sustaining measures of isolation and resource reallocation, there is profound detriment to orthopaedic training programs. Methods:. In the face of new pressures on the finite timeline on an orthopaedic residency, the Emory University School of Medicine Department of Orthopaedics has devised a 5-pronged strategy based on the following: (1) patient and provider safety, (2) uninterrupted necessary care, (3) system sustainability, (4) adaptability, and (5) preservation of vital leadership structures. Results:. Our 5 tenants support a 2-team system, whereby the residents are divided into cycling \\u201cactive-duty\\u201d and \\u201cworking remotely\\u201d factions. In observation of the potential incubation period of viral symptoms, phase transitions occur every 2 weeks with strict adherence to team assignments. Intrateam redundancy can accommodate potential illness to ensure a stable unit of able residents. Active duty residents participate in in-person surgical encounters and virtual ambulatory encounters, whereas remotely working residents participate in daily video-conferenced faculty-lead, case-based didactics and pursue academic investigation, grant writing, and quality improvement projects. To sustain this, faculty and administrative 2-team systems are also in place to protect the leadership and decision-making components of the department. Conclusions:. The novel coronavirus has decimated the United States healthcare system, with an unpredictable duration, magnitude, and variability. As collateral damage, orthopaedic residencies are faced with new challenges to provide care and educate residents in the face of safety, resource redistribution, and erosion of classic learning opportunities. Our adaptive approach aims to be a generalizable tactic to optimize our current landscape.\",\"published_in\":\"JBJS Open Access, Vol 5, Iss 2, Pp e0045-e0045 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Orthopedic surgery; RD701-811\",\"subject\":\"Orthopedic surgery; \",\"authors\":\"Andrew M.

The University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCD CCC) was funded to integrate tobacco treatment into cancer care. Lessons learned from the UCD CCC are illustrated across a systems framework with the Cancer Care Continuum and by applying constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Findings demonstrate different motivational drivers for the cancer center and the broader health system. Implementation readiness across the domains of the Cancer Care Continuum with clinical entities was more mature in the Prevention domain, but Screening, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survivorship domains demonstrated less implementation readiness despite leadership engagement. Over a two-year implementation process, the UCD CCC focused on enhancing information and knowledge sharing within the treatment domain with the support of the cancer committee infrastructure, while identifying available resources and adapting workflows for various cancer care service lines. The UCD CCC findings, while it may not be generalizable to all cancer centers, demonstrate the application of conceptual frameworks to accelerate implementation for a sustainable tobacco treatment program. Key common elements that may be shared across oncology settings include a state quitline for an adaptable intervention, cancer committees for outer\\/inner setting infrastructure, tobacco quality metrics for data reporting, and non-physician staff for integrated services.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 3241, p 3241 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"tobacco cessation; cancer care continuum; implementation research; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"tobacco cessation; cancer care continuum; implementation research; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Elisa K.

The Chinese economic system is such that local government competition has become a key factor affecting regional green development under the current leadership. Based on the inter-provincial panel data of 30 provinces in mainland China from 1997 to 2017, this paper uses the total-factor non-radial directional distance function and slack-based measure data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) to measure the green development efficiency of the provinces. Additionally, it also uses the Malmquist\\u2013Luenberger (ML) index to decompose green development efficiency and analyzes its internal driving factors. Finally, taking environmental regulation as a mediating variable, this paper empirically analyzes the influence mechanism of local government competition on green development efficiency from three perspectives including growth competition, fiscal competition and investment competition. The study found that: the green development efficiency of Chinese regions showed a downward trend, with significant regional differences; technological progress is the key factor to improve the efficiency of green development, and its role gradually decreases from eastern to western and central regions; pure technical efficiency has become a bottleneck restricting the improvement of green development efficiency, while scale efficiency shows significant regional differences; the growth competition, fiscal competition and investment competition of local government all have a significant inhibitory effect on the efficiency of green development.

Simulation results suggested that agents with high values of talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility tended to be perceived as leaders by their peers. Results also showed that talkativeness may be the most significant and instantaneous predictor for leader emergence of the three investigated attributes: talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility. In terms of group performance, smaller groups may outperform larger groups regarding their problem-solving ability in the beginning, but their performance tends to be of no significant difference in a long run. These results match the empirical literature and offer a mechanistic, operationalized description of the collective leadership processes.\",\"published_in\":\"Complexity, Vol 2020 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Electronic computers.

Strategic leadership is widely assumed to be a responsibility that defaults to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). However, in practice, what most CEOs do is strategic management rather than strategic leadership. While strategic management does share key aspects of strategic leadership CEOs are expected to prioritize the managerial side over the leadership side. This is just one of the situations in which the board-room assumes the leadership role. This paper discusses how boards of directors conduct the process of strategic leadership in their organizations. In recent years there has been an increasing interest among scholars to understand how boards strategize from a behavioral point of view.

Methods Demographic data regarding chairpersons (CPs) and program directors (PDs) were obtained from publicly-available faculty listings and online sources, and included employment institution, residency training, fellowship training status, gender, and years of post-graduate experience. Research productivity was measured using the h-index and number of publications, obtained from Scopus. Characteristics of CPs and PDs were compared using statistical analysis. Results Cross-sectional data was obtained from a total of 27 CPs and PDs from 13 accredited OHNS training programs across Canada active on July 1, 2019. All academic leaders completed at least 1 year of fellowship training. Head and neck oncology represented 77% of CPs and 59% of academic leaders overall, while pediatric otolaryngology represented 43% of PDs. Females represented 11% of academic leaders. There was a significant association between location of residency training and employment, with 56% (15\\/27) of physicians working where they had trained (p = 0.001, Fisher\\u2019s exact test; \\u03c6 = 2.63, p = 0.001). On average, individuals with a graduate (Master\\u2019s) degree had a significantly higher H-index (17.7 vs 7.4, p = 0.001) and greater number of publications (106 vs. 52, p = 0.02). Compared to PDs, CPs had a significantly higher average h-index score (14.5 vs. 8.14, p = 0.04) and accrued more years of post-graduate experience (29.7 vs. 21.3 years, p = 0.008). There were no differences in the proportions of CPs and PDs with graduate degrees. There appeared to be a decline in research productivity beginning 3 years after academic appointment. Conclusions This cross-sectional overview of academic leaders in Canadian OHNS programs demonstrates the following key findings: 1) all leaders completed fellowship training; 2) head and neck surgical oncology was the most common fellowship training subspecialty; 3) leaders were likely to be employed at the institution where they trained; 4) a Master\\u2019s degree may be associated with increased research productivity; 5) there is a potential risk of decreased productivity after appointment to a leadership position; and 6) women are underrepresented in academic leadership roles.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, Vol 49, Iss 1, Pp 1-7 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Otolaryngology; Head & neck surgery; Leadership; H-index; Academic benchmark; Research productivity; Surgery; RD1-811\",\"subject\":\"Otolaryngology; Head & neck surgery; Leadership; H-index; Academic benchmark; Research productivity; Surgery; \",\"authors\":\"Terence Fu; Vincent Wu; Paolo Campisi; Ian J.

These core competencies are the critical competencies to be developed in specific areas. There are different core competencies for nurse managers, but none in the Spanish health system. The objective of this research is to identify the core competencies needed for nurse managers in the Spanish health system. The research was carried out using the Delphi method to reach a consensus on the core competencies and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine construct validity, reducing the dimensionality of a dataset by finding the causes of variability in the set and organizing them by importance. A panel of 50 experts in management and healthcare engaged in a four-round Delphi study with Likert scored surveys. We identified eight core competencies from an initial list of 51: decision making, relationship management, communication skills, listening, Leadership, conflict management, ethical principles, collaboration and team management skills. PCA indicated the structural validity of the core competencies by saturation into three components (\\u03b1 Cronbach >0.613): communication, leadership and decision making. The research shows that eight competencies must be developed by the nursing managers in the Spanish health system. Nurse managers can use these core competencies as criteria to develop and plan their professional career. These core competencies can serve as a guideline for the design of nurse managers\\u2019 development programs in Spain.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 3173, p 3173 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"nurse manager; competence; core competencies; governance; leadership; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"nurse manager; competence; core competencies; governance; leadership; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Alberto Gonz\\u00e1lez Garc\\u00eda; Arrate Pinto-Carral; Jes\\u00fas Sanz Villorejo; Pilar Marqu\\u00e9s-S\\u00e1nchez\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17093173\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"7902d3cdc41e34d13350fca36dc936b62ad4babb05e1ea2c51cde41307c86934\",\"relevance\":8},{\"id\":\"a54978b4c547fb3578736dca7db8ffceefbfc4bae2ed39dce2ed82289b1c853c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/ije\\/issue\\/53355\\/660474?publisher=deu; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1308-8173; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1308-8505; 1308-8173; 1308-8505; doi:10.24988\\/ije.202035110; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a635a73749114b009aa31ad238933c46\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24988\\/ije.202035110; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a635a73749114b009aa31ad238933c46\",\"title\":\"Paternalist Liderlik Beklentisi: Y Ku\\u015fa\\u011f\\u0131 \\u0130\\u015fletme \\u00d6\\u011frencileri \\u00dczerine Bir Ara\\u015ft\\u0131rma\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Bu \\u00e7al\\u0131\\u015fman\\u0131n temel amac\\u0131, Y Ku\\u015fa\\u011f\\u0131 bireylerin y\\u00f6neticilerinden Paternalist Liderlik davran\\u0131\\u015flar\\u0131 bekleyip beklemediklerinin tespit edilmesidir.

This research focuses on the CEO\\u2013TMT interface to explain how CEOs influence TMT characteristics, which in turn affects TMT outcomes. Based on social learning theory, this study examines the associations among CEO ethical leadership, TMT cohesion, and TMT creativity in a Chinese context using a total of 91 TMTs. To verify the reliability and validity of the constructs, a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were run. The results showed that the hypothetical model captured distinct constructs and fits the data well. A multistep regression method was used to test hypotheses. The results indicated that: (a) CEO ethical leadership has a positive effect on TMT creativity; (b) TMT cohesion plays a mediating role in the relationship between CEO ethical leadership and TMT creativity; and (c) power distance plays a moderating role in the relationship between CEO ethical leadership and TMT creativity. The greater the power distance, the weaker the positive relationship between CEO ethical leadership and TMT creativity. This study demonstrates the value of CEO ethical leadership and advocates the importance of establishing team cohesion and building a psychologically safe environment to motivate top managers within an organization to share information and knowledge to improve creativity.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"CEO ethical leadership; TMT cohesion; TMT creativity; power distance; top management team; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"CEO ethical leadership; TMT cohesion; TMT creativity; power distance; top management team; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Jinguo Zhao; Wei Sun; Shujie Zhang; Xiaohong Zhu\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00748\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5f5395da4023238397116bef4c60f945409edea5d5e4c24d2e7314ca1bb1d5c9\",\"relevance\":2},{\"id\":\"19cf0f4f2608b1e6aed3f2cd5588bc3730b41443cf1426dbcf838c718686c596\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.comparativepolitics.org\\/jour\\/article\\/view\\/1089; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2221-3279; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2412-4990; 2221-3279; 2412-4990; doi:10.24411\\/2221-3279-2020-10012; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/997dd8b5db024e9e97787d5fc6a0bcfe\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24411\\/2221-3279-2020-10012; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/997dd8b5db024e9e97787d5fc6a0bcfe\",\"title\":\"SOCIO-POLITICAL MEANINGS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SPAIN-CATALAN CONFLICT THROUGH THE PRISM OF TWITTER COMMUNICATIONS\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The purpose of this study is to analyze the social meanings of the network communicative activity of the parties of the Spanish-Catalan confl ict in a specific direction \\u2013 in discussions about tweets of leading EU politicians. The relevance of the presented study is determined, on the one hand, by the increased infl uence of social media on political life, and, on the other hand, by the need to understand political confl icts not only as confl icts of interest, but also as confl icts of social meanings and ideas. The article discusses and interprets the meanings of two social communities \\u0303 supporters of the independence of Catalonia and supporters of the unity of Spain, implied in the communication carried out using the social network Twitter. The analysis is based on an empirical study of twitter messages by the method of quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The main socio-political attitudes of the parties to the confl ict, expressed in remarks on tweets of representatives of the EU leadership, are examined. The time interval of the study covers two years \\u0303 from May 2017 to June 2019. Based on an analysis of the level of communication activity of network users, it was revealed that the supporters of the independence of Catalonia act as a more active and cohesive social community, compared with the supporters of the unity of Spain. They have clear ideas about the political situation in the country and the region, as well as expressed ideological principles. This allows us to conclude that there is a narrative of independent Catalonia formed in public opinion. However, the meanings concerning the problems of social relations in the country and the region, arising in the light of the requirements of independence, remain in the shadow of communication. The passive nature of the participation of supporters of the unity of Spain in network communication in this area, as well as the content of their remarks, indicates the absence of a formed social base of supporters of unity, both among the inhabitants of Catalonia and among the rest of the Spanish citizens. This may be due to ideological lag, in which supporters of the country's unity are guided by outdated ideological stereotypes that are not able to unite them into a real social community with a certain political worldview. According to the findings of the study, it is precisely the ideas of the parties to the confl ict about social relations in the country that are their weak link that does not allow reaching a new level of political compromise or consensus.\",\"published_in\":\"Sravnitel\\u02b9na\\u00e2 Politika, Vol 11, Iss 1, Pp 151-169 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"catalan crisis; social meanings; the independence movement of catalonia; supporters of the unity of spain; the european union; twitter communication; ideology; Political science (General); JA1-92\",\"subject\":\"catalan crisis; social meanings; the independence movement of catalonia; supporters of the unity of spain; the european union; twitter communication; ideology; \",\"authors\":\"N.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach \\u2013 A three-stage Delphi study with hotel industry human resource experts was conducted to identify the key trends and major challenges that will emerge in the next ten years and how leaders should deal with the challenges brought about by service robot technologies. Findings \\u2013 Results show that while service robots are anticipated to increase efficiency and productivity of hotel activities, they may also pose challenges such as high costs, skill deficits, and significant changes to the organizational structure and culture of hotels. Therefore, the anticipated applications and integration of robotic technology will require leaders of the future to carefully consider the balance between the roles of service robots and human employees in the guest experience, and to nurture a work environment that embraces open-mindedness and change. Originality\\/value \\u2013 This is the first type of study to examine hospitality leadership and human resource management in the context of robotized hotels.

Old definitions had to bring new persuasion into the field in order to compete among modern organizations. We can witness those changes firstly by analyzing how the meaning of an organizational culture has been changed over the previous decades from a very narrow function to a wide and meaningful definition including soft skills and psychological aspects. The most common reason why it happened is economic and technological growth and changes in demand which come along with it. Organizations must adapt to those changes; otherwise, consequences can be crucial. Organizational culture nowadays includes more supporting disciplines, and one of them is Human Resources Management (HRM). Organizational culture and Human Resources Management have been merged as supporting disciplines approximately in the late nineties. The meaning of that phenomena got even stronger when American psychologists admitted its relevance and supported the idea that organizational culture consists not only of an external context. HRM\\u2019s components, such as employee\\u2019s engagement, the management of cultural differences among parties, creative leadership, the identification of a specific and individual needs, etc., became relevant in shaping organizational culture in a modern organization. The article presents components which belong to the side of organizational culture as well as to the side of HRM and the most important relations between two disciplines and common components which glued those disciplines together. ; Organizacin\\u0117s kult\\u016bros vaidmuo per pastaruosius de\\u0161imtme\\u010dius i\\u0161augo kartu su darbo rinkos poky\\u010diais.

For a full-fledged, stable functioning of any political party, there is a need of the continuous link between its structural elements and society. Such connection can be done with the help of mass media, holding party congresses and forums, also we don\\u2019t need to forget about the common communication with voters, so-called \\u00abdoor-to-door\\u00bb communication. Actually, the last type of activity is usually conducted before and during the election campaign. And in order to maintain contact with voters regardless of the period of election campaigns, the political party creates an instrument that will function day after day, year after year. Therefore, special attention should be focused on the process of communication between the political party and the citizens through the institution of public reception centers. The political party\\u2019s main line, the direction of its progress and development are determined not only by the own aims of the political party\\u2019s leadership, but also by complicated problems in many spheres of society that need to be solved. In order to identify these problems, it is necessary to carry out explanatory work, to communicate with people, to support them, to do everything possible to solve issues at the local and state levels. Therefore, researches of the institution of public reception centers of political parties is very relevant and progressive, according to the dynamic nature of socio-political process development, the active participation of citizens in the information and communicative spaces and the political life of the state as a whole. The purpose of the research is to review the main theoretical aspects of the concept of \\u00abpublic reception centers\\u00bb in political parties, to analyze the main subjects of this communicative process, to identify the main directions of the institution of public reception centers work in political parties, to offer practical recommendations for improving the work of the institution of public reception centers in political parties. Methodology. In the course of research, the author is used such scientific methods as: observation, comparison, analysis, induction and deduction, modeling, as well as systemic and structural-activity approaches. Conclusions. The functioning of public reception centers of political parties is a promising direction of the activity of any political force. This is one of the most effective channels of political communication, which operates on an ongoing basis, even during the inter-election period. The employees of public reception centers not only cover the party\\u2019s activities, provide comments and explanations about the deputies\\u2019 work, but also deal with legal aid. Many parties with a clear organizational structure separate the public reception centers as special institution or department. So, direct real communication with the citizens is highly appreciated in the communicative process between the party and society, because this way is made possible to hear the most acute and painful problems, get valuable advices and perspective recommendations for building a strategy of political activity. Results of work. The author proposes to supplement the provisions on the work of the public reception centers with the following practical recommendations: 1) it is necessary to ensure the presence of a signboard on the reception centers, inside it is necessary to hang a party flag, certain information about the activities, achievements of deputies and ordinary members of the party, propaganda products; 2) to prepare and agree the working hours of the reception center, the hours of reception of deputies of local government establishments and deputies of Ukraine; 3) to inform the mass media and social networks about the location and procedure of work in reception centers; 4) it is necessary to choose employees for the work with citizens, preferably with legal education, because many issues have a legal direction; 5) to provide employees with high-quality office equipment and communications (landline telephone, mobile communication, Internet communication); 6) to involve actively local, state government establishments, as well as entrepreneurial structures, public, youth, charitable organizations, investors, social services to solve the problems of citizens promptly; 7) to conduct training seminars for public reception centers staff with the participation of professionals in the field of communication with people and psychologists, because the work with strange citizens requires a great moral and intellectual exclusion and tolerance. ;

Fust changes in the environment require further research into the effectiveness of the application of existing agile methodologies, knowledge systems and competencies of project managers and their leadership. The foundations of environmental change lie in changing the decision-making paradigm in agile project and programs management. The article explores modern approaches to leadership formation when applying agile methodologies of its specificity from decision-making processes in project management. The problems of leadership creation and development in the application of agile project management methodologies for the implementation of Agile transformation of organisation are considered. The studies were conducted based on a competency-based approach modelled by the International Project Management Association. The content model of competency of the leader applying agile management is presented. The Agile leadership and leadership behaviour patterns are formed in a project management behavioural competency system based on agile technology methods and tools. These competencies included: Self-reflection and self-management, Personal integrity and reliability, Personal communication, Relationships and interaction, Leadership, Teamwork, Conflicts and Crises, Resourcefulness, Negotiation, and Orientation to results. The patterns of project managers' behaviour as agile leaders in project product creation and agile project management are explored. The differences in the behaviour patterns of leaders and agile leaders were examined by behavioural competencies within the identified key competency indicators. Such patterns allowed the authors to identify bottlenecks in the application of agile project management methodologies in the context of the development for Agile transformation of organization. ;

In the context of geopolitical transformations in Central and Eastern Europe, the search for new mechanisms to strengthen international security remains relevant. To address this issue, one of the directions is to seek new forms and ways of developing international military cooperation. Based on the analysis of modern scientific literature and source base, the author has studied the prerequisites for the establishment of military cooperation between Ukraine, Poland and the Republic of Lithuania by the example of the formation of a multilateral military unit LITPOLUKRBRIG. The author pays special attention to the participation of the unit Armed Forces of Ukraine in joint activities with the armed forces of NATO member states to acquire interoperability to perform task for their intended purpose.It has been proved that the leading condition for the creation of the LITPOLUKRBRIG military unit was common interest of the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Poland and Ukraine in the field of ensuring international peace and security in Europe. At the same time, the conceptual approaches to establishing a joint peacekeeping military unit have changed depending on the activity of the military and political leadership of the states and their readiness to participate in ensuring international peace and security in the region and the world.The conducted study allows asserting that exchange of experience, obtaining of new theoretical and practical skills according to NATO standards during joint trainings (exercises), performance of peacekeeping (special) tasks promoted acquisition of abilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to joint action.At the same time, the authors periodization of the evolution of the conceptual fundamentals for the formation of a multilateral military unit LITPOLUKRBRIG was proposed and the prerequisites for each stage were described: the first stage (1992-1997); the second stage (November 1997-2009); the third stage (November 2009-2015).

Therefore, there is a need for scientific generalization of the indicated experience in the use of troops (forces) during the preparation and conduct of evacuation activities by sea and the development of naval art, as a theoretical basis for solving scientific and practical problemsThe purpose of the proposed article is to disclose and generalize the experience of preparing and conducting the evacuation of troops (forces) of the \\u201cwhite\\u201d movement and the civilian population from Odessa in February 1920 to use it in the process of improving the theory and practice of the activities of the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.The paper analyzes and explores the main causes and factors that directly affected the preparation and conduct of the Odessa evacuation of troops (forces) of the \\\"white\\\" movement and the civilian population by the sea in February 1920 and, as a result, affected its final results.The author focuses on the dependence of the results of the Odessa evacuation by sea in February 1920 on such factors as: the views of the leadership of the naval forces on the preparation and use of their forces; preparedness of the military command and control bodies, available fleet forces (including civilian forces) and the region to carry out evacuation tasks by sea; military-geographical conditions for the operation of naval forces, including the state and development of the equipment of the theater of operations; the composition and balance of power of the parties and the nature of the action of enemy forces. The paper highlights and describes the characteristic features of the preparation and conduct of evacuation measures, evaluates the results of their imple- mentation. ; \\u0423

determine the place and role of the court Masque of the Kings of the house of Stuart era in the political life of England in the first half of the 17th century, as well as to identify the level of influence of the court Masque on the values and priorities of the royal court, as well as the effect on strengthening the authority of the monarch.Research methodology. Twelve publications by leading English scholars on this subject were considered, including archival data and historical choirs. The materials of the specific literature were studied using logical, historical, chronological, problem-chronological and historical-retrospective methods.Results. The Court Masque became a model of the Renaissance culture, in which politics, aesthetics, culture, and history closely interacted.Masques were designed to emphasize the harmony, unity, and consolidation of English society. Thanks to the huge influence of the Masques on the political and cultural life of England, the Palace of Whitehall gradually turned into a world center of influence. Masques become a cult example of the Stuart era. The Court Masque becomes an intermediary between the crown and the court, a channel of communication between the monarch and his elites, performing auxiliary functions in maintaining the power of the Stuarts. Masques strengthened the authority of the King of England in the political arena and asserted his right to national leadership. The Masques sublimated the conflict into aesthetic harmony and submission to the will of the monarch, demonstrating the strengths of the royal Stuart house.Novelty. An attempt is made to analyze the works of leading researchers of the Renaissance, in order to identify the influence of the court Masque on the political culture of England.The practical significance. The key results of this research can be used in lecture materials, practical classes and seminars on the history of foreign culture. ; \\u0412\\u0438\\u0432\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u043e \\u0442\\u0430

The significance and conceptual provisions of pedagogical conditions for the formation of leadership qualities in students of economic universities are determined.A system of pedagogical conditions for the formation of leadership qualities among students of economic universities is singled out. The first pedagogical condition for the formation of leadership qualities among students of economic universities is the creation of an open educational environment for an economic university, which allows building an individual educational trajectory for each student and taking into account the specifics of the professional activity of a future specialist. The second pedagogical condition for the formation of leadership qualities among students of economic universities is the creation of a developing personality-oriented environment in the educational and extra-curricular interaction of students. Its technological arsenal includes methods and techniques that meet such requirements as: dialogicity; activity-creative character; orientation in support of individual development of the individual; providing the student with the necessary space, freedom to make independent decisions, creativity, choice of content and ways of doing things.The emphasis is on the development of a leadership paradigm through the organization of training work. The third pedagogical condition for the formation of leadership skills among students of economic universities is the introduction of a leadership paradigm through the organization of interactive forms of work (trainings) at the School of the Leader. It is described that the program of modular discipline \\\"Fundamentals of Leadership\\\" has been developed. \\\"Personal and professional efficiency. A series of trainings on leadership development for students of economic universities \\\"contains interactive group and individual tasks for obtaining, developing and improving personal leadership qualities. The purpose, tasks and principles of the implementation of a complex of trainings on the development of leadership qualities in the students of economic universities have been determined. Trainings on development of leadership qualities at students of economic universities \\\"Personal and professional efficiency\\\" are distributed by modules. The content, types and direction of training exercises of each module are described.It is emphasized that taking these principles into account allows each student to feel unique personality, to acquire the necessary leadership skills that will help him in communicating, co-operating, and self-development. ;

Nonetheless, leadership effectiveness has remained a multi-dimensional construct, and not many attempts have been made to conceptualise models in this area. Considering the case of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), the principal aim of the present study was to update and empirically support the traditional Contingency Model of Leadership Effectiveness in order to achieve a more credible model useful to contemporary organisations. It was observed that leader characteristics and hierarchy structure are not good determinants of leadership behaviour in the organisation. A final attempt was made to validate the Contingency Model of Leadership Effectiveness with the help of data gathered in the present study. Data validates the traditional model of leadership to a large extent; this is especially true for task-oriented leadership behaviour as opposed to relationship-oriented leadership behaviour. It is recommended that future researchers consider activity-based constructs for the measurement of variables to obtain more significant and validate critical relationships in the model. It is also recommended that ADNOC and other corporations in the region give equal attention to male and female employees and leaders. Females would particularly strive in positions where leader-subordinate relationships are critical for overall organisational success.

Design: A qualitative study using critical incident technique and a content analytic approach of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Setting: Maternity wards in 10 Norwegian hospitals with more than 200 registered births annually were included in the study. Participants: A purposeful sample of 33 midwives with more than two years\\u2019 working experience described 57 adverse incidents. Findings: Maternity ward managers utilised four types of practices to support midwives after critical incidents: management, transformational leadership, distributed leadership and laissez-faire leadership. Key conclusions and implications for practice: The study shows that proactive managers who planned for how to handle critical incidents provided midwives with needed individual support and learning. Proactive transformational leadership and delegating roles for individual support should be promoted when assisting second victims after critical incidents. Managers can limit the potential harm to second victims by preparing for the eventuality of a crisis and institute follow-up practices. ; This work was supported by grants from Telemark Hospital Trust and Norwegian midwife and Nurses Association. ; publishedVersion Adverse incidents; Midwives; Second victims; Critical incident stress debriefing; Follow-up practices; Front line management 0266-6138 ; 1532-3099 R\\u00f8nningstad, Chris; Christoffersen, Line; Teigen, Janne\"},{\"id\":\"5ad5a8d51021f797089699c6f12cbc3fe1b8d9eebbb2fb5931047d946a5c9c61\",\"content\":\"Creating community resilience: theatre for young audiences and the mental health crisis The authors explore the assertion that TYA in schools can play a significant role in addressing the mental health crisis affecting young people in the UK, with implications globally.

The purpose of this research was to obtain evidence of the validity of the internal structure of the Morale Questionnaire used by the Spanish Armed Forces in military operations overseas. Two subsamples of 250 Spanish soldiers deployed on an international mission in Lebanon participated in the study. The questionnaire was applied at the beginning and at the end of the mission, respectly. The results obtained throughExploratory and Confirmatory Factorial Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling, allowed to assess the questionnaire statistically obtaining a tool that consists of 26 items, agglutinated in six factors. The theoretical dimensions of the original tool were mostly maintained.

The other necessity includes developing socio-political, socio-economic, ethically-spiritual and ecological environment. ; \\u041c\\u043e\\u0434\\u0435\\u0440\\u043d\\u0438\\u0437\\u0430\\u0446\\u0438\\u044f \\u0440\\u0430\\u0441\\u0441\\u043c\\u0430\\u0442\\u0440\\u0438\\u0432\\u0430\\u0435\\u0442\\u0441\\u044f \\u0432 \\u0441\\u0442\\u0430\\u0442\\u044c\\u0435 \\u043a\\u0430\\u043a \\u043f\\u043e\\u0442\\u0440\\u0435\\u0431\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u044c \\u043e\\u0431\\u0449\\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u0432\\u0438\\u0442\\u0438\\u044f, \\u0440\\u0430\\u0441\\u043a\\u0440\\u044b\\u0432\\u0430\\u044e\\u0442\\u0441\\u044f \\u0435\\u0435 \\u0441\\u0443\\u0449\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438 \\u0441\\u043e\\u0434\\u0435\\u0440\\u0436\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435, \\u0432\\u044b\\u0434\\u0435\\u043b\\u044f\\u044e\\u0442\\u0441\\u044f \\u0444\\u043e\\u0440\\u043c\\u044b \\u0438 \\u043e\\u0441\\u043e\\u0431\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438. \\u0414\\u043b\\u044f \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u0435\\u0434\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f \\u0443\\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0448\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u043c\\u043e\\u0434\\u0435\\u0440\\u043d\\u0438\\u0437\\u0430\\u0446\\u0438\\u0438 \\u0432 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0448\\u0435\\u0439 \\u0441\\u0442\\u0440\\u0430\\u043d\\u0435 \\u0442\\u0440\\u0435\\u0431\\u0443\\u0435\\u0442\\u0441\\u044f \\u043c\\u0430\\u0441\\u0448\\u0442\\u0430\\u0431\\u043d\\u043e\\u0435 \\u043e\\u0431\\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u043b\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435 \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0438\\u0437\\u0432\\u043e\\u0434\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0430, \\u0430 \\u0442\\u0430\\u043a\\u0436\\u0435 \\u043f\\u043e\\u0434\\u0433\\u043e\\u0442\\u043e\\u0432\\u043a\\u0430 \\u043a\\u0432\\u0430\\u043b\\u0438\\u0444\\u0438\\u0446\\u0438\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u044b\\u0445 \\u043a\\u0430\\u0434\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432, \\u0441\\u043f\\u043e\\u0441\\u043e\\u0431\\u043d\\u044b\\u0445 \\u043e\\u0431\\u0441\\u043b\\u0443\\u0436\\u0438\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u044c \\u0432\\u044b\\u0441\\u043e\\u043a\\u043e\\u0442\\u0435\\u0445\\u043d\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0433\\u0438\\u0447\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u043e\\u0435 \\u043e\\u0431\\u043e\\u0440\\u0443\\u0434\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435, \\u0443\\u043f\\u0440\\u0430\\u0432\\u043b\\u044f\\u044e\\u0449\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0440\\u0430\\u0431\\u043e\\u0442\\u043d\\u0438\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0432\\u0441\\u0435\\u0445 \\u0443\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u043d\\u0435\\u0439, \\u0438\\u043c\\u0435\\u044e\\u0449\\u0438\\u0445 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0443\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e-\\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u044b\\u0435 \\u0438 \\u043f\\u0440\\u0430\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0447\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0435 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0432\\u044b\\u043a\\u0438 \\u0443\\u043f\\u0440\\u0430\\u0432\\u043b\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f, \\u0437\\u043d\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f \\u043e\\u0441\\u043e\\u0431\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u0435\\u0439 \\u043e\\u0431\\u044a\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0430 \\u0443\\u043f\\u0440\\u0430\\u0432\\u043b\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f, \\u0443\\u043c\\u0435\\u044e\\u0449\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0440\\u0430\\u0431\\u043e\\u0442\\u0430\\u0442\\u044c \\u0441 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0443\\u0447\\u043d\\u044b\\u043c\\u0438 \\u0438 \\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u044b\\u043c\\u0438 \\u043e\\u0440\\u0433\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u0437\\u0430\\u0446\\u0438\\u044f\\u043c\\u0438, \\u043f\\u043e\\u0434\\u0434\\u0435\\u0440\\u0436\\u0438\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438 \\u0444\\u043e\\u0440\\u043c\\u0438\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u044c \\u0442\\u0432\\u043e\\u0440\\u0447\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u0443\\u044e \\u0430\\u0442\\u043c\\u043e\\u0441\\u0444\\u0435\\u0440\\u0443 \\u0441\\u0440\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438 \\u043f\\u043e\\u0434\\u0447\\u0438\\u043d\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u044b\\u0445. ;

Exploring the associations between motivation, transformational leadership, and innovation in a religious organization Religious organizations are social systems operating in a complex and changing environment. By looking to an authority beyond themselves, religious organizations have comparatively little control over defining their own goals. In this juggling between sticking to the ultimate goal of an organization and adapting to complex changing environments, that is, in the juggling between tradition and renewal, transformational leadership seems to play an important role in religious organizations. The extensive body of literature on transformational leadership has focused more on the outcomes of transformational leadership than on its antecedents. We extend the existing literature by linking managers' motivation to their transformational leadership behaviors in a religious organization. More specifically, we examined the associations of intrinsic and prosocial motivation with transformational leadership, and we investigated the relationship between transformational leadership and innovation among 252 managers in the largest nonprofit organization in Norway, the Church of Norway. Analyses in structural equation modeling revealed a positive relationship between intrinsic motivation and transformational leadership, whereas the relationship between prosocial motivation and transformational leadership was not significant. Transformational leadership was positively associated with innovation. Based on the results of the study, we discuss practical implications regarding how to support intrinsic motivation, transformational leadership, and innovation in religious organizations. ; publishedVersion intrinsic motivation; innovation; prosocial motivation; religious organizations; transformational leadership; indre motivasjon; innovasjon; prososial motivasjon; religi\\u00f8se organisasjoner; transformasjonsledelse 1-21 ; Nonprofit Management & Leadership L\\u00f8vaas, Beate Jelstad; Jungert, Tomas; Van den Broeck, Anja; Haug, H\\u00e5vard\"},{\"id\":\"a80659835db790e2c345e45288613fd4a332adcf6ff21fa2a18470c2b68ff2a0\",\"content\":\"Mother's social status is associated with child health in a horticulturalist population High social status is often associated with greater mating opportunities and fertility for men, but do women also obtain fitness benefits of high status? Greater resource access and child survivorship may be principal pathways through which social status increases women's fitness. Here, we examine whether peer-rankings of women's social status (indicated by political influence, project leadership, and respect) positively covaries with child nutritional status and health in a community of Amazonian horticulturalists. We find that maternal political influence is associated with improved child health outcomes in models adjusting for maternal age, parental height and weight, level of schooling, household income, family size, and number of kin in the community. Children of politically influential women have higher weight-for-age (B = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.12\\u20130.54), height-for-age (B = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.10\\u20130.54), and weight-for-height (B = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.04\\u20130.44), and they are less likely to be diagnosed with common illnesses (OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.31\\u20130.76). These results are consistent with women leveraging their social status to enhance reproductive success through improvements in child health. We discuss these results in light of parental investment theory and the implications for the evolution of female social status in humans.

This statement is proved by literature analysis, where frugality and frugal innovations are presented as a determinant of sustainable development. However, in most of the cases the lack of empirical evidence of this situation can be noticed. The article includes a review of the literature describing frugal innovation. In the article, the definitions of frugal innovations are compared with some empirical propositions for frugality measuring in the companies. The aim of the paper is to describe the issue of frugal innovation, its definitions, manifestations and ways of measuring. The reason of conducting the study is a desire of verification how deep is the issue analysed in the literature. In order to achieve the aim of the paper, the following objectives have been set: (1) to discuss current definitions of frugal innovations; (2) to present the ways how frugal innovations can be manifested; (3) to describe current propositions of frugal innovation measures and to discuss if can they be used to measure frugal innovation efficiency in the companies. The analysis is based on literature review. First of all, there is presented the method of the study and detailed description of the research sampling process. Presentation of frugal innovation definitions is the second step of the study. The next step is to show the most common manifestations of frugal innovations. Considerations about these two elements are the causes of identifying the measures, which helps to assess the efficiency of frugal innovations. The study confirms that there is still a huge demand for deeper investigation of the issue, because the current literature does not provide the comprehensive understanding of it.

This unsustainability is not caused by a financial crisis, but is caused by its own design and initial conception. For this, the case of Sweden is shown as an example; and the policies adopted by this Nordic country to correct the unsustainability of the welfare state mentioned above.Design\\/methodology\\/approach: The applied methodology has been, on the one hand, a literary review of the welfare state concept. On the other hand, an analysis has been carried out with various economic indicators that serve to corroborate the aforementioned unsustainability and the effect of the decisions taken by Sweden.Research and practical limitations\\/implications: The analysis ofeconomic variables such as GDP or the collection of taxes on GDP is burdened with the classical limitation on the cause-effect relationship. The problem of causality in economics is one of the most significant in the discipline. This problem is fundamental in historical analyses, when it comes to relating a phenomenon that has occurred with the causes that generated it.Originality: The debate about the welfare state and its sustainability is gaining strength from very different spheres. In an unstable and highly globalised economic environment, the role that states must play in theeconomy is being reformulated. The present paper analyses the development and growth of the welfare state as one of the differential elements of the developed economies (especially in the Western European area), and its subsequent crisis and loss of legitimacy due to its financial unsustainability.Findings: This article shows how the introduction of private companies that provide public services can be a solution to the welfare state crisis. For this, the Swedish case is used as an example. In the Nordic country,it was found that the introduction of private companies in the provision of public services has not reduced social assistance services or their quality. What is important, it has been a new competitive management, which guarantees the quality of the services provided, at a lower cost to the public sector budget.Paper type: theoretical paper. welfare state; crisis of welfare state; Swedish model; civil society Journal of Corporate Responsibility and Leadership; Vol 5, No 4 (2018): Innovations in Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Management; 27-44 ; 2392-2699 ; 2392-2680 N\\u00e1\\u00f1ez Alonso, Sergio Luis\"},{\"id\":\"22512ec20cdede891d83ba387c9e3df2e1757f7087177207dfe6cd953c46d1bb\",\"content\":\"Public Investment Management of Higher Education in Vietnam : Current Issues and Policy Recommendations Purpose: The aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensive insight on public investment management practices in higher education and experiences of developed countries, to analyse the current approaches to public investment management in Vietnam and to propose applicablepolicy recommendations.Design\\/methodology\\/approach: Case study based on literature of public investment in higher education and analysis of legal documents, reports and data regarding Vietnam\\u2019s current practices in the field.Findings: Public investment management practices of Vietnam still follow the traditional approach, which has shown various weaknesses and drawbacks in terms of efficiency, lack of unification, and incapability of higher education institutions to seek for autonomy and alternative operational resources.Research and practical limitations\\/implications: Lack of quantitative data and survey tools to enhance the practical implementation of the study.Originality\\/value: This paper can become a reference resource for policy makers in terms of promoting reforms in the public investment system for higher education in the future.Paper type: Case study. higher education; public investment; public investment management; higher education funding Journal of Corporate Responsibility and Leadership; Vol 5, No 4 (2018): Innovations in Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Management; 45-66 ; 2392-2699 ; 2392-2680 Lan, Le Ngoc; Trang, Vu Minh\"},{\"id\":\"e03cca5385bf44597a9880ce784144d9a23cc05a99cdbc03f2b69ace2fc35b87\",\"content\":\"The Multi-Outlook Socialism Concept of the PAX Association as Estimated by the Central State Security Organs of People\\u2019s Poland under W\\u0142adys\\u0142aw Gomu\\u0142ka and Edward Gierek (1956\\u20131980) ; Koncepcja socjalizmu wielo\\u015bwiatopogl\\u0105dowego Stowarzyszenia \\u201ePAX\\u201d w ocenie centralnych organ\\u00f3w bezpiecze\\u0144stwa Polski Ludowej w okresie rz\\u0105d\\u00f3w W\\u0142adys\\u0142awa Gomu\\u0142ki i Edwarda Gierka (1956\\u20131980) The PAX Association under the leadership of Boles\\u0142aw Piasecki sought to create a party of Catholics on their political bases.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES Purpose: The purpose of the study was to identify the internal development determinants of Polish companies in the USA, considering the character of their activity, i.e. splitting them into two business sectors \\u2013 traditional industries and new technologies.Methodology: The research has been conducted using a mail survey method among Polish companies in the USA. As a result, 19 properly filled survey questionnaires were returned.Findings: The findings of the research indicated that Polish companies see major determinants of development in the USA in internal factors, including applied technology, innovative products\\/services, organisation of production processes\\/services and management skills. Slight differences in the answers of companies representing both groups (traditional industries and new technologies) mainly concerned the strength of impact of particular assets. For companies in the new technologies group, most important growth determinants were, above all, used technology and innovation of products\\/services, while companies operating in traditional industries found the strongest positive impact in leadership, competences of the management staff and organisation culture.Implications: Both the research results and the very fact of involvement in foreign investments in such competitive environment demonstrate that Polish companies are aware of the strength of their assets. Just as enterprises from the developed countries, they benefit from ownership advantages on foreign markets. These are not, however, cost advantages attributed to companies from the emerging markets in the subject literature, but those perceived as the domain of the companies from the developed countries.Originality: This paper concerns a still insufficiently defined problem of foreign direct investments of companies from mid-range emerging economies in developed countries.Keywords: foreign direct investment, internationalisation, internal development determinants, foreign subsidiaries, Central and Eastern EuropePaper type: Research paper foreign direct investment; internationalisation; internal development determinants; foreign subsidiaries; Central and Eastern Europe Journal of Positive Management; Vol 9, No 4 (2018); 3-15 ; 2392-1412 ; 2083-103X Kuczmarska, Magdalena\"},{\"id\":\"cd4fc21a01c009c7f7dd15eab70ad1bf1c60798cbb1d0f3ac7bbe902c5614a34\",\"content\":\"Principal component analysis of financial statements. A compositional approach \\/\\/ An\\u00e1lisis en componentes principales de los estados financieros. Un enfoque composicional Financial ratios are often used in principal component analysis and related techniques for the purposes of data reduction and visualization. Besides the dependence of results on ratio choice, ratios themselves pose a number of problems when subjected to a principal component analysis, such as skewed distributions. In this work, we put forward an alternative method drawn from compositional data analysis (CoDa), a standard statistical toolbox for use when data convey information about relative magnitudes, as financial ratios do. The method, referred to as the CoDa biplot, does not rely on any particular choice of financial ratio but allows researchers to visually order firms along the pairwise financial ratios for any two accounts. Non-financial magnitudes and time evolution can be added to the visualization as desired. We show an example of its application to the top chains in the Spanish grocery retail sector and show how the technique can be used to depict strategic management differences in financial structure or performance, and their evolution over time. ; Las ratios financieras se utilizan a menudo en el an\\u00e1lisis en componentes principales y t\\u00e9cnicas relacionadas con el fin de reducir y visualizar los datos.

A global movement is underway to harness the power of coordinated state policy to address the significant and interrelated challenges of environmental degradation, climate change, poverty, and energy insecurity. In May 2019 a grassroots coalition comprising a range of civil society groups\\u2014scientists, labour unions, Indigenous peoples, and youth\\u2014launched the Pact for a Green New Deal (PGND) in Canada, with more than 150 town hall meetings across the country. Participants called for 100% renewable energy, phase out of the oil sands, a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030, and the creation of 1 million new green jobs and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples [1]. A significant reorientation to the scale and direction of government expenditure, as happened in the American New Deal of the 1930s, can spur technical innovation but can also exacerbate inequalities. A Canadian green transition is significant globally given its high energy production, exports, and internal use. In this perspective piece we examine the transformative potential of a Canadian PGND by focusing on the social and political characteristics of energy infrastructure: the potential for 100% renewable energy, transitions for oil sands, energy democracy, Indigenous energy leadership, gender equity, and energy poverty. The actor coalitions emerging from these then forge specific energy transition pathways, whether just and inclusive, or not. The Canadian case highlights the complexities and opportunities that accompany countries with large geographies, fraught geo-political histories, strong federalism, inequalities of access to clean affordable energy, and an abundance of renewable energy.

Current models of precision oncology practice include specialized clinics or consultation services based on a molecular tumor board (MTB) approach. MTBs are comprised of interprofessional teams of clinicians and scientists who evaluate tumors at the molecular level to guide patient-specific targeted therapy. The practice of precision oncology utilizing MTB-based models is an emerging approach, transforming precision genomics from a novel concept into clinical practice.

Data collected and analyzed in the study were: interviews with program directors, focus groups and interviews with faculty members, program documentation and information on websites, and on-site program observations. This paper extends the findings of this study and the themes identified in it. These themes were as follows: 1) varied understandings of IPE, 2) diverse IPE learning activities within curricula, 3) the requirement for support and resources for IPE and research, 4) student participation and leadership in IPE, and 5) limited IPE evaluation (Author names removed for integrity of review process, 2019). In this paper, the themes are explored in further depth through extensive consideration of documentation provided by the involved universities.

In light of the centrality of universal health coverage (UHC) in driving current health policy, we sought to examine the value interests that influence agenda setting in the country\\u2019s health financing space. Given the plurality of Kenya\\u2019s health policy levers, we aimed to examine how the perspectives of stakeholders involved in policy decision-making and implementation shape discussions on health financing within the UHC framework. Methods A series of in-depth key informant interviews were conducted at national and county level (n = 13) between April and May 2018. Final thematic analysis using the Framework Method was conducted to identify similarities and differences amongst stakeholders on the challenges hindering Kenya\\u2019s achievement of UHC in terms of its the optimisation of health service coverage; expansion of the population that benefits from essential healthcare services; and the minimisation of out-of-pocket costs associated with health-seeking behaviour. Results Our findings indicate that the perceived lack of strategic leadership from Kenya\\u2019s national government has led to a lack of agreement on stakeholders\\u2019 interpretation of what is to be understood by UHC, its contextual values and priorities. We observe material differences between and within policy networks on the country\\u2019s priorities for population coverage, healthcare service provision, and cost-sharing under the UHC dispensation. In spite of this, we note that progressive universalism is considered as the preferred approach towards UHC in Kenya, with most interviewees prioritising an equity-based approach that prioritises better access to healthcare services and financial risk protection. However, the conflicting priorities of key stakeholders risk derailing progress towards the expansion of access to health services and financial risk protection. Conclusions This study adds to existing knowledge of UHC in Kenya by contextualising the competing and evolving priorities that should be taken into consideration as the country strategises over its UHC process. We suggest that clear policy action is required from national government and county governments in order to develop a logical and consistent approach towards UHC in Kenya.

Malaria control tools are efficacious and effective in preventing the disease; however, the human behaviour aspect of the intervention strategies is weak due to heavy reliance on positive human health behaviour. The challenge lies in adoption of control interventions by the target population which, to an extent, may include access to prevention and treatment tools. We present a qualitative assessment of the use of the Health Animator (HA) model for Information, Education and Communication (IEC) to improve adoption and use of malaria control by promoting positive health behaviours. Results We conducted 3 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and 23 individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) with HAs. Each FGD consisted of 8 participants. Data was analysed using QSR International NVivo 10 software. There are four main themes emerging regarding HA experiences. The perceptions include; collaborative work experience, personal motivation and growth, community participation with health animation and challenges with implementation. Results suggest that HAs were pleased with the training as they gained new information regarding malaria, which affected their use of malaria control interventions within their families. Knowledge was well assimilated from the trainings and influenced personal growth in becoming a community leader. Support from the leadership within the village and the health system was important in legitimising the main messages. The community responded positively to the workshops valued the information imparted. The voluntary nature of the work in a poverty-stricken community affected sustainability. Conclusions There is need to empower communities with strategies within their reach. Functioning traditional social support structures are a crucial element in sustainability. Voluntarism is also key for sustainability, especially for rural and remote communities with limited sources of income.

The proposed model, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, includes psychosocial factors (transformational leadership, workgroup identification, and shared understanding) and organizational factors (knowledge sharing opportunities and formalization of knowledge sharing processes) as antecedents of individuals' attitudes, perception of subjective norms associated with their group and their direct supervisor, and intention and effective knowledge-sharing behavior. Methods: the model was statistically tested using structural equation modeling techniques with data provided by 131 customer service employees of a large Brazilian telecommunications company. Results: the results indicate that the psychosocial elements have a strong influence on knowledge sharing attitudes and practices. The hypotheses associated with behavioral control have not been confirmed. Moreover, the intention to share knowledge does not seem to be affected by the subjective norms associated with the individual's direct supervisor, but only by those related to their group. Conclusions: the cognitive proximity between group members, reflected in their perception of shared understanding, was an important element in the elicitation of attitudes favorable to knowledge sharing. Additionally, individuals with greater identification with their group tended to have more positive attitudes toward sharing their knowledge. This attitude tends to be more positive when the individual's direct supervisor adopts a more transformational leadership style. The influence of leaders seems to extend from the development of a culture of knowledge exchange and diffusion of principles that stimulate this exchange, to the creation of opportunities to share knowledge through the active management of knowledge diffusion in their teams. compartilhamento de conhecimento; teoria do comportamento planejado; lideran\\u00e7a transformacional; identifica\\u00e7\\u00e3o; entendimento compartilhado; Management.

First, we analyzed what the effect of transformational leadership and procedural justice on trust in the organization and sustainable organizational identity is. Secondly, we examined the mediator effect on organizational trust, in addition to the effects of transformational leadership and procedural justice on sustainable organizational identity. The sample of the study consists of 558 subjects from Turkey, 106 subjects from Azerbaijan, and 95 subjects from Kyrgyzstan\\u2014a total of 759 subjects. To analyze the collected data, we used correlation analysis, regression analyses, and ANOVA testing. For these analyses, we used the SPSS statistical software. The results indicate that transformational leadership and procedural justice positively and significantly affect manager trust. Moreover, manager trust has a positive and significant impact on creating a sustainable organizational identity. The results of the regression analyses further show that in the relationship between transformational leadership and procedural justice with sustainable organizational identity, there is a full effect of mediation on the perception of manager trust. Moreover, there is an indirect relationship among transformational leadership and procedural justice with creating a sustainable organizational identity, and this relationship is established through the perception of manager trust. The results of the study suggest that an efficient way to increase the trust of managers by employees is to increase procedural justice and to follow a transformational leadership style in the workplace. Moreover, it is expected that corporations following these strategies can sustain their organizational identity. transformational leadership; procedural justice; manager trust; sustainable organizational identity; mediating variables; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350 Sustainability, Vol 12, Iss 6, p 2278 (2020) Serhat Erat; Hakan Kitap\\u00e7\\u0131; K\\u00fcltigin Ak\\u00e7in\"},{\"id\":\"a6438fd4340acb024df0efcd7d761c392c01860bacecfd454bce75206ff1c8a9\",\"content\":\"Research on the Relationship Between Safety Leadership, Safety Attitude and Safety Citizenship Behavior of Railway Employees The daily operation and maintenance work of railways are very dangerous. Railway employees often have safety accidents while working, and the safety citizenship behavior (SCB) of railway employees can effectively reduce the accident rate. Therefore, it is of great significance to identify the main safety constructs affecting the SCB of railway employees to minimize accidents. This paper puts forward a supposed model of the influence mechanism of safety leadership (SL) on employee SCB through the mediation of safety attitude (SA). A questionnaire was used with railway employees, and 238 valid responses were finally collected. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to explore the relationship between SL, SA and SCB. The results showed the SL is positively related to the SA, and it can further promote the SCB of railway employees. In addition, SA has a positive impact on employee SCB. safety leadership; safety attitude; safety citizenship behavior; structural equation model; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 6, p 1864 (2020) Mengjie Li; Huaiyuan Zhai; Junjie Zhang; Xiangcheng Meng\"},{\"id\":\"28e0436aae9db4bd9e4a54e1d304b811fe978069a2ab670ccc754ed3971a117c\",\"content\":\"Successful international communication A key concern of international businesses of today is how they can manage communication across borders, especially when using English as a lingua franca.

In Colombia, poverty is one of those causes present mainly in rural areas where one in 10 children suffers from malnutrition. Methodology We searched ScienceDirect, PubMed, ClinicalKey, and SciELO for references on child malnutrition, its social determinants, and elements for its intervention in Colombia. Results The review allowed us to identify that many factors influence this problem determined not only by the lack of food but also by other factors such as poverty, lack of resources, restricted access to health care, rising prices of essential foods, political conflicts leading forced displacement, drought, the absence of an equity-based policy approach, poor environmental sanitation, among others. Conclusions Child malnutrition should not be conceived as mainly a food-related problem. Other factors that influence this problem should also be taken into account in order to prevent it. Trained personnel should be deployed to intervene in the social determinants that underpin child malnutrition. Thus, in Colombia, the family physician is a fundamental link in the health system, responsible for providing comprehensive medical care and for the leadership of the newly introduced health model based on primary health care. social determinants of health; childhood; child malnutrition; poverty; human rights; equity; primary health care; colombia; Medicine; R; Medicine (General); R5-920 Medwave, Vol 20, Iss 02, Pp e7839-e7839 (2020) M\\u00f3nica Vargas; Erwin Hern\\u00e1ndez\"},{\"id\":\"26ee9e43c1b517c32cd39b423286880d7636862ab1b27fafd88dee945f571fb8\",\"content\":\"Leading Teachers\\u2019 Emotions Like Parents: Relationships Between Paternalistic Leadership, Emotional Labor and Teacher Commitment in China Emotional labor plays an essential role in school leadership and teaching, as principals and teachers undergo complex interactions with students, colleagues, and parents.

The progress of an organization depends on the extent to which the leader can bring the organization to achieve organizational goals. What emerges is the quality of foreign workers (expatriates). Many expatriates have quality and competences under local workers. The aim of this study is to know and analyze the problem of foreign workers, whether they are capable of working in accordance with competence since many positions as expatriates occupy leaders or managers. The research method uses a qualitative approach with respondents of local workers who have ever been led by expatriates and locals. The approach used in this study is a qualitative approach; the sampling method uses purposive sampling. The result of this study reveals that local leaders are more effective (than expatriate ones) due to the same culture and language.

Researchers from different fields such as Psychology, Medicine, Educational sciences, Economy and Business embrace the notion of Spiritual Intelligence. Nevertheless, it is considered as one of the most controversial and highly debated notions. The first section of this study gives a brief overview of the essential theoretical framework including definitions and theories related to Spiritual Intelligence. In the second section, we present a layered approach of Spiritual Intelligence based on the corresponding layered models of Knowledge-Intelligence-Consciousness. The results of this study showed that Spiritual Intelligence constitutes the backbone of every subsystem of human intelligence as it integrates, matures and transforms every physical, intellectual, and emotional ability and leads to the highest forms of self-awareness, self-knowledge and consciousness. The realization of our true Self, of our hidden and highest potentialities is tied inseparably with the hierarchical organization of knowledge through metacognition and executive functions. Specifically, higher order forms of self-observation, self-regulation through attentional, emotional and impulse control, problem solving, mental flexibility and adaptation could reveal our true and eternal identity.

This article reflects on the inclusion-moderation thesis, which asserts that parties from the radical right become like mainstream parties once they move from the opposition to government. This mainstreaming primarily occurs through the moderation of issue positions and the decline of populism. In this article, I focus on populism and consider the role of party leadership for government parties. I distinguish between traditional and managerial leadership. While traditional leadership employs an adversarial strategy toward mainstream parties, managerial leadership adopts an accommodative strategy. This article looks at three phases: 1) the opposition period; 2) in office under traditional party leadership; 3) in office under managerial party leadership. I expect that, compared to the second phase when the party is in office under traditional party leadership, levels of populism are higher during the opposition period and lower when it is in office under managerial party leadership.

I develop an inductive typology of these leadership dimensions and apply this framework to Trudeau and May\\u2019s tweets in 2018 and 2019. I find first that Trudeau is a much more active Twitter user than Theresa May was as prime minister, attesting to different leadership styles.

Trudeau is much more likely to use Twitter to portray himself as a non-political figure, while May is more likely to emphasize the role of policy \\u2018decider.\\u2019 Both prime ministers are framed much more often as national legislative leaders rather than party leaders or executives.

The literature has discussed many factors that affect the outcomes of forest devolution policies; however, insufficient attention has been paid to the role of exogenous socio-economic changes. Using the longitudinal case study method, we focus on how socio-economic changes affect the effectiveness of forest devolution policies using a case from Southeast China. We find that in this case, although forest devolution succeeded in granting farmers sufficient forest rights, it failed to incentivize farmers to contribute to managing forests because of the dramatic changes in socio-economic contexts. Economic development and outmigration reduced farmers\\u2019 dependence on forest income, elevated the costs of silvicultural operations, and posed market risks, thereby reducing farmers\\u2019 enthusiasm about managing forests; outmigration also weakened community leadership and impeded the collective action of making forest investments. Eventually, socio-economic changes compromised the positive stimulus caused by forest devolution and contributed to the collective action dilemma of managing forests after the reform. We argue that operationalizing forest devolution in developing countries needs to consider the exogenous socio-economic changes that may enhance or counteract the effects of devolution policies, and that more autonomy should be granted to communities to make policies adaptative to their local socio-economic dynamics. forest devolution; collective action; socio-economic change; forest tenure reform; outmigration; Agriculture; S Land, Vol 9, Iss 2, p 58 (2020) Zhang Yiwen; Shashi Kant; Hexing Long\"},{\"id\":\"eb861f880c616ba214f8b27d54419beedbefdd28167c489376eebdada3a7ce1d\",\"content\":\"Predicting Sustainable Employability in Swedish Healthcare: The Complexity of Social Job Resources Achieving sustainable employability (SE), i.e., when employees are able to continue working in a productive, satisfactory, and healthy manner, is a timely challenge for healthcare. Because healthcare is a female-dominated sector, our paper investigated the role of social job resources in promoting SE. To better illustrate the complexity of the organizational environment, we incorporated resources that operate at different levels (individual, group) and in different planes (horizontal, vertical): trust (individual-vertical), teamwork (group-horizontal), and transformational leadership (group-vertical). Based on the job demands-resources model, we predicted that these resources initiate the motivational process and thus promote SE. To test these predictions, we conducted a 3-wave study in 42 units of a healthcare organization in Sweden. The final study sample consisted of 269 professionals. The results of the multilevel analyses demonstrated that, at the individual level, vertical trust was positively related to all three facets of SE. Next, at the group level, teamwork had a positive link with employee health and productivity, while transformational leadership was negatively related to productivity. These findings underline the importance of acknowledging the levels and planes at which social job resources operate to more accurately capture the complexity of organizational phenomena and to design interventions that target the right level of the environment. sustainable employability; healthcare; female-dominated workplace; social job resources; trust; teamwork; job satisfaction; health; job performance; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 4, p 1200 (2020) Marta Roczniewska; Anne Richter; Henna Hasson; Ulrica von Thiele Schwarz\"},{\"id\":\"094f59e3da65b5e1f035150ce8e2ac7c3aee2e665846ed34f46a79bc7906f090\",\"content\":\"The Construction of the Great Synagogue in Stockholm, 1860\\u20131870: A Space for Jewish and Swedish-Christian Dialogues The construction of the Great Synagogue in Stockholm during the 1860s initiated Jewish communal debates on the position and public presence of Jews in the Swedish pre-emancipatory society.

After the global crisis of 2008\\u22122009, the world economy entered the era of restructuring. This article focuses on the risks that a new leader will face in the process of shaping the world economy. The methods employed in the research include big data processing of continuous change and the results of the symmetric macroeconomic analysis based on the statistics collected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), The Word Bank (WB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Central banks and Treasuries. The study results proved that the recessionary processes, their depth and global nature, are caused by a combination of world financial system crises and general civilization problems. These new systemic risks for the world economy might result in new global crises that will limit the resources of international financial institutions for sustainable development. Besides, for most banks these crises will mean shifting a big share of derivatives to the off-balance liabilities, using Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in deals, followed by an increase in state and corporate debts, trade wars, a slowdown of economic development in China, and widening contradictions between global and national finances. Regular research and systematization have developed certain guidelines for the global economic restructuring process. First of all, it is recommended on the base of interstate compromises to focus on international agreements to ensure a solid foundation for global finance. On the basis of the comparative analysis carried out for the USA, China and other counties, it was made clear that no one leader in world economy in 21st century views the world reserve as based on the currency of one country only. Instead, there will be a slow transition to using Special Drawing Rights (SDR) with a basket from 15\\u221220 currencies G20. world economy; nature of global crises; risks of the financial markets; leadership problem; Finance; HG1-9999 International Journal of Financial Studies, Vol 8, Iss 1, p 7 (2020) Viacheslav M.

Results Voice and accountability (\\u03b2 = \\u2212 0.60) and GNI per capita for females (\\u03b2 = \\u2212 0.33) were directly associated with a lower ECC prevalence. Political stability\\/absence of terrorism (\\u03b2 =0.40) and higher percentage of female legislators, senior officials and managers (\\u03b2 = 0.18) were directly associated with a higher ECC prevalence. Control of corruption (\\u03b2 = \\u2212 0.23) was indirectly associated with a lower ECC prevalence. Voice and accountability (\\u03b2 = 0.12) was indirectly associated with a higher ECC prevalence. Overall, voice and accountability (\\u03b2 = \\u2212 0.49), political stability\\/absence of terrorism (\\u03b2 = 0.34) and higher female GNI (\\u03b2 = \\u2212 0.33) had the greatest effects on ECC prevalence.

One aspect of the country\\u2019s global reorientation has been its increased interest in, and willingness to play a role in, global health. In the early 2010s, the UK Department for International Development (DFID) initiated a collaboration with the Chinese government on a programme to support the country to play a greater and more effective global role in health and explore how the UK and China could work together on issues of key concern and contribute to improved global development outcomes. The programme worked with key Chinese agencies to carry out capacity building, support analysis of China\\u2019s approaches to engagement in global health governance and assistance, and provide support to government decision making. It also trialled several small-scale interventions in third countries through which Chinese agencies gained experience of working on health programmes overseas. The article reports on the main findings of an evaluation commissioned by DFID to learn from the programme. The programme provided support at a key time in China\\u2019s global reorientation; however, there is a need for continued development of capacity and systems for China to play the role envisaged by the country\\u2019s leadership. There is also a need for continued exploration on the part of China and partners of how to effectively collaborate to support improved global outcomes.

We compared three common nutritional screening tools with the new Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) diagnostic criteria among hospitalized older patients. To this, 152 older patients were assessed consecutively at hospital admission by the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), and the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002). A 46% prevalence of malnutrition was reported according to GLIM. Sensitivity was 64%, 96% and 47%, and specificity was 82%, 15% and 76% with the MUST, SGA, and NRS-2002, respectively. The concordance with GLIM criteria was 89%, 53% and 62% for the MUST, SGA, and NRS-2002, respectively. All the screening tools had a moderate value to diagnose malnutrition. Moreover, patients at high nutritional risk by MUST were more likely to present with sarcopenia than those at low risk (OR 2.5, CI 1.3-3.6). To conclude, MUST is better than SGA and NRS-2002 at detecting malnutrition in hospitalized older patients diagnosed by the new GLIM criteria. Furthermore, hospitalized older patients at high risk of malnutrition according to MUST are at high risk of presenting with sarcopenia. Nutritional status should be determined by MUST in older patients at hospital admission, followed by both GLIM and the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) assessment. nutritional status; sarcopenia; nutritional screening tools; hospitalized older patients; Medicine; R Journal of Clinical Medicine, Vol 9, Iss 1898, p 1898 (2020) Francesco Bellanti; Aurelio Lo Buglio; Stefano Quiete; Giuseppe Pellegrino; Micha\\u0142 Dobrakowski; Aleksandra Kasperczyk; S\\u0142awomir Kasperczyk; Gianluigi Vendemiale\"},{\"id\":\"6f5737f19e01658aed0b0560d888913c946484e7a5091b252f5cc66b99f07ed1\",\"content\":\"Sustainable and Dynamic Competitiveness towards Technological Leadership of Industry 4.0: Implications for East African Community The war to technology and economic powers has been the driver for industrialization in most developed countries. The first industrial revolution (industry 1.0) earned millions for textile mill owners, while the second industrial revolution (industry 2.0) opened the way for tycoons and captains of industry such as Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, and J.P. Morgan. The third industrial revolution (industry 3.0) engendered technology giants such as Apple and Microsoft and made magnates of men such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Now, the race for the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0) is on and there is no option, and every country whether developed or developing must participate. Many countries have positively responded to industry 4.0 by developing strategic initiatives to strengthen industry 4.0 implementation. Unlocking the country\\u2019s potential to industry 4.0 has been of interest to researchers in the recent past. However, the extent to which industry 4.0 initiatives are being launched globally has never been divulged. Therefore, the present study aimed at exploring industry 4.0 initiatives through a comprehensive electronic survey of the literature to estimate the extent of their launching in different regions. Inferences were drawn from industry 4.0 initiatives in developed nations to be used as the recommendations for the East African Community. Results of the survey revealed that 117 industry 4.0 initiatives have been launched in 56 countries worldwide consisting of five regions: Europe (37%), North America (28%), Asia and Oceania (17%), Latin America and the Caribbean (10%), and Middle East and Africa (8%). The worldwide percentage was estimated as 25%. This revealed that there is a big gap existing between countries in the race for industry 4.0. Engineering (General).

Given the need to involve all healthcare settings, including hospitals, in joint efforts to curb the opioid epidemic, it is essential to understand if clinicians perceive hospitals as contributors to the problem. Therefore, we examined clinical perspectives on the role of hospitals in the opioid epidemic. Methods We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 23 clinicians from 6 different acute care hospitals that are part of a single healthcare system in the Midwestern United States. Our participants were hospitalists (N = 12), inpatient registered nurses (N = 9), and inpatient adult nurse practitioners (N = 2). In the interviews, we asked clinicians whether hospitals play a role in the opioid epidemic, and if so, how hospitals may contribute to the epidemic. We used a qualitative thematic analysis approach to analyze coded text for patterns and themes and examined potential differences in themes by respondent type using Dedoose software. Results The majority of clinicians believed hospitals contribute to the opioid epidemic. Multiple clinicians cited Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\\u2019 (CMS) reimbursement policy and the Joint Commission\\u2019s report as drivers of inappropriate opioid prescribing in hospitals. Furthermore, numerous clinicians stated that opioids are inappropriately administered in the emergency department (ED), potentially as a mechanism to facilitate discharge and prevent re-admission. Many clinicians also described how overreliance on pre-populated pain care orders for surgical (orthopedic) patients, may be contributing to inappropriate opioid use in the hospital. Finally, clinicians suggested the following initiatives for hospitals to help address the crisis: 1) educating patients about negative consequences of using opioids long-term and setting realistic pain expectations; 2) educating medical staff about appropriate opioid prescribing practices, particularly for patients with complex chronic conditions (chronic pain; opioid use disorder (OUD)); and 3) strengthening the hospital leadership efforts to decrease inappropriate opioid use. Conclusions Our findings can inform efforts at decreasing inappropriate opioid use in hospitals.

In this country, a regular faculty development (FD) program aimed at training faculty in instructing (teaching and assessing) these CC had operated. However, leadership was not emphasized. In a new intervention module, the roles and associated responsibilities of clinical instructors to conduct, design, and lead CC-based education were emphasis. Aims This follow-up explanatory case study compares the effectiveness of intervention module with that of the previous regular module. Methods The regular group (n = 28) comprised clinical instructors who participated in the FD module during the 2013\\u20132014 year while the intervention group (n = 28) was composed of 2015\\u20132016 participants. Prior to the formal (hands-on) training, participants in the intervention group were asked to study the online materials of the regular module. These participants then received a 30-h hands-on training in conducting, designing, and leading skills. Finally, they prepared a 10-h reflective end-of-module presentation of their real-world practices. Results Following the training, a higher degree improvement in participants self-reported familiarity with CC education, self-confidence in their ability to deliver CC education and sustained involve CC education were noted among the intervention FD group, compared with the regular FD group. In the intervention group, senior academicians (associate and full professor) are more substantially involved in designing and leading CC-based courses than junior academicians (lecturers and assistant professors). Among non-teaching award winners of in the intervention FD group, the follow-up degree of sustained involvement in delivering, designing and leading CC-based courses was significantly higher than that of the regular group. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that leadership training in the intervention FD modules substantially motivated clinical instructors to become leaders in CC education.

Little research has examined the quality of panel discussions and how effectively they are facilitated. Methods Here, we present a mixed-method analysis of data from a survey of reviewers focused on their perceptions of the quality, effectiveness, and influence of panel discussion from their last peer review experience. Results Reviewers indicated that panel discussions were viewed favorably in terms of participation, clarifying differing opinions, informing unassigned reviewers, and chair facilitation. However, some reviewers mentioned issues with panel discussions, including an uneven focus, limited participation from unassigned reviewers, and short discussion times. Most reviewers felt the discussions affected the review outcome, helped in choosing the best science, and were generally fair and balanced. However, those who felt the discussion did not affect the outcome were also more likely to evaluate panel communication negatively, and several reviewers mentioned potential sources of bias related to the discussion. While respondents strongly acknowledged the importance of the chair in ensuring appropriate facilitation of the discussion to influence scoring and to limit the influence of potential sources of bias from the discussion on scoring, nearly a third of respondents did not find the chair of their most recent panel to have performed these roles effectively. Conclusions It is likely that improving chair training in the management of discussion as well as creating review procedures that are informed by the science of leadership and team communication would improve review processes and proposal review reliability.

This study focused on the area of the classroom environment and teacher-student interpersonal behavior to see the relationship between each variable with learning achievement, and the relationship between the two variables. By using a sample of 160 X-university students majoring in mathematics and then using the Chi-Square test method with a contingency table to determine the relationship between each variable and learning achievement. Then using the Pearson correlation method the relationship between classroom environment with the teacher-student interpersonal behavior was tested. Based on the analysis and calculation of the research conducted, it can be concluded that the classroom environment has a good relationship with learning achievement in the mathematics major and general subjects. Whereas the teacher-student interpersonal behavior shows a positive relationship with learning achievement in the dimensions of leadership, understanding, and friendly\\/helping but a negative relationship in the dimensions of strictness and disatisfaction.

Twenty-five years after the concept of emotional intelligence was introduced, it still captures the attention of scholars, practitioners, educators, and the public alike. Questions regarding how EI should be defined and measured, with different approaches both to theory and measurement, are still relevant. Emotional intelligence is usually analysed from two different perspectives \\u2013 the ability models or mixed models. While the ability models focus on an individual's mental abilities to apply information provided by emotions for the improvement of cognitive processing, mixed models conceptualize EI as the combination of mental abilities, stable behavioural traits and personality variables. This volume presents theoretical and empirical papers that address a variety of topics. Two review papers cover new and important themes: the mechanisms of emotional intelligence using a computational approach, and the question on how to transversely develop emotional intelligence through school subjects. Research papers investigate several topics: the relationships between measures of EI and transformational leadership; the effect of the implicit theories of EI and of ability and trait EI on students\\u2019 academic achievement; the relationship between perceived emotional intelligence, burnout, work engagement, and job satisfaction in Italian schoolteachers; the developmental changes in EI abilities during early adolescence; and the effects of short-term emotional intelligence training on preschool teachers. Four papers are dedicated to methodological themes: dealing with an ongoing problem of EI measurement, especially its cross-cultural effects: comparing differential item functioning procedure in traditional back translation of the questionnaire with the native translator version; measurement invariance of the Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Emotional Competence Questionnaire across five different countries (Slovenia, Russia, Croatia, India, and the Czech Republic); the psychometric properties of the Vocabulary of Emotions Test (VET) in Serbian context; construction and validation of the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire \\u2013 Children\\u2019s form (ESCQ-C). We hope that this special issue will broaden knowledge in this field and raise further questions about emotional intelligence construct. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the authors who contributed to this thematic issue, and to academic reviewers.

Paired teams of independent analysts conducted a search for relevant articles ( n = 8452 citations identified), filtered records for content abstraction and possible inclusion ( n = 163) and characterized selected studies ( n = 58). Most articles implemented activities that were aligned with community capacity dimensions of citizen participation (96.4%, n = 53), community power (78%, n = 45), leadership (78%, n = 45), and networks (81%, n = 47); few articles identified a direct policy change (22%, n = 13), and many articles discussed the policy implications of findings for future work (62%, n = 36). This review synthesizes three decades of efforts to reduce environmental inequities and identifies strategic approaches used for strengthening community capacity. community capacity; environmental justice; community organizing; mobilization; social justice; advocacy; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 3765, p 3765 (2020) Dana H.Z.

Besides, this research aims to analyze the influence of person-organization fit and job satisfaction on employee turnover intention, both simultaneously and partially. The type of this research is descriptive and verification research. The population in this research consists of employees from Bank SyariahBukopin, Bank BNI Syariah, and Bank JabarBantenSyariah. Sampling technique used in this research is non-probability sampling using a saturated sample technique. This research uses multiple regression employing more than one independent variable, namely person-organization fit (X1) and job satisfaction (X2). While the dependent variable is the turnover intention (Y). The results of this research show that turnover intention is significantly and simultaneously influenced by person-organization fit and job satisfaction variables of 37.50%. While the rest 62.50% is influenced by other variables outside this research. They are possibly organizational commitment, employee engagement, social support, change management, leadership, organizational behavior, and others. It is thus implied that there are many other potential variables which may affect employee turnover intention. Partially, the results of this research show that the person-organization fit does not affect turnover intention. However, job satisfaction affects turnover intention quite significantly. Thus, the better the job satisfaction is, the higher the turnover intention becomes. person-organization fit; job satisfaction; turnover intention; Engineering (General).

Further understanding of capacity development requires appropriate indicators and no previous indicators for faculty development of health profession educators were identified. The aim of the study was to identify indicators of capacity development in the context of faculty development programs at Tehran University of medical sciences (TUMS). Methods A nominal group technique session was conducted with key informants from faculty development program providers to generate and prioritize a list of capacity development indicators. Results A list of 26 indicators was generated and five categories were identified: Development and innovation in teaching and learning process, Development and innovation in communication and collaboration at different levels, Development and sustaining faculty development programs, Development of educational leadership and management, Development in scholarship. Conclusions Capacity development for faculty development interventions of health profession educators is a process of engagement within a wider system, including individual and collective action, and involves the socialization of the teachers into suitable roles through professional identity development and participation within the wider system. faculty development; capacity development; indicator; nominal group technique; Special aspects of education; LC8-6691 BMC Medical Education, Vol 20, Iss 1, Pp 1-8 (2020) Mahla Salajegheh; Roghayeh Gandomkar; Azim Mirzazadeh; John Sandars\"},{\"id\":\"71c265d11d05db4de0f7b5ed9e38946f953e3500f2077a9c969c316dae051fd3\",\"content\":\"Perceived leader integrity as a mediator between ethical leadership and ethical climate in a teaching context Abstract Background Scandalous incidents occurring in prominent organisations in the world have brought to limelight the role of leaders in shaping the ethical climate of their organisations. As a result, several studies across different organisational\\/occupational contexts and climes have examined and unanimously proven that ethical leadership was positively related to ethical climate. However, there is rarely any of these studies that was conducted in teaching context. Besides, the mechanisms involved between ethical leadership and ethical climate seems not to have been addressed in literature. Thus, this paper reports the findings of a study that investigated the mediating role of perceived leader integrity in the ethical leadership\\u2013ethical climate relationship among teachers. Methods Data were collected from 336 teachers (105 male and 231 female) in three-time periods using measures of ethical leadership, perceived leader integrity, ethical climate, and demographics. Results The results from OLS regression-based path analysis showed that: 1) ethical leadership was positively related to perceived leader integrity, 2) perceived leader integrity was positively related to ethical climate, 3) ethical leadership was positively related to ethical climate, and 4) the positive relationship between ethical leadership and ethical climate was mediated by perceived leader integrity. Conclusions The current study extends the social learning theory by identifying perceived leader integrity as a mechanism underlying the relationship between ethical leadership and ethical climate. The findings have some implications for personnel selection especially in relation to selection of ethical leaders.

Community pharmacies will be prioritised to address public health and clinical needs at a local level. To support the delivery of the new model, pharmacy technicians must be enabled and developed to optimize their roles. The aim of the study was to establish existing roles of pharmacy technicians working in the community pharmacy sector in Wales and to explore barriers and enablers to development. Methods: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies was used, with the main focus on quantitative methods. A total of 83 participants completed an online questionnaire and additional qualitative data were obtained from four semi\\u2010structured telephone interviews. Results: The dispensing and final accuracy checking of medicines were reported as core functions of the community pharmacy technician role, with an average of 43% and 57% of time being spent on these roles, respectively. There was some evidence of engagement in leadership and management roles (average of 19%) and limited evidence of delivery of services (average of 6%). Conclusions: There is scope to enable community pharmacy technicians to optimize and further develop their roles. Enablers include the effective use of delegation, workplace support, improved staffing levels and the prioritisation of extended pharmacy technician roles. pharmacy technician; community pharmacy; roles; responsibilities; barriers; enablers; Pharmacy and materia medica; RS1-441 Pharmacy, Vol 8, Iss 97, p 97 (2020) Rebecca Chamberlain; Jan Huyton; Delyth James\"},{\"id\":\"a17dd85651a0b4adc137ade74467a71e0f39f9b65af428b48215d98c308bb400\",\"content\":\"Experience of transformative leadership: subordinate\\u2019s perspective Despite the growing popularity of transformational leadership (TL) in organization studies, there is a lack of studies trying to reveal subordinate\\u2019s perspective on experience of TL.

This essay considers four main challenges into which veterinarians are increasingly being drawn, as they respond to increasing public expectation for them to be scientific and moral authorities in animal welfare in addition to their traditional role as trusted health experts. They include: (1) to go beyond traditional conceptions of health by adopting a holistic view that also considers animal welfare, not only disease treatment; (2) to reimagine their professional duties when it comes to disease prevention at the intersection of animal-human-ecosystem health; (3) to develop core competencies\\/proficiency in animal welfare science and ethics in order to navigate discourses concerning competing priorities and socio-political ideologies and to provide professional leadership in animal welfare; (4) to provide feedback on novel networked devices, monitoring technologies and automated animal welfare solutions and their impact on animals\\u2019 welfare. To competently navigate the intricacies of the socio-political and connected world as trusted authorities and conduits for innovation in and through animal welfare, veterinarians and veterinary students are encouraged to: (a) develop core competencies in veterinary ethics, animal welfare science and deliberative capacities that are well-informed by current multidisciplinary frameworks, such as One Health; (b) engage interested parties in more effective collaboration and ethical decision-making in order to address animal welfare related concerns within their immediate sphere of influence (e.g., in a given community); and (c) participate in the process of engineering and technological design that incorporates animals\\u2019 welfare data (such as their preferences) for real-time animal monitoring through adding animal scientific and values-aware evidence in information technology systems. In order to tackle these challenges, four pillars are suggested to help guide veterinarians and the veterinary profession.

Little research focuses on practical capacity building strategies and monitoring. Our paper looks into involving stakeholders in facilitated group discussions as a specific strategy for fostering capacity building processes. These processes focused on physical activity (PA) promotion in two German communities (ACTION4men). Along the dimensions of capacity building suggested in literature (e.g., problem solving, resource mobilization, leadership), we implemented two participatory stakeholder groups (1\\/community). These groups were motivated to develop and implement PA interventions for men >50 years. For measuring capacity building processes, a semi-standardized monitoring instrument was used to document all group meetings. Additionally, we conducted semi-standardized interviews with group participants and drop-outs to capture their perspectives on capacity building. All documents were analyzed using thematic analysis. We successfully established stakeholder groups that planned and implemented a range of local measures meant to increase PA among older men. In one community, the process was sustainable, whereby the group continued to meet regularly over years. Capacity building was successful to a certain degree (e.g., regarding participation, problem assessment, and resource mobilization), but stalled after first meetings. Capacity building processes differed between the two communities in terms of leadership and sustainability. The developed interventions mainly addressed the access to organized sport courses, rather than tackling walkability or active transport. The theoretical capacity building approach was successful to develop and implement programs aimed at promoting PA. The actual capacity building processes depend upon the composition of stakeholder groups and inherent power relations. physical activity; men; community capacity; capacity building; setting approach; health promotion; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 2306, p 2306 (2020) Julika Loss; Nicola Brew-Sam; Boris Metz; Helmut Strobl; Alexandra Sauter; Susanne Tittlbach\"},{\"id\":\"cb8564a3f89416979d1b12afc28cd8ff134dc6e0fe3f16b9705eed3d3980bf3d\",\"content\":\"Leadership Styles of Rural Leaders in the Context of Sustainable Development Requirements: A Case Study of Commune Mayors in the Greater Poland Province, Poland In the context of sustainable and durable development postulates, local leadership and rural governance is a matter of particular importance. As a local leader, the commune mayor should have a vision of the commune\\u2019s development and possess the ability to influence the citizens and involve them in the process of realizing that vision. Such a manner of governance is the essence of transformational leadership, which, according to the multifactor model developed by Bass and Avoilo, facilitates the achievement of positive organizational and social results. The authors\\u2019 research is an attempt to answer the question about the style of governance adopted by the political leaders of rural communes in Poland and its links with their engagement in social activation and the use of participatory tools. A survey was conducted on a sample of 49 commune mayors from the Greater Poland Province (43%) using the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and a questionnaire about public participation developed by the authors. The results indicate that components of transactional leadership predominate among commune mayors from the Greater Poland Province. Transformational leadership, which is largely based on the leader\\u2019s charisma, is exhibited much less frequently.

A Game Theoretical Analysis of a Closed-Loop Supply Chain under Different Power Structures As awareness of environmental protection increases worldwide, enterprises have been building their supply chains in ways that conserve natural resources and minimize the creation of pollutants. One of the practical ways to make supply chains more sustainable is for enterprises to utilize green innovation strategies and to increase resource reuse. In this work, we focus on a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer, and a collector. In the investigated CLSC, the manufacturer and the retailer drive the green innovation strategy either individually or simultaneously to boost market demand. In the reverse flow of the CLSC, the collector is responsible for collecting consumers\\u2019 used products and transferring them to the manufacturer for remanufacturing. By combining two types of the market leadership and three types of green innovation strategies, we establish six different Stackelberg game models and solve them analytically. Through an extensive comparative analysis, we show who should have market leadership and who should drive the green innovation strategy in the CLSC. Various numerical examples are also given to support our major findings. One of our key findings suggests that the supply chain members must participate in green innovation activities at the same time to achieve a win-win scenario in the CLSC. recycling; green innovation effort; power structure; closed-loop supply chain; game theory; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 2274, p 2274 (2020) Dooho Lee\"},{\"id\":\"4e18bec39babffba70a6a3a6966047dc0a844dde2ace7ef241e7654ff59e630e\",\"content\":\"What will it take? Using an implementation research framework to identify facilitators and barriers in implementing a school-based referral system for sexual health services Abstract Background Across the United States, sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy rates are alarmingly high among youth. Schools, due to their proximity and access to youth, can increase student access to sexual health services (SHS) by creating referral systems (RS) to link students to school- and community-based SHS. From 2013 to 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s Division of Adolescent and School Health funded 17 Local Education Agencies (LEA) to partner with priority schools and stakeholders to develop and implement RS to increase student access to SHS. Cicatelli Associates Inc. (CAI) was funded to provide capacity-building to LEA. In 2016\\u20132017, CAI conducted case studies at two LEA, both large and urban sites, but representing different geographical and political contexts, to elucidate factors that influence RS implementation. Methods Nineteen LEA and community-based healthcare (CBH) staff were interviewed in the Southeastern (n = 9) and Western U.S. (n = 10). Key constructs (e.g., leadership engagement, resources, state and district policies) across the five domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework guided the methodology and analysis. Qualitative data was analyzed using the Framework Method and contextual factors and themes that led to RS implementation were identified. Results Interviewees strongly believed that school-based RS can decrease STI, HIV and unintended pregnancy and increase students\\u2019 educational attainment. We identified the following contextual key factors that facilitate successful implementation and integration of an RS: enforcing state and district policies, strong LEA and CBH collaboration, positive school culture towards adolescent health, knowledgeable and supportive staff, leveraging of existing resources and staffing structures, and influential district and school building-level leadership and champions. Notably, this case study challenged our initial assumptions that RS are easily implemented in states with comprehensive SHS policies. Rather, our conversations revealed how districts and local-level policies can have significant impact and influence to impede or promote those policies. Conclusions Through the use of the CFIR framework, the interviews identified important contextual factors and themes associated with LEAs\\u2019 implementation barriers and facilitators. The study\\u2019s results present key recommendations that other LEA can consider to optimize integration of RS-related evidence-based practices, systems, and policies in their districts.

To learn how this promising new healthcare model works in an Australian setting we explored experiences of healthcare providers in outer urban Sydney, where a number of practices are transitioning from traditional Australian general practice models to incorporate elements of PCMH approaches. Methods We collected qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers working in a range of transitioning practices and thematically analysed the data. We interviewed 35 participants including general practitioners, practice managers and practice nurses from 25 purposively sampled general practices in western Sydney, Australia, seeking maximal variation in practice size, patient demographics and type of engagement in practice transformation. Results Interviewees described PCMH transformation highlighting the importance of whole of practice engagement with a shared vision; key strategies for transformation to PCMH models of care including leadership, training and supportive information technology; structures and processes required to provide team-based, data-driven care; and constraints such as lack of space and the current Australian fee-for-service general practice funding model. They also reported their perceptions of early outcomes of the PCMH model of care, describing enhanced patient and staff satisfaction and also noting fewer hospital admissions, as likely to reduce costs of care. Conclusions Our study exploring the experience of early adopters of PCMH models of care in Australia, informs the international movement towards PCMH models of care. Our findings provide guidance for practices considering similar transitions and describe the challenges of such transitions within a fee-for-service payment system.

One of the reasons for HIT implementation failure is poor leadership in healthcare organisations, and thus, more research is needed on leaders\\u2019 roles in HIT implementation. The aim of the review was to identify the role of healthcare leaders in HIT implementation. A scoping review with content analysis was conducted using a five-step framework defined by Arksey and O\\u2019Malley. Database searches were performed using CINAHL, Business Source Complete, ProQuest, Scopus and Web of Science. The included studies were written either in English or Finnish, published between 2000 and 2019, focused on HIT implementation and contained leadership insight given by various informants. In total, 16 studies were included. The roles of healthcare leaders were identified as supporter, change manager, advocate, project manager, manager, facilitator and champion. Identifying healthcare leaders\\u2019 roles in HIT implementation may allow us to take a step closer to successful HIT implementation. Yet, it seems that healthcare leaders cannot fully realise these identified roles and their understanding of HIT needs enforcement. Also, healthcare leaders seem to need more support when actively participating in HIT implementation. health information technology (HIT); implementation; healthcare; leader; scoping review; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 2865, p 2865 (2020) Elina Laukka; Moona Huhtakangas; Tarja Heponiemi; Outi Kanste\"},{\"id\":\"a2577c82dd78c715d464c2f27f5025f789e24b01e77ec294a437546a61ea9557\",\"content\":\"Bridge2Hyku: Meeting Practitioners\\u2019 Needs in Digital Collection Migration to Open Source Samvera Repository The University of Houston Libraries, in partnership and consultation with numerous institutions, was awarded an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership\\/Project Grant to create the Bridge2Hyku (B2H) Toolkit.

The reasons are multi-factorial and include patient, practice, healthcare system and societal factors, such as multi-morbidity, the diversity of populations and innovations in medical care. Also, practice-related factors, like stressful patient-staff interactions, poor process management of waiting times and lack of leadership, play a role. This publicly funded study evaluates the effectiveness of the newly developed participatory, interdisciplinary, and multimodal IMPROVEjob intervention on improving job satisfaction among general practice personnel. The intervention aims at structural stress prevention with regard to working conditions and behavioural stress prevention for leaders and other practice personnel. Methods In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, a total of 56 general practices will be assigned to either (1) participation in the IMPROVEjob intervention or (2) the waiting-list control group. The IMPROVEjob intervention consists of the following elements: three workshops, a toolbox with supplemental material and an implementation period with regular contact to so-called IMPROVEjob facilitators. The first workshop, addressing leadership issues, is designed for physicians with leadership responsibilities only. The two subsequent workshops target all GP and non-physician personnel; they address issues of communication (with patients and within the team), self-care and team-care and practice organisation. During the 9-month implementation period, practices will be contacted by IMPROVEjob facilitators to enhance motivation. Additionally, the practices will have access to the toolbox materials online. All participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and follow up. The primary outcome is the change in job satisfaction as measured by the respective scale of the validated German version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ, version 2018). Secondary outcomes obtained by questionnaires and - qualitatively - by facilitators comprise psychosocial working conditions including leadership aspects, expectations and experiences of the workshops, team and individual efforts and organisational changes. Discussion It is hypothesised that participation in the IMPROVEjob intervention will improve job satisfaction and thus constitute a structural and behavioural prevention strategy for the promotion of psychological wellbeing of personnel in general practices and prospectively in other small and medium sized enterprises.

However, in common with other medical professions, there is no one broadly accepted definition of competence. Studies in nursing have revealed that practicing nurses may view newly qualified colleagues as lacking competence, leading to disillusionment with nursing training programmes. Similar studies are lacking in veterinary nursing, despite the profession having recently undergone a similar transition from workplace-based training to undergraduate education. Methods A mixed methods explanatory study surveyed 66 Irish registered veterinary nurses and 31 first year veterinary nursing students at two Irish third level institutions to obtain their views on what constitutes veterinary nursing competence and when veterinary nurses develop it. The surveys were followed by student focus groups and semi-structured one-on-one interviews with registered veterinary nurses. Content analysis was employed to analyse the surveys, while the focus groups and interview transcripts underwent thematic analysis. Results Students perceived competence primarily as the ability to provide patient care, and they expected it to develop close to the time of graduation. RVNs held a broader definition of competence, incorporating leadership skills and confidence as well as patient care provision. RVNs expected it to take approximately two years of workplace-based experience post-graduation for a veterinary nurse to develop competence. In addition, RVNs recognised that anxiety felt by many newly qualified veterinary nurses during this period could be attenuated by mentorship from more experienced colleagues. Conclusions Irish RVNs and veterinary nursing students perceive competence differently, similar to previous findings from the nursing profession. Educators and regulators should provide explicit descriptions of terms such as \\u2018competence\\u2019 to avoid confusion and possible disillusionment amongst veterinary nursing stakeholders.

It is worth noting that the incidence of the disease is extremely high in the low- and middle-income nations, which are having multiple other competing public health priorities, a weak health-care delivery system, or ongoing humanitarian emergencies. South Sudan has been subjected to long-term conflicts, and with regard to measles, it has been reported that more than 4700 cases and 26 deaths have been reported in the nation since the disease outbreak began last year. Keeping this in mind and in order to avert fatal consequences and accomplish 95% vaccine coverage, the international welfare agencies have joined their hands together and initiated a vaccination drive to immunize 2.5 million children across the entire nation along with the provision of Vitamin A and deworming tablets. In conclusion, considering the fact that measles is vaccine preventable and every child deserves the right to receive the vaccine, it is high time that we take necessary steps to ensure political leadership, strengthening of health facilities, and involvement of the parents so that the planned vaccination campaign can accomplish the intended results in the conflict-affected South Sudan. measles; south sudan; world health organization; Medicine; R Medical Journal of Babylon, Vol 17, Iss 2, Pp 229-230 (2020) Saurabh RamBihariLal Shrivastava; Prateek Saurabh Shrivastava\"},{\"id\":\"e21ae67eb0f7e65e3be736743d4c78237fef192513d5cf184fb82ecef1a1d4c0\",\"content\":\"Overload of nursing work through Nursing Activities Score as an evaluating tool The present study sought to identify the use of Nursing Activities Score (NAS) to evaluate the nursing work overload in national nursing studies. It is an integrative review of the literature, composed of: topic choice, bibliographic survey, formulation of guiding question, search of articles, reading and final writing of the work. The search for articles was carried out by consulting the VHL (Virtual Health Library) databases between 2009 and 2019, using data sources such as LILACS, BDENF, Medline and Scielo. Sixteen articles were selected, which raised several factors to be considered when dealing with workload for nursing, such as knowledge, technique, skills, leadership profile, staff dimensioning, care sites, and others that directly implicate the quality of care. Many studies confirm the NAS as a managerial tool, but still see the low utilization of it. It is necessary to promote the use of the instrument in addition to the ICU services in the country, with a view to improving the work, especially of nursing professionals, and providing a better management of care for patients. carga de trabalho; unidades de terapia intensiva; cuidados de enfermagem; recursos humanos de enfermagem; equipe de enfermagem; Special aspects of education; LC8-6691; Science (General); Q1-390; Social Sciences; H Research, Society and Development, Vol 9, Iss 5, Pp e47951141-e47951141 (2020) Victor Hugo da Silva Martins; Fernanda Ribeiro Nascimento; Nadyr Cristina Bezerra; Tatiana Carla Carvalho Amorim Guisande; Ven\\u00e2ncio de Sant'ana Tavares; Angely Anny de Castro Alencar; Anna Paula Lima de Souza; Lucas Rafael Monteiro Belfort; Mar\\u00edlia Andrada Brito Carvalho\"},{\"id\":\"c5d7f95168d9a602fd2d4d6d4eacd2269bcacf2bb9d49eac53c03b638bb62d6a\",\"content\":\"Antenatal testing for anaemia, HIV and syphilis in Indonesia \\u2013 a health systems analysis of low coverage Abstract Background Adverse pregnancy outcomes can be prevented through the early detection and treatment of anaemia, HIV and syphilis during the antenatal period. Rates of testing for anaemia, HIV and syphilis among women attending antenatal services in Indonesia are low, despite its mandate in national guidelines and international policy. Methods Midwife-held antenatal care records for 2015 from 8 villages in 2 sub-districts within Cianjur district were reviewed, alongside the available sub-district Puskesmas (Community Health Centre) maternity and laboratory records. We conducted four focus group discussions with kaders (community health workers) (n = 16) and midwives (n = 9), and 13 semi-structured interviews with laboratory and counselling, public sector maternity and HIV management and relevant non-governmental organisation staff. Participants were recruited from village, sub-district, district and national level as relevant to role. Results We were unable to find a single recorded result of antenatal testing for HIV, syphilis or anaemia in the village (566 women) or Puskesmas records (2816 women) for 2015. Laboratory records did not specifically identify antenatal women. Participants described conducting and reporting testing in a largely ad hoc manner; relying on referral to health facilities based on clinical suspicion or separate non-maternity voluntary counselling and testing programs. Participants recognized significant systematic challenges with key differences between the more acceptable (and reportedly more often implemented) haemoglobin testing and the less acceptable (and barely implemented) HIV and syphilis testing. However, a clear need for leadership and accountability emerged as an important factor for prioritizing antenatal testing and addressing these testing gaps. Conclusions Practical solutions such as revised registers, availability of point-of-care tests and capacity building of field staff will therefore need to be accompanied by both funding and political will to coordinate, prioritize and be accountable for testing in pregnancy.

The Islamization in Indramayu raises three main questions. The first question is, where was the arrival of Islam in Indramayu. Second, when is the appearance of Islam. Third, who has a role in the Islamization process. This research uses the historical method, which consists of four stages: heuristic, criticism, interpretation, and historiography. This method was then collaborated with Islamic social movement theory to analyze the ideology of leadership and movement mobility of the propagator group of Islam in Indramayu. The results showed that the arrival of Islam in Indramayu came from the port of Cimanuk. Then spread to various areas, including in the countryside. Second, Islam has been dating in Indramayu since the 15th century. Third, some communities play a role in Islamization in Indramayu. The communities were very influential until the 19th century. They consisted of the Arab community and the adherents of the tarekat, especially from Cirebon. The first order to develop was Syattariyah. Meanwhile, the Arabic community leader from Cirebon was Sayyid Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad Basy-Syaiban. He is a figure who originated from the Hadramaut in the early seventeenth century.

Insights for Capacity Strengthening in Ghana Introduction: District health managers (DHMs) play a pivotal role in the operation of district health systems in low\\u2014and middle income countries, including Ghana. Their capacity is determined by their competencies, but also by the organization and system in which they are embedded. The objective of this paper is to explore how district health management emerges from contextual, organizational, and individual factors in order to demonstrate that capacity strengthening efforts at district level need to transcend individual competencies to take on more systemic approaches.Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 21) were conducted to gain insight into aspects that affect district health management in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Interviews were conducted with DHMs (n = 15) from six different districts, as well as with their superiors at the regional level (n = 4) and peers from non-governmental organizations (n = 2). A thematic analysis was conducted by using an analytical approach based on systems theory.Results: Contextual aspects, such as priorities among elected officials, poor infrastructure and working conditions, centralized decision-making, delayed disbursement of funds and staff shortages, affect organizational processes and the way DHMs carry out their role. Enabling organizational aspects that provide DHMs with direction and a clear perception of their role, include positive team dynamics, good relations with supervisors, job descriptions, appraisals, information systems, policies and guidelines. Meanwhile, hierarchical organizational structures, agendas driven by vertical programs and limited opportunities for professional development provide DHMs with limited authority to make decisions and dampens their motivation. The DHMs ability to carry out their role effectively depends on their perception of their role and the effort they expend, in addition to their competencies. In regards to competencies, a need for more general management and leadership skills were called for by DHMs as well as by their superiors and peers.Conclusion: Systemic approaches are called for in order to strengthen district health management capacity. This study can provide national policy-makers, donors and researchers with a deeper understanding of factors that should be taken into consideration when developing, planning, implementing, and assessing capacity-building strategies targeted at strengthening district health management. management and leadership; capacity strengthening; district health systems; systems thinking; complex adaptive systems; low- and middle-income countries; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270 Frontiers in Public Health, Vol 8 (2020) Anne Christine Stender Heerdegen; Jana Gerold; Samuel Amon; Samuel Agyei Agyemang; Moses Aikins; Kaspar Wyss\"},{\"id\":\"d381260e18e828843eafef49876fa6f9ac9c0b8cf00896b5fdeabbf1439fefc5\",\"content\":\"Managing Resident Workforce and Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic Background:. The novel coronavirus and associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading throughout the world, with robust growth in the United States. Its drastic impact on the global population and international health care is swift, evolving, and unpredictable. The effects on orthopaedic surgery departments are predominantly indirect, with widespread cessation of all nonessential orthopaedic care. Although this is vital to the system-sustaining measures of isolation and resource reallocation, there is profound detriment to orthopaedic training programs. Methods:. In the face of new pressures on the finite timeline on an orthopaedic residency, the Emory University School of Medicine Department of Orthopaedics has devised a 5-pronged strategy based on the following: (1) patient and provider safety, (2) uninterrupted necessary care, (3) system sustainability, (4) adaptability, and (5) preservation of vital leadership structures. Results:. Our 5 tenants support a 2-team system, whereby the residents are divided into cycling \\u201cactive-duty\\u201d and \\u201cworking remotely\\u201d factions. In observation of the potential incubation period of viral symptoms, phase transitions occur every 2 weeks with strict adherence to team assignments. Intrateam redundancy can accommodate potential illness to ensure a stable unit of able residents. Active duty residents participate in in-person surgical encounters and virtual ambulatory encounters, whereas remotely working residents participate in daily video-conferenced faculty-lead, case-based didactics and pursue academic investigation, grant writing, and quality improvement projects. To sustain this, faculty and administrative 2-team systems are also in place to protect the leadership and decision-making components of the department. Conclusions:. The novel coronavirus has decimated the United States healthcare system, with an unpredictable duration, magnitude, and variability. As collateral damage, orthopaedic residencies are faced with new challenges to provide care and educate residents in the face of safety, resource redistribution, and erosion of classic learning opportunities. Our adaptive approach aims to be a generalizable tactic to optimize our current landscape. Orthopedic surgery; RD701-811 JBJS Open Access, Vol 5, Iss 2, Pp e0045-e0045 (2020) Andrew M.

The University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCD CCC) was funded to integrate tobacco treatment into cancer care. Lessons learned from the UCD CCC are illustrated across a systems framework with the Cancer Care Continuum and by applying constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Findings demonstrate different motivational drivers for the cancer center and the broader health system. Implementation readiness across the domains of the Cancer Care Continuum with clinical entities was more mature in the Prevention domain, but Screening, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survivorship domains demonstrated less implementation readiness despite leadership engagement. Over a two-year implementation process, the UCD CCC focused on enhancing information and knowledge sharing within the treatment domain with the support of the cancer committee infrastructure, while identifying available resources and adapting workflows for various cancer care service lines. The UCD CCC findings, while it may not be generalizable to all cancer centers, demonstrate the application of conceptual frameworks to accelerate implementation for a sustainable tobacco treatment program.

The Chinese economic system is such that local government competition has become a key factor affecting regional green development under the current leadership. Based on the inter-provincial panel data of 30 provinces in mainland China from 1997 to 2017, this paper uses the total-factor non-radial directional distance function and slack-based measure data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) to measure the green development efficiency of the provinces. Additionally, it also uses the Malmquist\\u2013Luenberger (ML) index to decompose green development efficiency and analyzes its internal driving factors. Finally, taking environmental regulation as a mediating variable, this paper empirically analyzes the influence mechanism of local government competition on green development efficiency from three perspectives including growth competition, fiscal competition and investment competition. The study found that: the green development efficiency of Chinese regions showed a downward trend, with significant regional differences; technological progress is the key factor to improve the efficiency of green development, and its role gradually decreases from eastern to western and central regions; pure technical efficiency has become a bottleneck restricting the improvement of green development efficiency, while scale efficiency shows significant regional differences; the growth competition, fiscal competition and investment competition of local government all have a significant inhibitory effect on the efficiency of green development.

Leader emergence is a crucial topic in collective leadership, yet it is challenging to investigate as the problem context is typically highly complex and dynamic. Here, we explore leadership emergence and leadership perception by means of computational simulations whose assumptions and parameters were informed by empirical research and human-subject experiments. Our agent-based model describes the process of group planning. Each agent is assigned with three key attributes: talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility. An agent can propose a suggestion to modify the group plan as a speaker or respond and evaluate others\\u2019 suggestions and leadership as a listener. Simulation results suggested that agents with high values of talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility tended to be perceived as leaders by their peers. Results also showed that talkativeness may be the most significant and instantaneous predictor for leader emergence of the three investigated attributes: talkativeness, intelligence, and credibility. In terms of group performance, smaller groups may outperform larger groups regarding their problem-solving ability in the beginning, but their performance tends to be of no significant difference in a long run. These results match the empirical literature and offer a mechanistic, operationalized description of the collective leadership processes. Electronic computers.

Strategic leadership is widely assumed to be a responsibility that defaults to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). However, in practice, what most CEOs do is strategic management rather than strategic leadership. While strategic management does share key aspects of strategic leadership CEOs are expected to prioritize the managerial side over the leadership side. This is just one of the situations in which the board-room assumes the leadership role. This paper discusses how boards of directors conduct the process of strategic leadership in their organizations. In recent years there has been an increasing interest among scholars to understand how boards strategize from a behavioral point of view. This growing interest has resulted in the development of various typologies regarding boards\\u2019 involvement in the strategic leadership processes. board of directors; corporate governance; strategic leadership; agency theory; principal agent problem; stewardship theory; board typologies; g30; g34; m14; Economics as a science; HB71-74 Economics and Business Review, Vol 6, Iss 1, Pp 103-119 (2020) Castellanos Julio David; George Babu\"},{\"id\":\"2bcecb49c6ed8640a6a49101e7da6bc5db02945c60c96c0afa86e1bf39771186\",\"content\":\"Academic benchmarks for leaders in Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery: a Canadian perspective Abstract Background The present study summarizes the demographics, subspecialty training, and academic productivity of contemporary leaders in Canadian Otolaryngology \\u2013 Head & Neck Surgery (OHNS) training programs across Canada. Methods Demographic data regarding chairpersons (CPs) and program directors (PDs) were obtained from publicly-available faculty listings and online sources, and included employment institution, residency training, fellowship training status, gender, and years of post-graduate experience. Research productivity was measured using the h-index and number of publications, obtained from Scopus. Characteristics of CPs and PDs were compared using statistical analysis. Results Cross-sectional data was obtained from a total of 27 CPs and PDs from 13 accredited OHNS training programs across Canada active on July 1, 2019. All academic leaders completed at least 1 year of fellowship training. Head and neck oncology represented 77% of CPs and 59% of academic leaders overall, while pediatric otolaryngology represented 43% of PDs. Females represented 11% of academic leaders. There was a significant association between location of residency training and employment, with 56% (15\\/27) of physicians working where they had trained (p = 0.001, Fisher\\u2019s exact test; \\u03c6 = 2.63, p = 0.001). On average, individuals with a graduate (Master\\u2019s) degree had a significantly higher H-index (17.7 vs 7.4, p = 0.001) and greater number of publications (106 vs. 52, p = 0.02). Compared to PDs, CPs had a significantly higher average h-index score (14.5 vs. 8.14, p = 0.04) and accrued more years of post-graduate experience (29.7 vs. 21.3 years, p = 0.008). There were no differences in the proportions of CPs and PDs with graduate degrees. There appeared to be a decline in research productivity beginning 3 years after academic appointment. Conclusions This cross-sectional overview of academic leaders in Canadian OHNS programs demonstrates the following key findings: 1) all leaders completed fellowship training; 2) head and neck surgical oncology was the most common fellowship training subspecialty; 3) leaders were likely to be employed at the institution where they trained; 4) a Master\\u2019s degree may be associated with increased research productivity; 5) there is a potential risk of decreased productivity after appointment to a leadership position; and 6) women are underrepresented in academic leadership roles.

These core competencies are the critical competencies to be developed in specific areas. There are different core competencies for nurse managers, but none in the Spanish health system. The objective of this research is to identify the core competencies needed for nurse managers in the Spanish health system. The research was carried out using the Delphi method to reach a consensus on the core competencies and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine construct validity, reducing the dimensionality of a dataset by finding the causes of variability in the set and organizing them by importance. A panel of 50 experts in management and healthcare engaged in a four-round Delphi study with Likert scored surveys. We identified eight core competencies from an initial list of 51: decision making, relationship management, communication skills, listening, Leadership, conflict management, ethical principles, collaboration and team management skills. PCA indicated the structural validity of the core competencies by saturation into three components (\\u03b1 Cronbach >0.613): communication, leadership and decision making. The research shows that eight competencies must be developed by the nursing managers in the Spanish health system. Nurse managers can use these core competencies as criteria to develop and plan their professional career. These core competencies can serve as a guideline for the design of nurse managers\\u2019 development programs in Spain. nurse manager; competence; core competencies; governance; leadership; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 3173, p 3173 (2020) Alberto Gonz\\u00e1lez Garc\\u00eda; Arrate Pinto-Carral; Jes\\u00fas Sanz Villorejo; Pilar Marqu\\u00e9s-S\\u00e1nchez\"},{\"id\":\"a54978b4c547fb3578736dca7db8ffceefbfc4bae2ed39dce2ed82289b1c853c\",\"content\":\"Paternalist Liderlik Beklentisi: Y Ku\\u015fa\\u011f\\u0131 \\u0130\\u015fletme \\u00d6\\u011frencileri \\u00dczerine Bir Ara\\u015ft\\u0131rma Bu \\u00e7al\\u0131\\u015fman\\u0131n temel amac\\u0131, Y Ku\\u015fa\\u011f\\u0131 bireylerin y\\u00f6neticilerinden Paternalist Liderlik davran\\u0131\\u015flar\\u0131 bekleyip beklemediklerinin tespit edilmesidir.

One of the main deforestation control policies implemented by the Brazilian government over the last 15 years has been the creation of an extensive system of protected areas, including extractive reserves. Our study addresses the challenges of reducing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. We analyze the role of institutions in controlling deforestation, focusing on the formal rules contained within the Management Agreements of extractive reserves. We chose two extreme cases: the Rio Ouro Preto Extractive Reserve and the Rio Caut\\u00e1rio Extractive Reserve, in the state of Rond\\u00f4nia, Brazil. Within each case, we analyzed the association between the recognition of the formal rules and the extent of deforestation. We collected data through eight focus groups, with a total of 61 reserve residents, which used a didactic story to understand reserve residents\\u2019 familiarity with the Management Agreement rules. In both cases, there was high recognition of the formal rules governing natural resource use in the reserves, although there was heterogeneity among communities and in the mechanisms that facilitate recognition. The factors contributing to the recognition and non-recognition of the formal rules by reserve residents included: learning strategies (theoretical and practical); speed of institutional change; rules content (ambiguous and not well-adapted); endogenous factors (e.g. leadership, relationships); and exogenous factors (e.g. economic change, conflict and pressures). amazonia; brazil; deforestation; governance; livelihoods; natural resource management; Political institutions and public administration (General); JF20-2112 International Journal of the Commons, Vol 14, Iss 1 (2020) Mauro Guilherme Maidana Capelari; Ricardo Corr\\u00eaa Gomes; Suely Mara Vaz Guimar\\u00e3es de Ara\\u00fajo; Peter Newton\"},{\"id\":\"464fc417618870ea38587c438b93a015e062ac76cc26f07ec84fc74284654cbd\",\"content\":\"LEADERSHIP AND CRISIS BASED ON CONTINGENCY APPROACH AND LEADER\\u2019S FATAL FLAWS A CASE STUDY IN X INSTITUTE INDONESIA The power of a leader is on the impact on the people that he leads, the organization\\u2019s condition and the sustainability of the organization.Conditions in the organization is a difficult thing to predict.

This research focuses on the CEO\\u2013TMT interface to explain how CEOs influence TMT characteristics, which in turn affects TMT outcomes. Based on social learning theory, this study examines the associations among CEO ethical leadership, TMT cohesion, and TMT creativity in a Chinese context using a total of 91 TMTs. To verify the reliability and validity of the constructs, a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were run. The results showed that the hypothetical model captured distinct constructs and fits the data well. A multistep regression method was used to test hypotheses. The results indicated that: (a) CEO ethical leadership has a positive effect on TMT creativity; (b) TMT cohesion plays a mediating role in the relationship between CEO ethical leadership and TMT creativity; and (c) power distance plays a moderating role in the relationship between CEO ethical leadership and TMT creativity. The greater the power distance, the weaker the positive relationship between CEO ethical leadership and TMT creativity. This study demonstrates the value of CEO ethical leadership and advocates the importance of establishing team cohesion and building a psychologically safe environment to motivate top managers within an organization to share information and knowledge to improve creativity.

The relevance of the presented study is determined, on the one hand, by the increased infl uence of social media on political life, and, on the other hand, by the need to understand political confl icts not only as confl icts of interest, but also as confl icts of social meanings and ideas. The article discusses and interprets the meanings of two social communities \\u0303 supporters of the independence of Catalonia and supporters of the unity of Spain, implied in the communication carried out using the social network Twitter. The analysis is based on an empirical study of twitter messages by the method of quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The main socio-political attitudes of the parties to the confl ict, expressed in remarks on tweets of representatives of the EU leadership, are examined. The time interval of the study covers two years \\u0303 from May 2017 to June 2019. Based on an analysis of the level of communication activity of network users, it was revealed that the supporters of the independence of Catalonia act as a more active and cohesive social community, compared with the supporters of the unity of Spain. They have clear ideas about the political situation in the country and the region, as well as expressed ideological principles. This allows us to conclude that there is a narrative of independent Catalonia formed in public opinion. However, the meanings concerning the problems of social relations in the country and the region, arising in the light of the requirements of independence, remain in the shadow of communication. The passive nature of the participation of supporters of the unity of Spain in network communication in this area, as well as the content of their remarks, indicates the absence of a formed social base of supporters of unity, both among the inhabitants of Catalonia and among the rest of the Spanish citizens. This may be due to ideological lag, in which supporters of the country's unity are guided by outdated ideological stereotypes that are not able to unite them into a real social community with a certain political worldview. According to the findings of the study, it is precisely the ideas of the parties to the confl ict about social relations in the country that are their weak link that does not allow reaching a new level of political compromise or consensus. catalan crisis; social meanings; the independence movement of catalonia; supporters of the unity of spain; the european union; twitter communication; ideology; Political science (General); JA1-92 Sravnitel\\u02b9na\\u00e2 Politika, Vol 11, Iss 1, Pp 151-169 (2020) N.
