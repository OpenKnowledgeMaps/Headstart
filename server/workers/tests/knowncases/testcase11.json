Starting from ancient times, people today, and people in the future always want the same thing as happiness. The concept of happiness is not something new for both the world of Sufism and philosophy, therefore the concept of happiness experiences the dynamic development of the concept. Hamka is one of the scholars in Indonesia who discusses the concept of happiness, but Hamka has its own characteristics in explaining happiness. According to Hamka, happiness actually exists in every human being, happiness can be achieved from inside, not from outside, happiness that comes from outside of ourself is only as a complement to happiness inside, happiness can be achieved if humans always hone and develop tools which can be used to achieve happiness and these tools are religion, reason, and mind. These three things have a relationship with each other, if humans are able to develop these three things then humans can achieve happiness in their lives. In achieving happiness, these three things can be applied by using several methods namely zuhud, sincere, qana\\u2019ah and tawakal. The background of this research will explain the concept of happiness in the modern mysticism of Hamka. This research is a library research, and to make it more functional and useful, this paper will be equipped by a description method, interpretation and analysis of data in detail for each problem raised, therefore it can obtain a comprehensive understanding.\",\"published_in\":\"Refleksi: Jurnal Filsafat dan Pemikiran Islam; Vol 19, No 2 (2019); 205-220 ; 2548-4745 ; 1411-9951\",\"year\":\"2020-06-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"happiness; zuhud; Sufism; philosophy\",\"subject\":\"happiness; zuhud; Sufism; philosophy\",\"authors\":\"Arrasyid, Arrasyid\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/ushuluddin\\/ref\\/article\\/view\\/2261\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5c566bb38d4694f93c05b3b2eec5bc555d0c13e169a2dfc13c26f97c12b7e876\",\"relevance\":120,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9fc6da7c9a336e2f87965410347060f68e6eac61053584a333bb806e9555c747\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/econjournals.com\\/index.php\\/irmm\\/article\\/view\\/9698; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2146-4405; 2146-4405; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/d044fe7acd634e959bb5a966deb151d4\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/d044fe7acd634e959bb5a966deb151d4\",\"title\":\"Measuring Employee Happiness in the UAE \\u2013 Integrating Organisational Data into the National Statistics\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Measuring happiness is a complicated process as the concept of happiness cannot be universally defined, collectively experienced or scientifically measured. Further, the lag between when happiness is experienced and when a happiness research report is produced makes intervention efforts ineffective and occasionally redundant. In the current literature, confusions exist in terms of definitions of happiness, well-being and whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an accurate measure of a nation\\u2019s development. Within the organisational context however, little research is carried out on happiness leading whilst at the practical level, some nations including the United Arab Emirates and Bhutan, are currently promoting several happiness initiatives in order to become a happier nation and, perhaps, influence the country\\u2019s productivity. We have proposed a simple data collection approach at the organisational level that will collect daily happiness data per each employee. The micro data collection process is different from the big data normally gathered by the state departments in the sense that it is timely, captures the individualized account of happiness which, we recommend, should be correlated with organisational productivity and fed into the overall national statistics on Gross National Product (GNP) and public well-being.

To enhance an individual???s happiness, we need to be aware of what situations and environmental conditions are conducive for happiness and explore the values of happiness we pursue. This study investigated the types of happiness expressed by Korean people using a mixed-method approach. Personal in-depth (n = 15) and focus group (n = 16) interviews were conducted with people who reported feeling a high level of happiness. Happiness categorization was conducted using Q methodology (n = 63). Subsequently, we surveyed 999 nationally representative samples of Korean adults to generalize the results of the Q analysis. The findings revealed seven types of adult happiness in Korea: (1) Self-actualization, (2) Belongingness, (3) Mission, (4) Social recognition, (5) Enjoyment, (6) Material success, and (7) Parenting. The combined results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that in Korea, people pursuing money or social success feel the unhappiest, whereas people pursuing a mission or sense of belonging feel the happiest. In conclusion, we discussed the need for happiness literacy education, to provide each adult an opportunity to understand the type of happiness they pursue.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-03\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Doh, Young Yim; Chung, Ji-Bum\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholarworks.unist.ac.kr\\/handle\\/201301\\/31512\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"71b6369740e6a7bd48506d5a46ce5e020fba2b05692ecfeda15133d1dc27fb31\",\"relevance\":118,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"91521c9f6ffa77bbad9d444fbcb4fd56f9bcb48a128c29cae6cf77016b5b8548\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ijellh.com\\/OJS\\/index.php\\/OJS\\/article\\/view\\/10417\\/8641; https:\\/\\/ijellh.com\\/OJS\\/index.php\\/OJS\\/article\\/view\\/10417; doi:10.24113\\/ijellh.v8i2.10417\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ijellh.com\\/OJS\\/index.php\\/OJS\\/article\\/view\\/10417; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24113\\/ijellh.v8i2.10417\",\"title\":\"A Lexical Analysis of Words Signifying Happiness in Dickens' Novel Oliver Twist\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Being a transient state, happiness extends from the highest degree of pleasure to the lowest one.

In choosing to frame my question with the word 'happiness', I am guided by the desire to draw some comparative lessons for Western philosophy. 'Happiness' has been a central concept in Western ethics, and especially in Aristotelian and utilitarian ethics. The early Chinese concept most relevant to discussion of Mengzi and Zhuangzi concerns a specific form of happiness designated by the word le, which is best rendered as 'contentment'. For both Mengzi and Zhuangzi, there is a reflective dimension of happiness that consists in acceptance of the inevitable transformations of life and death, though these two thinkers chart very different paths to such acceptance. Mengzi holds that it lies in identification with a moral cause much larger than the self. Zhuangzi is profoundly skeptical about the viability of such a path to contentment. He instead offers identification with a world that transcends human good and evil, and a way to live in the present that can be deeply satisfying. One interesting outcome of both their discussions of achieving happiness is that both come to question the importance of happiness as a personal goal.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-04-13T01:29:27Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wong, DB\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10161\\/20418\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"df489c10e69a07a0efef5cb9ea255495700e088e89a37d228cd29b26822220db\",\"relevance\":116,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"315c0d721b8d88b5c6e7cba317f9968dcca2184f3b80a8c54960cbe59324ccbe\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/nsuworks.nova.edu\\/tqr\\/vol25\\/iss3\\/8; https:\\/\\/nsuworks.nova.edu\\/cgi\\/viewcontent.cgi?article=3804&context=tqr\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/nsuworks.nova.edu\\/tqr\\/vol25\\/iss3\\/8; https:\\/\\/nsuworks.nova.edu\\/cgi\\/viewcontent.cgi?article=3804&context=tqr\",\"title\":\"The Enduring Role of the Family in the Happiness of Puerto Ricans\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The study of happiness has grown in popularity over the past decades emerging in psychology partly as a reaction against the emphasis on negative topics such as mental illness and other forms of dysfunction.

Gun ownership and happiness in the United States (1973\\u20132018)\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Although there is no empirical evidence linking gun ownership with happiness, speculation is widespread. In this paper, we assess the association between gun ownership and happiness. We use 27 years of national cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey (1973\\u20132018) and logistic regression to model self-rated happiness as a function of gun ownership (n = 37,960). In bivariate and partially adjusted models, we observed that the odds of being very happy were higher for respondents who reported having a gun in their home. This association persisted with adjustments for age, gender, race\\/ethnicity, education, employment status, household income, financial satisfaction, financial change, number of children, religious attendance, political affiliation, urban residence, region of interview, and survey year. In our fully adjusted model, gun ownership was unrelated to happiness. The original association between gun ownership and happiness was entirely confounded by marital status. In other words, gun owners only appeared happier because they are more likely to be married, which increases happiness. In the first study of gun ownership and happiness, we found that people who own guns and people who do not own guns tend to exhibit similar levels of happiness. This general pattern was consistent across nearly three decades of national surveys, a wide range of subgroups, and different measures of happiness. Our analyses are important because they contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology of happiness. They also indirectly challenge theoretical perspectives and cultural narratives about how guns contribute to feelings of safety, power, and pleasure.\",\"published_in\":\"SSM: Population Health, Vol 10, Iss , Pp - (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Guns; Happiness; Mental health; Well-being; Marriage; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270; Social sciences (General); H1-99\",\"subject\":\"Guns; Happiness; Mental health; Well-being; Marriage; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Terrence D.

Although the literature suggests that happiness is predicted by multiple factors, the proposed hypothesis suggests the existence of an overlapping model in the different databases, whose common factors stand out from a panoply of other factors as determinants of happiness. Data were collected from three international and reliable databases and a multivariate analysis was conducted. It was found absence of a significant association between happiness and other aspects of existence, considered as determinants of happiness, namely, religion, work and significant others. It was also found that satisfaction with life and health are the main contributors to happiness, considering that the material issues of existence also explain happiness, although in a less expressive way. These variables can be the key to happiness. Investing in health policies, guaranteeing access to adequate income and freeing people from material constraints, involving body and money, may allow people to focus on the higher needs of the Maslow pyramid, and this may eventually lead to greater happiness. ; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/publishedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"2030 Agenda; Happiness; Psychological well-being; Health status; Inequality\",\"subject\":\" Happiness; Psychological well-being; Health status; Inequality\",\"authors\":\"Leite, \\u00c2ngela; e Sousa, H\\u00e9lder Fernando Pedrosa; Vidal, Diogo Guedes; Dinis, Maria Alzira Pimenta\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10284\\/8814\",\"oa_state\":\"0\",\"url\":\"8d3f098ab1c86cd443b32c8a3b13a293d50edd63bd3a85490472388dff90cff4\",\"relevance\":110,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"6aa549ef7f272d3abc639e326f5c2d36f91fa3d43b8621a081ec59235248d0d0\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.2147\\/PRBM.S248633; https:\\/\\/www.dovepress.com\\/racial-difference-in-the-relationship-between-health-and-happiness-in--peer-reviewed-article-PRBM\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.dovepress.com\\/racial-difference-in-the-relationship-between-health-and-happiness-in--peer-reviewed-article-PRBM\",\"title\":\"Racial Difference in the Relationship Between Health and Happiness in the United States\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Sharon Cobb,1 Arash Javanbakht,2 Ebrahim Khalifeh Soltani,3 Mohsen Bazargan,4,5 Shervin Assari4 1School of Nursing, Charles R Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 2Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA; 3Department of Political Science, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, MI, USA; 4Department of Family Medicine, Charles R Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 5Department of Family Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USACorrespondence: Shervin Assari Email assari@umich.eduBackground: Although health is a prerequisite for happiness, the salience of health for maintaining happiness may be diminished for Blacks when compared to Whites, a phenomenon which can be explained by the Black-White mental health paradox and minorities\\u2019 diminished returns.Aim: To understand if Black and White adult Americans differ in the effects of self-rated health (SRH) on happiness.Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the General Social Survey (GSS; 1972\\u2013 2018), a nationally representative survey in the US.

Approximately half the participants yielded low mind-wandering and negative affect scores and above-average happiness and positive affects scores. In addition, one in four scored above average in terms of mind-wandering and low in terms of happiness and positive effects. Finally, the mediating role played by affects was examined.

In his sonnets, Saadi points to features that create happiness and invites people towards serenity and contentment and far from sorrowfulness and grief. In Saadi's sonnets, the components of external and aphasic happiness as well as inner and infinitive happiness can be studied. The outer components of happiness, such as enjoying the beauties of nature and spring, pleasurable memories, being in the company of friends, songs, music and dance; also additionally, inner components of happiness comprising of goodness, justice, etc. Hence, the most imperative factor in regard to happiness is love. In this article, in addition to the external happiness factors mentioned, the main factor of the manifestation of joyfulness which is love will be discussed. Love is considered as the gem of Iranian painting in such a way that it is impossible to isolate the theme from the structure of the painting.

However measuring happiness has been elusive and until now has almost exclusively been done by asking survey questions about self-perceived happiness. We propose a novel approach, tracking happiness and stress through changes in body signals with a smartwatch, the \\u201cHappimeter\\u201d. It predicts individual emotions from sensor data collected by an Android Wear smartwatch, such as acceleration, heartbeat, and activity. The Happimeter was used over three months in the innovation lab of a bank with 22 employees to measure individual happiness, activity, and stress. The participants were randomly divided into an experimental and a control group of similar size. Both groups wore the watch and entered their subjective happiness, activity and stress levels several times a day. The user-entered ratings were then used to train a machine learning system using the sensors of the smartwatch to subsequently automatically predict happiness, activity, and stress. The experimental group received ongoing feedback about their mood and which activity, sensor signals, or other people, made them happier or unhappier, while the control group did not get any feedback about their predicted and manually entered emotions. Just like in quantum physics we observed a \\u201cHeisenberg Effect\\u201d, where the participants made aware of their measurements changed their behavior: Members of the experimental group that received happiness feedback were 16% happier, and 26% more active than the control group at the end of the experiment. No effect was observed for stress.\",\"published_in\":\"Springer Singapore\",\"year\":\"2020-06-26T12:33:37Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Roessler, Jannik; Gloor, Peter A.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1721.1\\/126358\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"2a78371574173933069ee21599a4eda0e2fa3ebbfc02425d4b2c0ae886f54d4a\",\"relevance\":101,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"cbb2b235a1952a93d78953fd7a60a2b032b1f96464b7688c7af0cca17abb9aa7\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/1660-4601\\/17\\/5\\/1502; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1660-4601; 1660-4601; doi:10.3390\\/ijerph17051502; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a27180abf4514b74b33a68952ef318e0\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17051502; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a27180abf4514b74b33a68952ef318e0\",\"title\":\"What Types of Happiness Do Korean Adults Pursue?\\u2014Comparison of Seven Happiness Types\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Although Korea has achieved successful economic, social, cultural, and technological development over the past decades, Korean people do not seem to be particularly happy. To enhance an individual\\u2019s happiness, we need to be aware of what situations and environmental conditions are conducive for happiness and explore the values of happiness we pursue. This study investigated the types of happiness expressed by Korean people using a mixed-method approach. Personal in-depth ( n = 15) and focus group ( n = 16) interviews were conducted with people who reported feeling a high level of happiness. Happiness categorization was conducted using Q methodology ( n = 63). Subsequently, we surveyed 999 nationally representative samples of Korean adults to generalize the results of the Q analysis. The findings revealed seven types of adult happiness in Korea: (1) Self-actualization, (2) Belongingness, (3) Mission, (4) Social recognition, (5) Enjoyment, (6) Material success, and (7) Parenting. The combined results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that in Korea, people pursuing money or social success feel the unhappiest, whereas people pursuing a mission or sense of belonging feel the happiest. In conclusion, we discussed the need for happiness literacy education, to provide each adult an opportunity to understand the type of happiness they pursue.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 5, p 1502 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"korean adult; types of happiness; subjectivity; q methodology; mixed-method approach; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"korean adult; types of happiness; subjectivity; q methodology; mixed-method approach; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Young Yim Doh; Ji-Bum Chung\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17051502\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"cbb2b235a1952a93d78953fd7a60a2b032b1f96464b7688c7af0cca17abb9aa7\",\"relevance\":100,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17051502\"},{\"id\":\"b71dcc25b4b6984757be2224f4a18d61ff437f5452662eb635c993eca3c85c65\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2306-5729\\/5\\/1\\/27; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2306-5729; 2306-5729; doi:10.3390\\/data5010027; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3ab141143a024a5c9c20a93dd05ea522\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/data5010027; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3ab141143a024a5c9c20a93dd05ea522\",\"title\":\"Data on Orientation to Happiness in Higher Education Institutions from Mexico and El Salvador\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Happiness-oriented people are vital in every society; this is a construct formed by three different types of happiness: pleasure, meaning, and engagement, and it is considered as an indicator of mental health. This study aims to provide data on the levels of orientation to happiness in higher-education teachers and students. The present paper contains data about the perception of this positive aspect in two Latin American countries, Mexico and El Salvador. Structure instruments to measure the orientation to happiness were administrated to 397 teachers and 260 students. This data descriptor presents descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation), internal consistency (Cronbach\\u2019s alpha), and differences (Student\\u2019s t-test) presented by country, population (teacher\\/student), and gender of their orientation to happiness and its three dimensions: meaning, pleasure, and engagement. Stepwise-multiple-regression-analysis results are also presented. Results indicated that participants from both countries reported medium\\u2212high levels of meaning and engagement happiness; teachers reported higher levels than those of students in these two dimensions. Happiness resulting from pleasure activities was the least reported in general. Males and females presented very similar levels of orientation to happiness. Only the population (teacher\\/student) showed a predictive relationship with orientation to happiness; however, the model explained a small portion of variance in this variable, which indicated that other factors are more critical when promoting orientation to happiness in higher-education institutions.\",\"published_in\":\"Data, Vol 5, Iss 1, p 27 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"university; happiness; pleasure; meaning; engagement; Bibliography.

The authors have been developing studies in this field and have chosen the happiness initiatives of the Dubai and UAE government to elaborate a case study. This paper, extracted from the wider investigation, presents a study based on government communication on the creation of the Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness. In the scope of this work we have chosen the National Happiness and Positivity Programme of the Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness. Using the technique of content analysis, through the use of webQDA software, the aim was to understand how the government communicated its strategy for happiness and which are the most used concepts to capture the attention of institutions and citizens. Consequently, the aim was to understand what actions the government has advocated to implement the said programme. The results imply that the concept of positivity has a focus that is very close and complementary to that of happiness. It is also inferred that the government intends to promote 'happiness as a way of life\\u2019, and also to involve the private sector in the National Happiness and Positivity Programme. Finally, the author\\u2019s contribution to this research field is to demonstrate that this model of positivity and sustainable happiness can be extensively implemented, including in the academy.\",\"published_in\":\"European Journal of Social Sciences; Vol 3 No 2 (2020): May - August 2020; 19-31 ; 2601-8640 ; 2601-8632\",\"year\":\"2020-05-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Ribeiro, Diamantino; Costa, Ant\\u00f3nio Pedro; Remondes, Jorge\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.euser.org\\/index.php\\/ejss\\/article\\/view\\/4675\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"d74056950124b79f41fd9b083264c321637523f57951563e51a86fecb001959e\",\"relevance\":98,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"211614df6c800124b979465a749bab3e3d69dc3a1fd700be1c6db80a1a7db61a\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/ushuluddin\\/alquran\\/article\\/view\\/2084\\/1700; http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/ushuluddin\\/alquran\\/article\\/view\\/2084; doi:10.14421\\/qh.2020.2102-01\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/ushuluddin\\/alquran\\/article\\/view\\/2084; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14421\\/qh.2020.2102-01\",\"title\":\"HIERARCHY OF HAPPINESS IN AL-SHA\\u2019R\\u00c2W\\u00ce\\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM AL-SUR\\u00dbR FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ABRAHAM MASLOW\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Happiness is the foremost goal of humans\\u2019 in running their activities. Even the fulfillment of the most basic needs is motivated to achieve it. However, the measure of happiness becomes very difficult to determine. In this context, al-Qur'an guides by mentioning various redactions that have the meaning of happiness, such as al-sur\\u00fbr. Therefore, this study aims to find the happiness fulfillment model described in the Qur'an. This study uses the interpretation of al-Sha'rawi, to narrow the scope of meaning, which is considered more relevant to the context of modern society. This research uses a literature study method with data analysis techniques using the approach of Abraham Maslow\\u2019s hierarchy of needs. This research concludes that al-Sha\\u2019r\\u00e2w\\u00ee interprets the word al-sur\\u00fbr as happiness in the world and the hereafter. In the world, happiness is achieved by enjoying sensory beauty, while in the afterlife, it will be achieved by behaving obediently in the world. The achievement of happiness is precisely obtained by fulfilling the needs following the hierarchy of happiness. At the early stage, happiness is achieved through theological belief. This belief will lead to sensory happiness in the world. At the uppermost stage, the peak of happiness can only be reached when humans meet their God.\",\"published_in\":\"Jurnal Studi Ilmu-ilmu Al-Qur'an dan Hadis; Vol 21, No 2 (2020): Juli; 255-272 ; 2548-4737 ; 1411-6855\",\"year\":\"2020-07-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"al-Sha\\u2018r\\u00e2w\\u00ee; Sur\\u00fbr; Humanistic; Psychology; Abraham Maslow\",\"subject\":\"al-Sha\\u2018r\\u00e2w\\u00ee; Sur\\u00fbr; Humanistic; Psychology; Abraham Maslow\",\"authors\":\"Halida, Putri Alfia\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/ushuluddin\\/alquran\\/article\\/view\\/2084\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"211614df6c800124b979465a749bab3e3d69dc3a1fd700be1c6db80a1a7db61a\",\"relevance\":97,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"47e1232b4dbe2186857e7930f73e92395b6838cae47d52d56156f202b3088bcf\",\"relation\":\"qt2fx681sm; https:\\/\\/escholarship.org\\/uc\\/item\\/2fx681sm\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/escholarship.org\\/uc\\/item\\/2fx681sm\",\"title\":\"The Cost of Being Too Patient\",\"paper_abstract\":\"We study the cost of being too patient on happiness.

The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ), that has 29 items, has been used widely to estimate personal happiness. The OHQ is used to quantify personal happiness based on an equal effectiveness assumption for all 29 items. Although the OHQ has been used by several studies, very few studies assess the contribution of the individual OHQ items in explaining personal happiness. The current study attempts to fill this gap by assessing the contribution of the individual OHQ items in explaining personal happiness as a latent variable. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to assess the relationship of the individual OHQ items in explaining personal happiness in Skudai, Johor, Malaysia. The significant OHQ items that are extracted from SEM results, are used to develop a new personal happiness measurement score. The SEM factor loading values are used to weight the extracted items. All usual clustering methods are used in this study and the most suitable one based on the higher silhouette value is chosen to cluster the proposed personal happiness index. Finally, the relationships between socio demographic factors and the proposed personal happiness index clusters are tested by Gamm and Pearson Chi-Square tests. The SEM results show that 16 out of the 29 OHQ items have poor associations with personal happiness and can be excluded from the model. Most of the non-significant items (items with low level of association) are negatively worded items and the majority of the significant items are related to personal attitudes. The proposed personal happiness index can help to save time and avoid confusion. ; The authors wish to thank all of those who have supported this research for their useful comments during its completion.

Currently, studies have identified a link between happiness and spiritual health; however, the effects of spiritual interventions on happiness have not been evaluated among the elderly. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of spiritual interventionson the happiness of the female elderly. Method: A total of 40 subjects were randomly allocated to two intervention and control groups in Madar Nursing Home in Sabzevar, Iran, in 2019. In the intervention group, spiritual interventionswere performed as active listening, supporting religious rituals, using supportive systems, and arousing hope for 4 weeks. The happiness level of the participants was assessed before, immediately after, and a month after the intervention using the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed by SPSS software (version 21) using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The mean scores of happiness before the intervention were 45.6\\u00b11.2 and 36.5\\u00b111.9 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. However, the scores altered to 65.1\\u00b19.9 and 35.3\\u00b19.4 immediately after the intervention, as well as 64.7\\u00b19.7 and 35.1\\u00b18.9 a month following the intervention, in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the groups by determining the effect of the happiness score before the intervention (P<0.0001). Implications for Practice: According to the obtained results, spiritual interventions increased the happiness level of the female elderly. Therefore, it is concluded that spiritual interventions can be considered practical approaches to improve the happiness of the elderly.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Evidence-Based Care, Vol 10, Iss 1, Pp 36-43 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"aging; happiness; nurse; spiritual care; Nursing; RT1-120; Gynecology and obstetrics; RG1-991\",\"subject\":\"aging; happiness; nurse; spiritual care; Nursing;  Gynecology and obstetrics; \",\"authors\":\"Toktam Ayyari; Raha Salehabadi; Sedighe Rastaghi; Mostafa Rad\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22038\\/ebcj.2020.44422.2205\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b13bbf35a096b953a8d6e1bce3ed76521fa77c6c8e309c46a9828138834f16ea\",\"relevance\":92,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22038\\/ebcj.2020.44422.2205\"},{\"id\":\"143aa16cd8a945cefb253405b1cc2a95cb8ba6838c4f9f6efb53379510e751b5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/jech.umsha.ac.ir\\/article-1-793-en.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2383-2312; doi:10.29252\\/jech.7.2.119; 2383-2312; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/cecb4cba482941a381d68cfc0eba618d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.29252\\/jech.7.2.119; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/cecb4cba482941a381d68cfc0eba618d\",\"title\":\"Relationship between Happiness and Mental Health with Social Capital among Health Workers\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Aims: Mental health, happiness, and social capital are important factors in optimal performance, entrepreneurship, reducing anxiety and depression, and increasing collaboration, agreement, intimacy, trust, and job satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between happiness and mental health with social capital of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences employees. Instrument & Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 200 employees of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in 2019. Data were collected using GHQ-28 General Health, Oxford Happiness and Social Capital questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 software using independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression. Finding: The mean age of participants was 40.40\\u00b18.18 years. The happiness of 57.5% of the participants was moderate, 54.5% had poor mental health, and 60.5% reported high social capital. Happiness and mental health predicted social capital and explained 9.2% of its variance changes. A good place to live had significant relationship with happiness and high social capital (p<0.01), but did not have relationship with mental health (p= 0.294). Also the mean scores of social capital, mental health, and happiness showed significant relationship with self-assessment of individual health, self-assessment of happiness, and life satisfaction (p<0.05). Conclusions: The healthier and happier people feel and the more satisfied they are with life, the more they enjoy mental health, happiness, and social capital.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Education and Community Health, Vol 7, Iss 2, Pp 119-125 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"mental health; happiness; social capital; employees; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"mental health; happiness; social capital; employees; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Babak Moeini; Forouzan Rezapur-Shahkolai; Leili Tapak; Azam Geravandi; Shahryar Parsamajd\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.29252\\/jech.7.2.119\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"143aa16cd8a945cefb253405b1cc2a95cb8ba6838c4f9f6efb53379510e751b5\",\"relevance\":91,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.29252\\/jech.7.2.119\"},{\"id\":\"fdf431ebeefc6bd7c483b7c2c6d0b6236ce7c54be6c4c95d2ff6ee6d838a42fc\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/hira.hope.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/3078\\/1\\/JOHS%202020%20hira.pdf; Lopez-Perez, B. and Zuffiano, A.

To address this gap, we used a mixed-method approach, to investigate if the conceptualizations of happiness at school of 744 British children and adolescents could signal differences in autonomy, competence, and relatedness. An initial coding of the responses showed thirteen conceptualizations (i.e., positive feelings, harmony\\/balance, leisure, friends, getting good grades, non-violence, moral actions, purpose, autonomy, competence, teachers, emotional support, and learning). Log-linear models showed that some of the conceptualizations differed across both age groups and gender. Latent class analysis showed that happiness conceptualizations could be classified in five different groups. Interestingly, whereas for children there were no differences; for adolescents, there were differences between classes in their levels of autonomy and relatedness. The implications of these findings for promoting students' well-being at school are discussed.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-05-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Lopez-Perez, B.; Zuffiano, A.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hira.hope.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/3078\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"fdf431ebeefc6bd7c483b7c2c6d0b6236ce7c54be6c4c95d2ff6ee6d838a42fc\",\"relevance\":90,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"c278debbbaf04998ddc16bab9cb591c65b9ff8f1f3c4b6a31ee85927991050d3\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/is.uv.mx\\/index.php\\/IS\\/article\\/view\\/2663\\/4567; https:\\/\\/is.uv.mx\\/index.php\\/IS\\/article\\/view\\/2663; doi:10.25009\\/is.v0i10.2663\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/is.uv.mx\\/index.php\\/IS\\/article\\/view\\/2663; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25009\\/is.v0i10.2663\",\"title\":\"Methodological proposal of the indicator \\\"Local Happiness Range\\\": association of indicators related to happiness, well-being and mood ; Propuesta metodol\\u00f3gica del indicador \\u201cGrado de Felicidad Local\\u201d, asociaci\\u00f3n de indicadores relativos a la felicidad, bienestar y estado de \\u00e1nimo\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The topic of happiness and well-being is approached to propose the Rank of Local Happiness indicator, which groups variables from INEGI and Banco de M\\u00e9xico as well as the World Happiness Report of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and other foundations.

More recently, several papers have looked beyond the traditional impact on economic growth and instead focused on the effects upon broader human welfare indicators. A separate empirical literature in recent decades has probed into the determinants of happiness and subjective well-being (using either country or household data). Our paper contributes to the literature by bringing these two empirical strands of research together. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that makes use of a large panel dataset to explore the links between changes in happiness across countries and several measures of resource wealth. Consistent with prior empirical evidence of a resource curse in oil-rich nations, we find that oil rents are negatively linked to improvements in happiness over time. This happiness \\u2018resource curse\\u2019 curse appears to be oil-specific and holds both for the levels as well as changes in happiness.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Ali, Sabna; Murshed, Syed Mansoob; Papyrakis, Elissaios\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/71374\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"587e1020e69462d22b12c7a89432f3e452697e52baa854cc15332d170e94e147\",\"relevance\":88,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"fe4ffbe598214bd45db808db71fc564878999e33d6435b749638ac809912b14d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2071-1050\\/12\\/11\\/4630; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2071-1050; doi:10.3390\\/su12114630; 2071-1050; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/60331977fae04ea48e3b7c133e8ff32a\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su12114630; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/60331977fae04ea48e3b7c133e8ff32a\",\"title\":\"Subjective Happiness is Associated with Objectively Evaluated Sleep Efficiency and Heart Rate during Sleep: An Exploratory Study Using Non-Contact Sheet Sensors\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between subjective happiness and subjective and objective sleep.

The present study is undertaken among 812 university students in order to examine the relationship between these variables. Methods: The sample included 812 university students - 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) - who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study. Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness. Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness.

Our main findings include the following. First, compared with the residents without higher education, residents with high education enjoy better health conditions, and residents' happiness also significantly affects their health conditions. Second, higher education may have a long-term impact on residents' health by affecting their happiness. Third, the results of grouping test demonstrate that, with the increase in age, the influence of residents' happiness on health is more pronounced, but the mechanism of higher education to improve health status by improving residents' happiness becomes unobvious. Furthermore, we adopt the Shapley value decomposition methodology to decompose the effects of various factors on residents' health.

While pollution can lead to unhappiness, will pollution abatement simply increase people's happiness? We analyze relevant happiness data collected before and after China's South-to-North Water Diversion Eastern Route Pollution Control Project to test this idea. The empirical results indicate that the pollution abatement project may not enhance happiness in its duration. Some residents may temporarily sacrifice something (such as employment or income), which offsets the positive effect of environmental improvement on their happiness. In subgroup analyses, rural people are found to benefit more from environmental improvement and suffer less in happiness compared with the urban, and so are low-income people compared with the high-income ones. The findings offer new insights into the costs of pollution in terms of happiness and highlight the need to abate pollution meticulously. \\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-07-17\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Jin, Zhizhou; Zeng, Saixing; Cao, Cong; Ma, Hanyang; Sun, Daxin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.nottingham.ac.uk\\/61479\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ac9637d0d09f4b31000a67a02b80c7a0d98f470ea3aed9265275a5e00de8b8c3\",\"relevance\":81,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"1ceffa8f1d1a16c339b0137c115c304a8c31ddfaa9a854585d8f774c8d25a0e5\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ejournal.upi.edu\\/index.php\\/insight\\/article\\/view\\/24598\\/11862; https:\\/\\/ejournal.upi.edu\\/index.php\\/insight\\/article\\/view\\/24598\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ejournal.upi.edu\\/index.php\\/insight\\/article\\/view\\/24598\",\"title\":\"PEMAAFAN DAN KEBAHAGIAAN PADA LANSIA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The purpose of this research is to identify the relationship between forgiveness and happiness in elderly at Wredha Abiyoso Pakem Yogyakarta house.

Therefore, we propose a novel approach of applying machine learning, a branch of the field of artificial intelligence, to a variety of information concerning people's lives (i.e., a lifelog). We asked a participant (a healthy young man) to record 55 lifelog items (e.g., positive mood, negative events, sleep time etc.) in his daily life for about eight months using smartphone apps and a smartwatch. We then constructed a predictor to estimate the degree of happiness from the multimodal lifelog data using a support vector machine, which achieved 82.6% prediction accuracy. This suggests that our approach can predict the behaviors that increase individuals' happiness in their daily lives, thereby contributing to improvement in their happiness.

measuring the economy of happiness. The theoretical basis of the economy of happiness involves the study of economic and other factors that determine human happiness, its dependence on the level of economic development of the country and determine the parameters for assessing the level of happiness of society as a whole. The \\u00abEasterlin paradox\\u00bb is highlighted, which notes the limited impact of economic growth on the level of happiness of citizens. Theeconomy of happiness at the macro level is due to happiness at the micro level, in our study - at the University. Its purpose was to determine the level and measure the factors of happiness, and their impact, taking into account modern network communications on the productivity and creativity of students and teachers. The article presents the results of a study of 323 students and teachers of various higher education institutions of Ukraine, interviewed using a cloud questionary created using Google Form. The results of the study showed that most students and teachers are satisfied with life in higher education, believe that the factors of happiness are material, spiritual and social benefits together. It has been proven that young people are generally happier than older people rate, their level of happiness in terms of their role at the University at 4 (on a 5-point scale). It isshown that almost half of the respondents use their time irrationally on the Internet, but they are satisfied with it; most of the respondents would feel happier if they used their time as productively as possible and had the opportunity to spend more time on self-development and creativity. ; \\u041e\\u043f\\u0438\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u043e

VARIOUSITY OF HAPPINESS PERSPECTIVE AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN LEARNING PROCESS\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Happiness is the ultimate goal of all activities. The desire for happiness makes humans look for the source of happiness that its existence is worthy of several elements of life. Education as one of the crucial elements of life has varied learning models that can increase the willingness of students to learn. The conscious effort to learn becomes more optimal in a happy psychological condition. This research discusses the ultimate happiness in the Koran described with scientific theories of happiness and explains the Quantum theory of happiness in the learning model. The research method used was literature study and content analysis as the data analysis technique. The results of this study indicate that first, happiness in the Koran was not caused by wealth but our faith as a believer. Second, there are endorphins in humans that emit happiness and calmness. Third, someone who is happy will have a change in thoughts, words, actions, facial expressions, and positive muscle activity. Fourth, the learning model that can create happy learning begins with creating happy emotions, giving both material and non-material rewards, and good habituation. Fifth, the understanding about happiness from various perspectives can provide a variety of positive developments in all aspects of life and will lead into a better life.\",\"published_in\":\"Psikis : Jurnal Psikologi Islami; Vol 6 No 1 (2020): Psikis : Jurnal Psikologi Islami; 102-115 ; Psikis; Vol 6 No 1 (2020): Psikis : Jurnal Psikologi Islami; 102-115 ; 2549-6468 ; 2502-728X\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Zuhdiyah, Zuhdiyah; Karolina, Asri; Oviyanti, Fitri; Aflisia, Noza; Hardiyanti, Yesa Satriya Dwi\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.radenfatah.ac.id\\/index.php\\/psikis\\/article\\/view\\/4692\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"d07f432e5fe2f80ab156eb628ff43b6db682f524c15c54a0f0af4f089c96c9dd\",\"relevance\":72,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"8950f8dd07b44be72e039bb0da40a76e7da149cce8dec57d40e12babd7e72dcf\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.dovepress.com\\/the-mediating-role-of-positive-and-negative-affects-in-the-relationshi-peer-reviewed-article-PRBM; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1179-1578; 1179-1578; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e67b1b9e731c475c990dc623f680251c\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e67b1b9e731c475c990dc623f680251c\",\"title\":\"The Mediating Role of Positive and Negative Affects in the Relationship Between Self-Esteem and Happiness\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Carlos Salavera,1,2 Pablo Us\\u00e1n,1,2 Pilar Teruel1,2 1Research Group OPIICS, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; 2Faculty of Education, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, SpainCorrespondence: Carlos SalaveraFaculty of Education, University of Zaragoza, c\\/Pedro Cerbuna, 12, Zaragoza 50009, SpainEmail salavera@unizar.esBackground: Affects, both positive and negative, can act as mediators between self-esteem and happiness. The present study is undertaken among 812 university students in order to examine the relationship between these variables.Methods: The sample included 812 university students \\u2013 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) \\u2013 who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study.Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness.Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness. More research is needed to examine to what extent these results can be extrapolated, and how to design measures to improve psychological health and well-being.Keywords: positive affects, negative affects, self-esteem, happiness, mediation\",\"published_in\":\"Psychology Research and Behavior Management, Vol Volume 13, Pp 355-361 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"positive affects; negative affects; self-esteem; happiness; mediation; Psychology; BF1-990; Industrial psychology; HF5548.7-5548.85\",\"subject\":\"positive affects; negative affects; self-esteem; happiness; mediation; Psychology;  Industrial psychology;; 7-\",\"authors\":\"Salavera C; Us\\u00e1n P; Teruel P\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e67b1b9e731c475c990dc623f680251c\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8950f8dd07b44be72e039bb0da40a76e7da149cce8dec57d40e12babd7e72dcf\",\"relevance\":71,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"1b12bacfa579052b042f09e221f351743cd3d495cc980e7cd48771cad30ad8b9\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.infad.eu\\/RevistaINFAD\\/OJS\\/index.php\\/IJODAEP\\/article\\/view\\/1871; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0214-9877; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2603-5987; 0214-9877; 2603-5987; doi:10.17060\\/ijodaep.2020.n1.v2.1871; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3359667b82f1440a85d333eb3a360028\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17060\\/ijodaep.2020.n1.v2.1871; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3359667b82f1440a85d333eb3a360028\",\"title\":\"The dimensions of happiness within the Oxford happiness questionnaire: developing a valid multidimensional measurement instrument for a portuguese sample\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The evidence that individuals\\u2019 happiness and general well-being are closely related has made happiness a frequently studied topic in the last decades. Studies showed that happiness has several dimensions and that these are dependent, amongst others, of cultural, economic, and social factors. The aim of this study was to validate a measure that identifies possible dimensions of happiness having as a starting point the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. An online questionnaire with socio-professional items and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was used. A sample of 1032 individuals from several Portuguese higher education establishments was collected, of which 581 (56.3%) were students, 257 (24.9%) were faculty members, and 194 (18.8%) were non-teaching staff. The sample was divided into two subsamples: sample 1 (n=508) and sample 2 (n=524). A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed on sample 1, followed by Covariance Based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM) on sample 2. The PCA presented results, consistent with the existing theory, for a three-factor model. CB-SEM identified several items with significant correlations with more than one latent variable, which eliminated from the model. A valid model (CFI= .95; TLI= .94; AGFI= .95; RMSEA= .04) was obtained, with three dimensions: Joy (six items); Positivism (nine items); and Reliability (two items). We conclude that a threedimension model is valid for the population under study and should be applied to other populations to deepen the conclusions. These three dimensions may serve as a basis to better understand what influences our happiness and propose interventions to promote it.\",\"published_in\":\"INFAD, Vol 2, Iss 1, Pp 465-478 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"happiness; joy; positivism; reliability; higher education; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"happiness; joy; positivism; reliability; higher education; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Ana Galv\\u00e3o; Sa\\u00fal Neves de Jesus; Marco Pinheiro; Jo\\u00e3o Viseu\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17060\\/ijodaep.2020.n1.v2.1871\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"1b12bacfa579052b042f09e221f351743cd3d495cc980e7cd48771cad30ad8b9\",\"relevance\":70,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17060\\/ijodaep.2020.n1.v2.1871\"},{\"id\":\"711b762dffd24660c4dfcc5b615d819858bd7fec8db334c81d5ca7a45a1e9cb5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/doisrpska.nub.rs\\/index.php\\/OIK\\/article\\/view\\/6683\\/6549; http:\\/\\/doisrpska.nub.rs\\/index.php\\/OIK\\/article\\/view\\/6683; doi:10.2478\\/eoik-2019-0014\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/doisrpska.nub.rs\\/index.php\\/OIK\\/article\\/view\\/6683; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.2478\\/eoik-2019-0014\",\"title\":\"CAN SLEEP DURATION HELP EXPLAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE HAPPINESS INDEX ACROSS NATIONS?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Inadequate sleep is an important public health problem that can affect one in every three adults;however, it received little attention in the economics of happiness research. The objective ofthis article is to examine whether sleep adequacy contributes to the explanation of variation inhappiness index levels across countries. Analysis was undertaken using ordinary least squaresregression method. The dependent variable is the self-reported happiness index developed by theGallup poll and published in the World Happiness Report. Two alternative model specificationswere used. The first included average sleep minutes per country, GDP per capita(purchasingpower parity), unemployment rate, and environmental performance index. The second modelspecification included average sleep minutes per country, GDP (purchasing power parity), andeconomic freedom index. Both model specifications met several robustness checks, and showedoverall significance and significant coefficients. Results showed that an increase in average sleepduration by 10 minutes is associated with an improvement in the happiness score by 0.1 and 0.15points in the first and second model specifications respectively, noting an average happiness scoreof 6.2 in the country sample. The conclusion that sleep duration contributes to explaining variationin happiness levels across countries is a call for policy makers to consider policies targetingimprovement in sleep adequacy as priority, and to direct more resources to further research inthe area of sleep economics.

Multiple linear regression tests were used with happiness and life satisfaction as dependent variables and quality of life as an independent variable. The results showed that the psychological and physical domains of quality of life were significant predictors of happiness and satisfaction of life, where the psychological domain proved significant in predicting all four-time points: happiness today (\\u03b2=0.039; p<0.05), happiness throughout life (\\u03b2=0.043; p<0.05), current life satisfaction (\\u03b2=0.034; p<0.05) and life satisfaction five years from now (\\u03b2=0.017; p<0.05).

There is broad evidence for a positive relationship between these three orientations and indicators of positive psychological functioning in a variety of life domains. However, their contribution to well-being at work is understudied. The main aim of this study was testing the relationship between self- and peer-rated orientations to happiness, work related well-being (work satisfaction, work stress), and coping strategies. Further possible mediating effects of the coping strategies on the relationship between orientations to happiness and well-being at work were also examined. The sample consisted of 372 German-speaking Swiss adults (60.3% female), aged between 18 and 65 years (M = 38.9, SD = 10.8) with a minimum of 40% full-time employment. For 100 persons, peer-ratings of the orientations to happiness were available. Our results showed that the life of engagement and, to a lesser extent, the life of meaning are related to work satisfaction. The life of pleasure was associated with lower levels of reported work stress. Further, positive associations between self- and peer-rated orientations to happiness (particularly pleasure) and adaptive coping strategies with stress were also found. Mediation analyses showed that the effects of engagement in general and content-related work satisfaction were mediated mainly by control and negative coping, while the association between meaning and resigned work satisfaction was mediated by positive coping. Negative coping fully mediated the association between the pleasurable life and work stress. Overall, our results indicate that employees\\u2019 orientations to happiness are of importance for experiencing well-being at work.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"coping; orientations to happiness; positive psychology; work satisfaction; work stress; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"coping; orientations to happiness; positive psychology; work satisfaction; work stress; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Nancy Tandler; Annette Krauss; Ren\\u00e9 T.

There is a timetable specific to the happiness that exists on the stage of history with human beings. All kinds of changes and transformations in the historical process affect the meanings attributed to happiness. Each era experiences happiness and interprets this experience according to its own perspective. Happiness, which was seen as a gift or chance of the Gods in the First Age and accepted to be experienced within the field determined by theology in the Middle Ages, is experienced as an emotion determined by the individual in the modern era. According to modern understanding, happiness is shaped by the idea of satisfying the desires and desires of the individual.

The current study investigates how goal alignment-the perception that you are engaging in activities that are aligned with personal goals-might be associated with state happiness. We hypothesized that people will feel happier when the activities they are performing are aligned with their goals. The study also explored the roles of goal progress and competence in this relation. Data on goal-activity alignment, goal progress, competence, and state happiness were collected in an experience-sampling study with undergraduate students (N = 159) and a survey study with Amazon MTurk workers (N = 252). Using multilevel analyses and regression analyses, results indicated that participants were happier when they were pursuing activities that were more closely aligned with their goals than when pursuing less goal-aligned activities; the results remained significant after accounting for goal progress. Participants who were more goal aligned on average reported greater state happiness; this effect was nonsignificant when goal progress was accounted for. Results suggest that goal alignment has a significant and unique effect on state happiness and that goal pursuit has very immediate benefits that begin as soon as individuals start doing actions helpful for their personal goals.\",\"published_in\":\"Motivation Science vol. 6 no. 2, pp. 156-163\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Experience sampling; Goal alignment; State happiness\",\"subject\":\"Experience sampling; Goal alignment; State happiness\",\"authors\":\"Wang, J.F.

In addition, the mediating effect of service-skill use is analyzed in the relationship between happiness at work and performance. Confirmatory factor analysis is used by means of structural equation models to assess the relationship between happiness at work, service-skill use, and cross-selling performance. A sample of 492 financial service employees is examined. Results reveal that happiness at work positively and directly affects cross-selling performance. The study also shows that service-skill use plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between happiness at work and cross-selling performance. This research expands the theory of the happy productive worker perspective based on the job demands-resources model and defines and conceptualizes service-skill use. Employees who are happier at work cross-sell better, but their service-skill use mediates the effect of happiness at work on cross-selling performance.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"happiness at work; service-skill use; performance; affective organizational commitment; job satisfaction; engagement; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"happiness at work; service-skill use; performance; affective organizational commitment; job satisfaction; engagement; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Andr\\u00e9s Salas-Vallina; Manoli Pozo-Hidalgo; Pedro R.

Catholic students in Northern Ireland hold a more positive attitude toward Christianity (higher levels of religious affect) than Catholic students in the Republic of Ireland. Nonetheless, there is no significant difference in levels of happiness (personal affect) between Catholic students in the two jurisdictions.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-04\",\"subject_orig\":\"BF Psychology; BX Christian Denominations\",\"subject\":\"BF Psychology; BX Christian Denominations\",\"authors\":\"Francis, Leslie J.; Byrne, G.; Lewis, C.

Studies of the impact of happiness and life satisfaction on life expectancy and mortality in the US are limited or non-existent. Using a national longitudinal dataset, we examined the association between levels of happiness\\/life satisfaction and US life expectancy and all-cause mortality. Methods: We analyzed the 2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) prospectively linked to 2001-2014 mortality records in the National Death Index (NDI) (N=30,377). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model survival time as a function of happiness, life satisfaction, and sociodemographic and behavioral covariates. Results: Life expectancies at age 18 among adults with high levels of happiness and life satisfaction were, respectively, 7.5 and 8.9 years higher compared to those with low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. In Cox models with 14 years of mortality follow-up, all-cause mortality risk was 82% higher (hazard ratio [HR]=1.82; 95% CI=1.59,2.08) in adults with little or no happiness, controlling for age, and 36% higher (HR=1.36; 95% CI=1.17,1.57) in adults with little\\/no happiness, controlling for sociodemographic, behavioral and health characteristics, when compared with adults reporting happiness all of the time. Mortality risk was 107% higher (HR=2.07; 95% CI=1.80,2.38) in adults who were very dissatisfied with their life, controlling for age, and 39% higher (HR=1.39; 95% CI=1.20,1.60) in adults who were very dissatisfied, controlling for all covariates, when compared with adults who were very satisfied. Conclusions and Global Health Implications: Adults with higher happiness and life satisfaction levels had significantly higher life expectancy and lower all-cause mortality risks than those with lower happiness and satisfaction levels. These findings underscore the significance of addressing subjective well-being in the population as a strategy for reducing all-cause mortality.

According to results of the research; it has not been seen a significant difference in happiness scores of teachers in terms of sex. It has been seen a significant difference in happiness scores in terms of other variables of branch, the thought of professional respectability, enjoying the occupation and the situation of reading book. It has been found that school counsellors have a higher happiness score than branch teachers have, teachers who like their occupations have a higher happiness score than they who do not like their occupations have, teachers who find teaching as a respectable occupation have a higher happiness score than they who do not find teaching as a respectable occupation have. On the other hand, it has been determined that the increase in the number of reading book is effective on happiness. When the relation between optimism and happiness has been investigated, it has been found that there are at a level of .64 relation besides, optimism predicts happiness about 41 percent.

The present study is undertaken among 812 university students in order to examine the relationship between these variables.Methods: The sample included 812 university students \\u2013 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) \\u2013 who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study.Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness.Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness. More research is needed to examine to what extent these results can be extrapolated, and how to design measures to improve psychological health and well-being.Keywords: positive affects, negative affects, self-esteem, happiness, mediation\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-04-28\",\"subject_orig\":\"Psychology Research and Behavior Management\",\"subject\":\"Psychology Research and Behavior Management\",\"authors\":\"Salavera,Carlos; Us\\u00c3\\u00a1n,Pablo; Teruel,Pilar\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.dovepress.com\\/the-mediating-role-of-positive-and-negative-affects-in-the-relationshi-peer-reviewed-article-PRBM\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8304160d6ceb1ad00563b6bbf560be2c57e478699be3a15ba5884b7e7ea98eee\",\"relevance\":51,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"afa6be1a0c1574bff9eb6c28f83c43c14403f016238ea30a424b608c4cfaef01\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/1052011; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/iid\\/issue\\/53743\\/553308; doi:10.18394\\/iid.553308\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/iid\\/issue\\/53743\\/553308; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.18394\\/iid.553308\",\"title\":\"Level and Perception of Happiness at Work: A Study on Private Sector Lawyers ; \\u00c7al\\u0131\\u015fma Mutlulu\\u011fu D\\u00fczeyi ve Alg\\u0131s\\u0131: \\u00d6zel Sekt\\u00f6r Avukatlar\\u0131 \\u00dczerine Bir Ara\\u015ft\\u0131rma\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The aim of this article is to measure happiness at work among private sector lawyers and to reveal how they express and perceive happiness at work.

Furthermore, the paper explores whether diversity management perceptions mediates the relationship between workplace happiness and organisational citizenship behaviour. Design\\/Methodology\\/Approach: A total of 260 questionnaire from a number of public hospitals in Egypt were analysed using both t-test and Structural Equation Modelling. Findings\\/ Results: We found that female physicians perceive diversity management policies\\/protocols more positively than their male colleagues. Moreover, gender has no or little effect on physicians\\u2019 perceptions of workplace happiness. We also found that workplace happiness positively affects physicians\\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour, and finally, diversity management practices can mediate the relationship between workplace happiness and physicians\\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour. Social and practical implications: We believe that managers can raise the feeling of workplace happiness among their staff if they maintain some personal relationships with physicians, care about the physicians\\u2019 work\\/life balance, promote after work gatherings, initiate coffee time talks, encourage open communication practices and more. Originality: The paper is based on the argument that although employees might be happy in the workplace through (engagement, job satisfaction, affective commitment), however their happiness will be unlikely reflected into a positive organizational citizenship behaviour towards their organisation, except (social exchange theory) they feel or perceive (equity theory) the overall practices of diversity management in that organization positively. Thus, studying the mediating effect of perceptions towards diversity management is mainly our contribution.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-05-13\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Mousa, Mohamed; Massoud, Hiba; Ayoubi, Rami M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10369\\/11104\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"3738dec0e7773e4ef94be544d006a547afd9423601936928c234558188acf0cf\",\"relevance\":49,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2fd4d41a814b519b1d53079cbcfa5a0ce4da60608d845274284a3b20a6e21e0a\",\"relation\":\"Verrastro, V., Ritella, G., Saladino, V., Pistella, J., Baiocco, R., & Fontanesi, L.

Results Using an actor-partner interdependence model, we found that when persons with type 2 diabetes were more confident in their spouse\\u2019s ability to provide them with support regarding their dietary self-care, they reported more relationship happiness. We also found that when their spouse without diabetes was more confident in their own abilities to provide such support to their partner, they reported more relationship happiness. However, the person with diabetes\\u2019 confidence in their spouse\\u2019s support abilities and the spouse\\u2019s confidence in their own support abilities were not associated with the other partner\\u2019s relationship happiness.

It draws attention to the two-sided aspect of happiness, physical, on the one hand, and spiritual on the other. It is concluded that it is very difficult for us to achieve the maximum and permanent degree of happiness or complete happiness. We may assume the weight and responsibility of achieving maximum happiness but, like Sisyphus, carrying the gigantic stone to the top of the mountain over and over again, we can never stay there, in that ideal or emotional territory that we know little about and that is shaped like an asymptote. With regard to the possibility of being happier to a greater or lesser extent, the proposal of Abraham Maslow\\u2019s gradual pyramid is suggestive.

The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the relationships between physical activity and life satisfaction and happiness in young, middle-aged, and older adults while controlling for demographic characteristics, and (2) the relationships between age and life satisfaction and happiness for different physical activity levels. A total of 2345 healthy adults were recruited. Demographic characteristic, physical activity, life satisfaction, and happiness were collected. Participants were divided into young, middle-aged, and older adult groups based on age, and physical activity was categorized as high, moderate, and low. After controlling for demographic characteristics, participants with high and moderate activity levels had significantly higher life satisfaction and happiness than those with a low activity level across the total population and the three age groups. Age squared was a significant predictor of a positive curvilinear between age and life satisfaction and happiness. Physical activity was significantly related to life satisfaction and happiness in young, middle-aged, and older adults. In addition, life satisfaction and happiness increased with increasing age. The results support the promotion of physical activity.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 4817, p 4817 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"exercise; happiness; life satisfaction; life span; physical activity subjective well-being; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"exercise; happiness; life satisfaction; life span; physical activity subjective well-being; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Hsin-Yu An; Wei Chen; Cheng-Wei Wang; Hui-Fei Yang; Wan-Ting Huang; Sheng-Yu Fan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17134817\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"6f1ba14e634ce2f4c884376f95f176181bee1088d7ffd9ddc3d2893c8a969fc0\",\"relevance\":43,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17134817\"},{\"id\":\"6e2b4d452953431f49b2d2ed8320bdb1c327235ab32aedcf51968bc52ee1d3f1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/jurnal.iainkediri.ac.id\\/index.php\\/happiness\\/article\\/view\\/1888\\/909; https:\\/\\/jurnal.iainkediri.ac.id\\/index.php\\/happiness\\/article\\/view\\/1888\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/jurnal.iainkediri.ac.id\\/index.php\\/happiness\\/article\\/view\\/1888\",\"title\":\"RELIGIUSITAS DAN STRES MENGHADAPI UJIAN NASIONAL PADA SISWA SMA KELAS XII\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Ujian Nasional is one of the biggest stressor for the 12th grade high school students.

Comparing forecasted and in-the-moment eating happiness revealed a significant discrepancy whose magnitude was affected by dispositional expectations and the variability of the experience.

Seventy-three participants (67.12% women, M age = 41.85 years) used a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment to assess their food intake and eating happiness over 14 days.

Comparing forecasted and in-the-moment eating happiness revealed a significant discrepancy whose magnitude was affected by dispositional expectations and the variability of the experience.

In terms of reliability, internal consistency reliability was satisfactory for the IHS. Evidence of criterion-related validity showed that the IHS was positively related to the externality of happiness and negative affect and was negatively related to personality traits and dimensions of psychological well-being. Concerning incremental validity, the results indicated that inflexibility of happiness accounted for a significant amount of variance in predicting domains of psychological wellbeing - purpose in life, personal growth and positive relations over and above the personality traits.

Results: OLR analysis detected four items across gender and two items across marital status to function differentially.

The main purpose of this study is to determine the process of reconstruction of happiness in blind people through Islamic guidance. This research uses a qualitative method with a phenomenological approach; the process of data analysis uses the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis technique. The subjects of the study were the blind who were members of ITMI (Indonesian Moslem Blind Association) and actively in Islamic guidance. The process of selecting subjects uses a purposive sampling method. The results showed that Islamic guidance had a positive influence in the process of reconstructing the happiness of the blind. Various processes of cognition and affection can be explored well during the process of Islamic guidance. The process of reconstructing happiness in the blind people goes through six stages, beginning with the stage of negative emotional conditions such as despair and anxiety, feeling isolated from the social environment, and then undertaking the process of finding meaning in life and reconstructing happiness.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Advanced Guidance and Counseling; Vol 1, No 1 (2020); 39-57 ; 2746-1521 ; 2746-1513 ; 10.2158\\/jagc.2020.1.1\",\"year\":\"2020-06-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"reconstruction of happiness; happiness; islamic guidance; blind; rekonstruksi kebahagiaan; kebahagiaan; bimbingan islami; tunanetra\",\"subject\":\"reconstruction of happiness; happiness; islamic guidance; blind; rekonstruksi kebahagiaan; kebahagiaan; bimbingan islami; tunanetra\",\"authors\":\"Himawanti, Izza; Hidayatullah, Ahmad; Setiyono, Andhi\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.walisongo.ac.id\\/index.php\\/agc\\/article\\/view\\/5768\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a353146ed1a2904240be6201aa9b40460e3f63c67a359d136f5dfecd8e8846fb\",\"relevance\":13,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"d4a4580f0d05514dfc4e9c8d93d6adea5870411b24f89b451c9c295db91067b0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fpubh.2020.00346\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2296-2565; 2296-2565; doi:10.3389\\/fpubh.2020.00346; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6bae8bac1bc44bbc8bb563e1562e1ea6\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpubh.2020.00346; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6bae8bac1bc44bbc8bb563e1562e1ea6\",\"title\":\"Validation of Global Self-Rated Health and Happiness Measures Among Older People in the Yilan Study, Taiwan\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: Single-item measures of physical and mental health are feasible for older adults, but their validity for that age group is unclear. This study tested validity of a global self-rated health and a global self-rated happiness measure in a large sample of community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan.Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 3,982 men and women aged 65 or older in Yilan, Taiwan, provided data on global self-rated health and happiness using 100-point numerical scales. The Physical Component Summary of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2) and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale were used to test the validity of the self-rated health item. The Mental Component of that 12-item scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were validators regarding the self-rated happiness item. Criterion validity was tested using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2).Results: The correlations between the self-rated health and happiness measures and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2) validators were positive and statistically significant, supporting convergent validity. Sufficient divergent validity was demonstrated through the negative and significant relationship between the self-rated health item and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale scores and the negative and significant relationship between the self-rated happiness item and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Optimal cut-off scores for physical and mental health states depended on age and gender.Conclusion: The global self-rated health and happiness measures were validated. Cut-off scores for evaluating older adults' physical and mental health should be age- and gender-specific.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Public Health, Vol 8 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"health-related quality of life; older adults; self-rated health; self-rated happiness; validation; Yilan study; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"health-related quality of life; older adults; self-rated health; self-rated happiness; validation; Yilan study; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Yen-Huai Lin; Hsi-Chung Chen; Nai-Wei Hsu; Pesus Chou\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpubh.2020.00346\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"d4a4580f0d05514dfc4e9c8d93d6adea5870411b24f89b451c9c295db91067b0\",\"relevance\":12,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpubh.2020.00346\"},{\"id\":\"14c9bc6de9d7fe100766367f3a1004082d34e05dd4e2b50e4cd1c645612a9956\",\"relation\":\"Lara, R.; V\\u00e1zquez, M.L.; Ogallar, A.; Godoy-Izquierdo, D.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between perceived occupational stressors and happiness among working women in Jordan. The sample consisted of (568) working women, ranging in age from 22 to 60 years from social community societies. Two questionnaires were used, perceived occupational stressors scale, and the Oxford Happiness Scale. The results showed that the levels of perceived occupational stressors and happiness among working women were moderate, and there were no statistical significant differences in the perceived occupational stressors levels, or happiness among working women in Jordan related to: age, marital status, scientific qualification, and years of experience, except age variable on work environment aspect at perceived occupational stressors in favor of women from (22-less 30). And a significant positive correlation between occupational stressors and Happiness. The researchers recommend that trainings should be provides to working women so that they may be able to perform their duties more effectively with more happiness.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u062f\\u0631\\u0627\\u0633\\u0627\\u062a: \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0644\\u0648\\u0645 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0627\\u0646\\u0633\\u0627\\u0646\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0648 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0627\\u062c\\u062a\\u0645\\u0627\\u0639\\u064a\\u0629; Vol 47, No 2 (2020) ; \\u062f\\u0631\\u0627\\u0633\\u0627\\u062a: \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0644\\u0648\\u0645 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0625\\u0646\\u0633\\u0627\\u0646\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0648\\u0627\\u0644\\u0625\\u062c\\u062a\\u0645\\u0627\\u0639\\u064a\\u0629; Vol 47, No 2 (2020) ; Dirasat: Human and Social Sciences; Vol 47, No 2 (2020) ; 2663-6190 ; 1026-3721\",\"year\":\"2020-07-23\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u0627\\u0644\\u0636\\u063a\\u0648\\u0637 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0647\\u0646\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u062f\\u0631\\u0643\\u0629\\u060c \\u0627\\u0644\\u0633\\u0639\\u0627\\u062f\\u0629\\u060c \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0631\\u0623\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0627\\u0645\\u0644\\u0629; ; Perceived Occupational Stressors; Happiness; Working Women\",\"subject\":\"\\u0627\\u0644\\u0636\\u063a\\u0648\\u0637 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0647\\u0646\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u062f\\u0631\\u0643\\u0629\\u060c \\u0627\\u0644\\u0633\\u0639\\u0627\\u062f\\u0629\\u060c \\u0627\\u0644\\u0645\\u0631\\u0623\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0627\\u0645\\u0644\\u0629; ; Perceived Occupational Stressors; Happiness; Working Women\",\"authors\":\"Banat, Suhaila Mahmoud; Sarhan, Wafa'a Younes; Abu Darwish, Muna Ali\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.ju.edu.jo\\/DirasatHum\\/article\\/view\\/104731\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"2799f36fd73dfbaf1cb66f33339ccde8d3b63e6d9e4d9f7ded3ba0588224b4aa\",\"relevance\":9,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2a55e7f3fefa73ed9703582289fab1267414607f01bc4fbf8ff036cc9a6ada2f\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.iiste.org\\/Journals\\/index.php\\/RHSS\\/article\\/view\\/51565\\/53288; https:\\/\\/www.iiste.org\\/Journals\\/index.php\\/RHSS\\/article\\/view\\/51565\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.iiste.org\\/Journals\\/index.php\\/RHSS\\/article\\/view\\/51565\",\"title\":\"Exploring the Nexus Between Culture, Values, Institutions, Happiness and Philanthropy: A Global Evidence\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of culture, values, institutions, and happiness on the world\\u2019s philanthropy. Culture is measured by Hofstede index (i.e. individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, long and short-run orientation, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and indulgence-restraint).

Institutions are measured by WGI (World Governance Indicators) and it consists of corruption, regulatory quality, accountability and voice, rule of law, political stability and government effectiveness, the sub-variables of happiness (index) are social support, freedom to take decisions and generosity and world\\u2019s philanthropy is measured by CAF (Charitable Aid Foundation) world giving index. We have gathered panel data (from the period 2010 to 2014) of CAF index, happiness index and WGI of 62 countries and cross-sectional data of CAF index, Hofstede index, WGI, happiness index and WVS of 24 countries. The result (of panel data) shows that there is a significant relation of WGI, social support and freedom of choice with CAF index whereas there is an insignificant connection between generosity and CAF index. The findings (of cross-sectional data of all factors combined) shows that there is a relation of the Hofstede index and happiness index with the CAF index while there is no linkage of WGI and WVS with the CAF index. The study suggests that charitable organizations should personify their value in order to build trust among the public. Countries should improve their governance because this will lead to equality and by doing this countries will also manage their resources efficiently and effectively.

Therefore, intervention seems to be essential specifically in elderly women suffered from moderate depression, with the aim of improving psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness. Therefore, the study aimed to determine the effectiveness of stress management training (SMT) on psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness in elderly women with moderate depression. The current study was a quasi-experimental with pretest-posttest and control group design. The statistical population included elderly women with depression residing in nursing homes of Tehran, Iran in 2019, among whom 60 women were selected through purposive sampling and inclusion criteria and allocated randomly into two equal groups. The experimental group received ten 90-minute sessions of SMT and the control group didn\\u2019t receive any training at the same time. Research tool included Najarian & Davodi\\u2019s psychological health scale, Sherer & et al.\\u2019s self-efficacy questionnaire, Argyle & Lu\\u2019s happiness questionnaire and Yesavage & Sheikh\\u2019s geriatric depression. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in the SPSS-22 software. Results indicated that there was a significant difference between experimental and control groups in terms of psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness in posttest phase. In other words, SMT resulted in improvement of psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness in elderly women with depression (P<0.01). Given the effectiveness of SMT, it is recommended that health professionals and therapists take advantages of STM along with other training methods in order to improve the elderly\\u2019s psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u0634\\u0646\\u0627\\u0633\\u06cc \\u067e\\u06cc\\u0631\\u06cc, Vol 6, Iss 1, Pp 53-64 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"stress management training; psychological health; self-efficacy; happiness; elderly women; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"stress management training; psychological health; self-efficacy; happiness; elderly women; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Parenaz Banisi\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22126\\/jap.2020.5192.1416\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"d19b81f63d2f0157c78280ace4ab00c9ae6d8fb9c2d893e454884e06fbf4aaa4\",\"relevance\":6,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22126\\/jap.2020.5192.1416\"},{\"id\":\"1ca61c8a9383ad530cf25d47e1cec80b191dc7c795d7e80a418af560fda08cb8\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1186\\/s12955-020-01416-x; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1477-7525; doi:10.1186\\/s12955-020-01416-x; 1477-7525; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a14c4f1e07e34c9aa5b1efb099e45ac8\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12955-020-01416-x; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a14c4f1e07e34c9aa5b1efb099e45ac8\",\"title\":\"The long and winding road to happiness: A randomized controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis of a positive psychology intervention for lonely people with health problems and a low socio-economic status\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the positive psychology intervention \\u2018Happiness Route\\u2019 compared to an active control condition in a vulnerable population with an accumulation of health and psychosocial problems. Methods We conducted a randomized, single-blind, actively-controlled, parallel group study in seven municipalities in the Netherlands. To be eligible, participants had to experience loneliness, health problems and low socio-economic status. Each group received several home visits by a counsellor (two in the control condition, two to six in the experimental condition). In the Happiness Route, a happiness-based approach was used, whereas the control condition used a traditional problem-based approach. The primary outcome was well-being, measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Results Fifty-eight participants were randomized to the Happiness Route, 50 to the control condition. Participants were severely lonely, had on average three health problems and less than 5% had paid work. The total MHC-SF score, emotional and social well-being, depression and loneliness improved significantly over the nine-month period in both conditions (p < .05), but there were no significant changes between the conditions across time. Languishing decreased significantly from 33% at baseline to 16% at follow-up among the Happiness Route participants but did not change significantly in the control condition. No significant improvement over time was found in psychological well-being, resilience, purpose in life, health-related quality of life and social participation. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that expected saved costs per QALY lost was \\u20ac219,948 for the Happiness Route, relative to the control condition. The probability was 83% that the Happiness Route was cost saving and 54% that the Happiness Route was cost-effective at a willingness to accept a threshold of \\u20ac100,000. Conclusions Mental health status of both groups improved considerably. However, we could not demonstrate that the Happiness Route yielded better health outcomes compared to the control condition. Nevertheless, the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the Happiness Route is an acceptable intervention from a health-economic point of view. Our results should be viewed in light of the fact that we could not include the planned number of participants. Trial registration Netherlands Trial Register: NTR3377 .

The purpose of the current study is to develop a scale in order to assess the potential for happiness of individuals related to the situation they have identified. The Happiness for Potential Scale is a Likert-type scale consisting of 11 items. The scale has three factors: expectation, knowledge and pleasure. To conduct the validity and reliability study of the scale, the data were collected from 306 participants. The analyses were conducted with 278 participants (63% females and 36% males) after missing observations and outliers were excluded from the data set. The participants&#039; mean age was 31.97, SD = 10.28. The results showed that the items were accumulated under three factors and explained 64.86% of the variance in The Potential for Happiness Scale. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha coefficient was calculated as .65 for expectation factor (3 items), .64 for knowledge factor (3 items) and .88 for pleasure (expression) factor and .86 for the total scale. Based on the findings from the analyses, it could be concluded that the scale which was developed in order to determine the potential for happiness of individuals is a valid and reliable measurement tool. ; Bu ara\\u015ft\\u0131rman\\u0131n konusunu olu\\u015fturan \\u201cmutluluk potansiyeli\\u201d, mutluluk d\\u00fczeyinin de\\u011fi\\u015fkenli\\u011fine (durumluk mutluluk) odakl\\u0131 olan ve mutluluk yaratma ihtimali ile ilgilenen g\\u00f6r\\u00fc\\u015fe dayan\\u0131r ve ki\\u015finin i\\u00e7inde bulundu\\u011fu durumdan doyum sa\\u011flamas\\u0131n\\u0131, sevin\\u00e7 duymas\\u0131n\\u0131 ifade eder.

Starting from ancient times, people today, and people in the future always want the same thing as happiness. The concept of happiness is not something new for both the world of Sufism and philosophy, therefore the concept of happiness experiences the dynamic development of the concept. Hamka is one of the scholars in Indonesia who discusses the concept of happiness, but Hamka has its own characteristics in explaining happiness. According to Hamka, happiness actually exists in every human being, happiness can be achieved from inside, not from outside, happiness that comes from outside of ourself is only as a complement to happiness inside, happiness can be achieved if humans always hone and develop tools which can be used to achieve happiness and these tools are religion, reason, and mind. These three things have a relationship with each other, if humans are able to develop these three things then humans can achieve happiness in their lives. In achieving happiness, these three things can be applied by using several methods namely zuhud, sincere, qana\\u2019ah and tawakal. The background of this research will explain the concept of happiness in the modern mysticism of Hamka. This research is a library research, and to make it more functional and useful, this paper will be equipped by a description method, interpretation and analysis of data in detail for each problem raised, therefore it can obtain a comprehensive understanding. happiness; zuhud; Sufism; philosophy Refleksi: Jurnal Filsafat dan Pemikiran Islam; Vol 19, No 2 (2019); 205-220 ; 2548-4745 ; 1411-9951 Arrasyid, Arrasyid\"},{\"id\":\"9fc6da7c9a336e2f87965410347060f68e6eac61053584a333bb806e9555c747\",\"content\":\"Measuring Employee Happiness in the UAE \\u2013 Integrating Organisational Data into the National Statistics Measuring happiness is a complicated process as the concept of happiness cannot be universally defined, collectively experienced or scientifically measured. Further, the lag between when happiness is experienced and when a happiness research report is produced makes intervention efforts ineffective and occasionally redundant. In the current literature, confusions exist in terms of definitions of happiness, well-being and whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an accurate measure of a nation\\u2019s development. Within the organisational context however, little research is carried out on happiness leading whilst at the practical level, some nations including the United Arab Emirates and Bhutan, are currently promoting several happiness initiatives in order to become a happier nation and, perhaps, influence the country\\u2019s productivity. We have proposed a simple data collection approach at the organisational level that will collect daily happiness data per each employee. The micro data collection process is different from the big data normally gathered by the state departments in the sense that it is timely, captures the individualized account of happiness which, we recommend, should be correlated with organisational productivity and fed into the overall national statistics on Gross National Product (GNP) and public well-being.

To enhance an individual???s happiness, we need to be aware of what situations and environmental conditions are conducive for happiness and explore the values of happiness we pursue. This study investigated the types of happiness expressed by Korean people using a mixed-method approach. Personal in-depth (n = 15) and focus group (n = 16) interviews were conducted with people who reported feeling a high level of happiness. Happiness categorization was conducted using Q methodology (n = 63). Subsequently, we surveyed 999 nationally representative samples of Korean adults to generalize the results of the Q analysis. The findings revealed seven types of adult happiness in Korea: (1) Self-actualization, (2) Belongingness, (3) Mission, (4) Social recognition, (5) Enjoyment, (6) Material success, and (7) Parenting. The combined results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that in Korea, people pursuing money or social success feel the unhappiest, whereas people pursuing a mission or sense of belonging feel the happiest. In conclusion, we discussed the need for happiness literacy education, to provide each adult an opportunity to understand the type of happiness they pursue.

In choosing to frame my question with the word 'happiness', I am guided by the desire to draw some comparative lessons for Western philosophy. 'Happiness' has been a central concept in Western ethics, and especially in Aristotelian and utilitarian ethics. The early Chinese concept most relevant to discussion of Mengzi and Zhuangzi concerns a specific form of happiness designated by the word le, which is best rendered as 'contentment'. For both Mengzi and Zhuangzi, there is a reflective dimension of happiness that consists in acceptance of the inevitable transformations of life and death, though these two thinkers chart very different paths to such acceptance. Mengzi holds that it lies in identification with a moral cause much larger than the self. Zhuangzi is profoundly skeptical about the viability of such a path to contentment. He instead offers identification with a world that transcends human good and evil, and a way to live in the present that can be deeply satisfying. One interesting outcome of both their discussions of achieving happiness is that both come to question the importance of happiness as a personal goal.

However, the most common way to study happiness and well-being has been using scales that do not allow access to the comments or descriptions of the participants, reducing our comprehension of this phenomenon to numbers. In order to contribute to the study of happiness from a cultural perspective and to understand how Puerto Ricans describe their particular meaning of happiness, a two-phase qualitative descriptive design study was conducted before and after hurricane Maria hit our country.

We collected data on the happiness from 145 Hadza, and compared it with data obtained from 156 Poles, representing Westernized society. Participants were asked to answer four simple questions from Subjective Happiness Scale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999).

Our findings also show that sex was not related to happiness in both populations, while age was a negative predictor of happiness, but only among Poles.

Gun ownership and happiness in the United States (1973\\u20132018) Although there is no empirical evidence linking gun ownership with happiness, speculation is widespread. In this paper, we assess the association between gun ownership and happiness. We use 27 years of national cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey (1973\\u20132018) and logistic regression to model self-rated happiness as a function of gun ownership (n = 37,960). In bivariate and partially adjusted models, we observed that the odds of being very happy were higher for respondents who reported having a gun in their home. This association persisted with adjustments for age, gender, race\\/ethnicity, education, employment status, household income, financial satisfaction, financial change, number of children, religious attendance, political affiliation, urban residence, region of interview, and survey year. In our fully adjusted model, gun ownership was unrelated to happiness. The original association between gun ownership and happiness was entirely confounded by marital status. In other words, gun owners only appeared happier because they are more likely to be married, which increases happiness. In the first study of gun ownership and happiness, we found that people who own guns and people who do not own guns tend to exhibit similar levels of happiness. This general pattern was consistent across nearly three decades of national surveys, a wide range of subgroups, and different measures of happiness. Our analyses are important because they contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology of happiness. They also indirectly challenge theoretical perspectives and cultural narratives about how guns contribute to feelings of safety, power, and pleasure.

As part of well-being, the pursuit of happiness should be understood as a fundamental human goal for all nations and integrate the public policy objectives. The aim of this study is to find the variables explaining happiness in order to provide scientific knowledge to be addressed in public policies. Although the literature suggests that happiness is predicted by multiple factors, the proposed hypothesis suggests the existence of an overlapping model in the different databases, whose common factors stand out from a panoply of other factors as determinants of happiness. Data were collected from three international and reliable databases and a multivariate analysis was conducted. It was found absence of a significant association between happiness and other aspects of existence, considered as determinants of happiness, namely, religion, work and significant others. It was also found that satisfaction with life and health are the main contributors to happiness, considering that the material issues of existence also explain happiness, although in a less expressive way. These variables can be the key to happiness. Investing in health policies, guaranteeing access to adequate income and freeing people from material constraints, involving body and money, may allow people to focus on the higher needs of the Maslow pyramid, and this may eventually lead to greater happiness. ; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/publishedVersion 2030 Agenda; Happiness; Psychological well-being; Health status; Inequality  Leite, \\u00c2ngela; e Sousa, H\\u00e9lder Fernando Pedrosa; Vidal, Diogo Guedes; Dinis, Maria Alzira Pimenta\"},{\"id\":\"6aa549ef7f272d3abc639e326f5c2d36f91fa3d43b8621a081ec59235248d0d0\",\"content\":\"Racial Difference in the Relationship Between Health and Happiness in the United States Sharon Cobb,1 Arash Javanbakht,2 Ebrahim Khalifeh Soltani,3 Mohsen Bazargan,4,5 Shervin Assari4 1School of Nursing, Charles R Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 2Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA; 3Department of Political Science, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, MI, USA; 4Department of Family Medicine, Charles R Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 5Department of Family Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USACorrespondence: Shervin Assari Email assari@umich.eduBackground: Although health is a prerequisite for happiness, the salience of health for maintaining happiness may be diminished for Blacks when compared to Whites, a phenomenon which can be explained by the Black-White mental health paradox and minorities\\u2019 diminished returns.Aim: To understand if Black and White adult Americans differ in the effects of self-rated health (SRH) on happiness.Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the General Social Survey (GSS; 1972\\u2013 2018), a nationally representative survey in the US.

Approximately half the participants yielded low mind-wandering and negative affect scores and above-average happiness and positive affects scores. In addition, one in four scored above average in terms of mind-wandering and low in terms of happiness and positive effects. Finally, the mediating role played by affects was examined.

This paper aims to analyze the effect of working hours on happiness in Indonesia by using cross-section data sourced from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) wave 5 of 2014. The model is divided into quadratic models and grouped working hours; the methods used in this paper were the ordered logit for the primary model and the ordinary least square for comparison. The results showed that a quadratic pattern of working hours, where initially working hours would increase happiness, but after reaching a certain peak point, the addition of working hours would cause a decrease in happiness.

In his sonnets, Saadi points to features that create happiness and invites people towards serenity and contentment and far from sorrowfulness and grief. In Saadi's sonnets, the components of external and aphasic happiness as well as inner and infinitive happiness can be studied. The outer components of happiness, such as enjoying the beauties of nature and spring, pleasurable memories, being in the company of friends, songs, music and dance; also additionally, inner components of happiness comprising of goodness, justice, etc. Hence, the most imperative factor in regard to happiness is love. In this article, in addition to the external happiness factors mentioned, the main factor of the manifestation of joyfulness which is love will be discussed. Love is considered as the gem of Iranian painting in such a way that it is impossible to isolate the theme from the structure of the painting. This article relies on library studies and is based on a descriptive and content analysis method. Research questions: 1. To what extent is happiness reflected and manifested in Iranian paintings? 2. What effect has the concept of happiness had on the structure of the paintings? Research aims: 1. A study of the concept of happiness expressed in Saadi's sonnets manifested in Iranian painting. 2.

However measuring happiness has been elusive and until now has almost exclusively been done by asking survey questions about self-perceived happiness. We propose a novel approach, tracking happiness and stress through changes in body signals with a smartwatch, the \\u201cHappimeter\\u201d. It predicts individual emotions from sensor data collected by an Android Wear smartwatch, such as acceleration, heartbeat, and activity. The Happimeter was used over three months in the innovation lab of a bank with 22 employees to measure individual happiness, activity, and stress. The participants were randomly divided into an experimental and a control group of similar size. Both groups wore the watch and entered their subjective happiness, activity and stress levels several times a day. The user-entered ratings were then used to train a machine learning system using the sensors of the smartwatch to subsequently automatically predict happiness, activity, and stress. The experimental group received ongoing feedback about their mood and which activity, sensor signals, or other people, made them happier or unhappier, while the control group did not get any feedback about their predicted and manually entered emotions. Just like in quantum physics we observed a \\u201cHeisenberg Effect\\u201d, where the participants made aware of their measurements changed their behavior: Members of the experimental group that received happiness feedback were 16% happier, and 26% more active than the control group at the end of the experiment.

To enhance an individual\\u2019s happiness, we need to be aware of what situations and environmental conditions are conducive for happiness and explore the values of happiness we pursue. This study investigated the types of happiness expressed by Korean people using a mixed-method approach. Personal in-depth ( n = 15) and focus group ( n = 16) interviews were conducted with people who reported feeling a high level of happiness. Happiness categorization was conducted using Q methodology ( n = 63). Subsequently, we surveyed 999 nationally representative samples of Korean adults to generalize the results of the Q analysis. The findings revealed seven types of adult happiness in Korea: (1) Self-actualization, (2) Belongingness, (3) Mission, (4) Social recognition, (5) Enjoyment, (6) Material success, and (7) Parenting. The combined results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that in Korea, people pursuing money or social success feel the unhappiest, whereas people pursuing a mission or sense of belonging feel the happiest. In conclusion, we discussed the need for happiness literacy education, to provide each adult an opportunity to understand the type of happiness they pursue. korean adult; types of happiness; subjectivity; q methodology; mixed-method approach; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 5, p 1502 (2020) Young Yim Doh; Ji-Bum Chung\"},{\"id\":\"b71dcc25b4b6984757be2224f4a18d61ff437f5452662eb635c993eca3c85c65\",\"content\":\"Data on Orientation to Happiness in Higher Education Institutions from Mexico and El Salvador Happiness-oriented people are vital in every society; this is a construct formed by three different types of happiness: pleasure, meaning, and engagement, and it is considered as an indicator of mental health.

The authors have been developing studies in this field and have chosen the happiness initiatives of the Dubai and UAE government to elaborate a case study. This paper, extracted from the wider investigation, presents a study based on government communication on the creation of the Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness. In the scope of this work we have chosen the National Happiness and Positivity Programme of the Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness. Using the technique of content analysis, through the use of webQDA software, the aim was to understand how the government communicated its strategy for happiness and which are the most used concepts to capture the attention of institutions and citizens. Consequently, the aim was to understand what actions the government has advocated to implement the said programme. The results imply that the concept of positivity has a focus that is very close and complementary to that of happiness. It is also inferred that the government intends to promote 'happiness as a way of life\\u2019, and also to involve the private sector in the National Happiness and Positivity Programme. Finally, the author\\u2019s contribution to this research field is to demonstrate that this model of positivity and sustainable happiness can be extensively implemented, including in the academy.

Even the fulfillment of the most basic needs is motivated to achieve it. However, the measure of happiness becomes very difficult to determine. In this context, al-Qur'an guides by mentioning various redactions that have the meaning of happiness, such as al-sur\\u00fbr. Therefore, this study aims to find the happiness fulfillment model described in the Qur'an. This study uses the interpretation of al-Sha'rawi, to narrow the scope of meaning, which is considered more relevant to the context of modern society. This research uses a literature study method with data analysis techniques using the approach of Abraham Maslow\\u2019s hierarchy of needs. This research concludes that al-Sha\\u2019r\\u00e2w\\u00ee interprets the word al-sur\\u00fbr as happiness in the world and the hereafter. In the world, happiness is achieved by enjoying sensory beauty, while in the afterlife, it will be achieved by behaving obediently in the world. The achievement of happiness is precisely obtained by fulfilling the needs following the hierarchy of happiness. At the early stage, happiness is achieved through theological belief. This belief will lead to sensory happiness in the world. At the uppermost stage, the peak of happiness can only be reached when humans meet their God. al-Sha\\u2018r\\u00e2w\\u00ee; Sur\\u00fbr; Humanistic; Psychology; Abraham Maslow Jurnal Studi Ilmu-ilmu Al-Qur'an dan Hadis; Vol 21, No 2 (2020): Juli; 255-272 ; 2548-4737 ; 1411-6855 Halida, Putri Alfia\"},{\"id\":\"47e1232b4dbe2186857e7930f73e92395b6838cae47d52d56156f202b3088bcf\",\"content\":\"The Cost of Being Too Patient We study the cost of being too patient on happiness.

The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ), that has 29 items, has been used widely to estimate personal happiness. The OHQ is used to quantify personal happiness based on an equal effectiveness assumption for all 29 items. Although the OHQ has been used by several studies, very few studies assess the contribution of the individual OHQ items in explaining personal happiness. The current study attempts to fill this gap by assessing the contribution of the individual OHQ items in explaining personal happiness as a latent variable. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to assess the relationship of the individual OHQ items in explaining personal happiness in Skudai, Johor, Malaysia. The significant OHQ items that are extracted from SEM results, are used to develop a new personal happiness measurement score. The SEM factor loading values are used to weight the extracted items. All usual clustering methods are used in this study and the most suitable one based on the higher silhouette value is chosen to cluster the proposed personal happiness index. Finally, the relationships between socio demographic factors and the proposed personal happiness index clusters are tested by Gamm and Pearson Chi-Square tests. The SEM results show that 16 out of the 29 OHQ items have poor associations with personal happiness and can be excluded from the model. Most of the non-significant items (items with low level of association) are negatively worded items and the majority of the significant items are related to personal attitudes. The proposed personal happiness index can help to save time and avoid confusion. ; The authors wish to thank all of those who have supported this research for their useful comments during its completion.

Currently, studies have identified a link between happiness and spiritual health; however, the effects of spiritual interventions on happiness have not been evaluated among the elderly. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of spiritual interventionson the happiness of the female elderly. Method: A total of 40 subjects were randomly allocated to two intervention and control groups in Madar Nursing Home in Sabzevar, Iran, in 2019. In the intervention group, spiritual interventionswere performed as active listening, supporting religious rituals, using supportive systems, and arousing hope for 4 weeks. The happiness level of the participants was assessed before, immediately after, and a month after the intervention using the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed by SPSS software (version 21) using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The mean scores of happiness before the intervention were 45.6\\u00b11.2 and 36.5\\u00b111.9 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. However, the scores altered to 65.1\\u00b19.9 and 35.3\\u00b19.4 immediately after the intervention, as well as 64.7\\u00b19.7 and 35.1\\u00b18.9 a month following the intervention, in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the groups by determining the effect of the happiness score before the intervention (P<0.0001). Implications for Practice: According to the obtained results, spiritual interventions increased the happiness level of the female elderly. Therefore, it is concluded that spiritual interventions can be considered practical approaches to improve the happiness of the elderly. aging; happiness; nurse; spiritual care; Nursing; RT1-120; Gynecology and obstetrics; RG1-991 Journal of Evidence-Based Care, Vol 10, Iss 1, Pp 36-43 (2020) Toktam Ayyari; Raha Salehabadi; Sedighe Rastaghi; Mostafa Rad\"},{\"id\":\"143aa16cd8a945cefb253405b1cc2a95cb8ba6838c4f9f6efb53379510e751b5\",\"content\":\"Relationship between Happiness and Mental Health with Social Capital among Health Workers Aims: Mental health, happiness, and social capital are important factors in optimal performance, entrepreneurship, reducing anxiety and depression, and increasing collaboration, agreement, intimacy, trust, and job satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between happiness and mental health with social capital of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences employees. Instrument & Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 200 employees of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in 2019. Data were collected using GHQ-28 General Health, Oxford Happiness and Social Capital questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 software using independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression. Finding: The mean age of participants was 40.40\\u00b18.18 years. The happiness of 57.5% of the participants was moderate, 54.5% had poor mental health, and 60.5% reported high social capital. Happiness and mental health predicted social capital and explained 9.2% of its variance changes. A good place to live had significant relationship with happiness and high social capital (p<0.01), but did not have relationship with mental health (p= 0.294). Also the mean scores of social capital, mental health, and happiness showed significant relationship with self-assessment of individual health, self-assessment of happiness, and life satisfaction (p<0.05). Conclusions: The healthier and happier people feel and the more satisfied they are with life, the more they enjoy mental health, happiness, and social capital. mental health; happiness; social capital; employees; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270 Journal of Education and Community Health, Vol 7, Iss 2, Pp 119-125 (2020) Babak Moeini; Forouzan Rezapur-Shahkolai; Leili Tapak; Azam Geravandi; Shahryar Parsamajd\"},{\"id\":\"fdf431ebeefc6bd7c483b7c2c6d0b6236ce7c54be6c4c95d2ff6ee6d838a42fc\",\"content\":\"Children\\u2019s and Adolescents\\u2019 Happiness Conceptualizations at School and their Link with Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness Previous research on children\\u2019s and adolescents\\u2019happiness either focused on their conceptualisations or the link between self-reported happiness with different outcomes. However, very few studies have connected both approaches to better understand children\\u2019s and adolescents\\u2019 happiness. To address this gap, we used a mixed-method approach, to investigate if the conceptualizations of happiness at school of 744 British children and adolescents could signal differences in autonomy, competence, and relatedness. An initial coding of the responses showed thirteen conceptualizations (i.e., positive feelings, harmony\\/balance, leisure, friends, getting good grades, non-violence, moral actions, purpose, autonomy, competence, teachers, emotional support, and learning). Log-linear models showed that some of the conceptualizations differed across both age groups and gender. Latent class analysis showed that happiness conceptualizations could be classified in five different groups. Interestingly, whereas for children there were no differences; for adolescents, there were differences between classes in their levels of autonomy and relatedness. The implications of these findings for promoting students' well-being at school are discussed.

More recently, several papers have looked beyond the traditional impact on economic growth and instead focused on the effects upon broader human welfare indicators. A separate empirical literature in recent decades has probed into the determinants of happiness and subjective well-being (using either country or household data). Our paper contributes to the literature by bringing these two empirical strands of research together. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that makes use of a large panel dataset to explore the links between changes in happiness across countries and several measures of resource wealth. Consistent with prior empirical evidence of a resource curse in oil-rich nations, we find that oil rents are negatively linked to improvements in happiness over time. This happiness \\u2018resource curse\\u2019 curse appears to be oil-specific and holds both for the levels as well as changes in happiness.

Methods: The sample included 812 university students - 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) - who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study. Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness.

The empirical results indicate that the pollution abatement project may not enhance happiness in its duration. Some residents may temporarily sacrifice something (such as employment or income), which offsets the positive effect of environmental improvement on their happiness. In subgroup analyses, rural people are found to benefit more from environmental improvement and suffer less in happiness compared with the urban, and so are low-income people compared with the high-income ones.

Therefore, we propose a novel approach of applying machine learning, a branch of the field of artificial intelligence, to a variety of information concerning people's lives (i.e., a lifelog). We asked a participant (a healthy young man) to record 55 lifelog items (e.g., positive mood, negative events, sleep time etc.) in his daily life for about eight months using smartphone apps and a smartwatch. We then constructed a predictor to estimate the degree of happiness from the multimodal lifelog data using a support vector machine, which achieved 82.6% prediction accuracy. This suggests that our approach can predict the behaviors that increase individuals' happiness in their daily lives, thereby contributing to improvement in their happiness. Future studies examining the usability and clinical applicability of this approach would benefit from a larger and more diverse sample size. machine learning; lifelog; artificial intelligence; happiness; behavior  YamamotoI, Tetsuya; Yoshimoto, Junichiro; Murillo-Rodriguez, Eric; Machado, Sergio\"},{\"id\":\"c3f1ed15dc5250a7644bd7b7c8519e7d0a3814e83df0c0b046f2d07b7eb3ca1f\",\"content\":\"Modeling knowledge sharing and team performance in technology industry: the main and moderating effects of happiness This study complements previous literature by bridging activity theory and the broaden-and-build theory to examine how happiness (as an intrinsic driver) and knowledge sharing (as an extrinsic driver) influence team performance. The contributions of this study are twofolds. First, this study fills a research gap concerning what mediates the simultaneous influences of happiness and knowledge sharing on team performance. Second, both main and moderating effects of happiness in the development of team performance are explored in this study, which is rarely discussed in the literature. By surveying 116 teams from high-tech firms in Taiwan, this study opens a black box regarding the mediation of team proactivity and team proficiency and the moderation of happiness in the development of team performance. Lastly, managerial implications and limitations based on the empirical findings are provided.

We find no significant correlation between the two when we look at correlations across the entire distributions. However, turning to an extreme value theory (EVT) modeling of the tails of the non-normally distributed happiness distribution we find that during particularly depressing days the gold price often goes up. In a sense, gold is found to serve as a happiness-related safe haven, i.e. as a hedge against extreme unhappiness.

The phrase \\u201chappy people live longer\\u201d has been known. Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) can be used for the study for feeling of happiness. By functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMR), anterior right wedge region of the brain (precuneus) may be important for feeing happiness. Both of effective and functional connectivity of the right precuneus were positively associated with SHS scores. Consequently, happiness may be involved in SHS, structural neuroimaging, neurological study, positive psychological interventions, and so on.

The theoretical basis of the economy of happiness involves the study of economic and other factors that determine human happiness, its dependence on the level of economic development of the country and determine the parameters for assessing the level of happiness of society as a whole. The \\u00abEasterlin paradox\\u00bb is highlighted, which notes the limited impact of economic growth on the level of happiness of citizens. Theeconomy of happiness at the macro level is due to happiness at the micro level, in our study - at the University. Its purpose was to determine the level and measure the factors of happiness, and their impact, taking into account modern network communications on the productivity and creativity of students and teachers. The article presents the results of a study of 323 students and teachers of various higher education institutions of Ukraine, interviewed using a cloud questionary created using Google Form. The results of the study showed that most students and teachers are satisfied with life in higher education, believe that the factors of happiness are material, spiritual and social benefits together. It has been proven that young people are generally happier than older people rate, their level of happiness in terms of their role at the University at 4 (on a 5-point scale). It isshown that almost half of the respondents use their time irrationally on the Internet, but they are satisfied with it; most of the respondents would feel happier if they used their time as productively as possible and had the opportunity to spend more time on self-development and creativity. ; \\u041e\\u043f\\u0438\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u043e

of happiness. The theoretical basis of the economy of happiness involves the study of economic and other factors that determine human happiness, its dependence on the level of economic development of the country and determine the parameters for assessing the level of happiness of society as a whole. The \\u00abEasterlin paradox\\u00bb is highlighted, which notes the limited impact of economic growth on the level of happiness of citizens. Theeconomy of happiness at the macro level is due to happiness at the micro level, in our study - at the University. Its purpose was to determine the level and measure the factors of happiness, and their impact, taking into account modern network communications on the productivity and creativity of students and teachers. The article presents the results of a study of 323 students and teachers of various higher education institutions of Ukraine, interviewed using a cloud questionary created using Google Form. The results of the study showed that most students and teachers are satisfied with life in higher education, believe that the factors of happiness are material, spiritual and social benefits together. It has been proven that young people are generally happier than older people rate, their level of happiness in terms of their role at the University at 4 (on a 5-point scale). It isshown that almost half of the respondents use their time irrationally on the Internet, but they are satisfied with it; most of the respondents would feel happier if they used their time as productively as possible and had the opportunity to spend more time on self-development and creativity. ; \\u041e\\u043f\\u0438\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u043e

OF HAPPINESS PERSPECTIVE AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN LEARNING PROCESS Happiness is the ultimate goal of all activities. The desire for happiness makes humans look for the source of happiness that its existence is worthy of several elements of life. Education as one of the crucial elements of life has varied learning models that can increase the willingness of students to learn. The conscious effort to learn becomes more optimal in a happy psychological condition. This research discusses the ultimate happiness in the Koran described with scientific theories of happiness and explains the Quantum theory of happiness in the learning model. The research method used was literature study and content analysis as the data analysis technique. The results of this study indicate that first, happiness in the Koran was not caused by wealth but our faith as a believer. Second, there are endorphins in humans that emit happiness and calmness. Third, someone who is happy will have a change in thoughts, words, actions, facial expressions, and positive muscle activity. Fourth, the learning model that can create happy learning begins with creating happy emotions, giving both material and non-material rewards, and good habituation. Fifth, the understanding about happiness from various perspectives can provide a variety of positive developments in all aspects of life and will lead into a better life.

The present study is undertaken among 812 university students in order to examine the relationship between these variables.Methods: The sample included 812 university students \\u2013 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) \\u2013 who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study.Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness.Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness. More research is needed to examine to what extent these results can be extrapolated, and how to design measures to improve psychological health and well-being.Keywords: positive affects, negative affects, self-esteem, happiness, mediation positive affects; negative affects; self-esteem; happiness; mediation; Psychology; BF1-990; Industrial psychology; HF5548.7-5548.85 Psychology Research and Behavior Management, Vol Volume 13, Pp 355-361 (2020) Salavera C; Us\\u00e1n P; Teruel P\"},{\"id\":\"1b12bacfa579052b042f09e221f351743cd3d495cc980e7cd48771cad30ad8b9\",\"content\":\"The dimensions of happiness within the Oxford happiness questionnaire: developing a valid multidimensional measurement instrument for a portuguese sample The evidence that individuals\\u2019 happiness and general well-being are closely related has made happiness a frequently studied topic in the last decades. Studies showed that happiness has several dimensions and that these are dependent, amongst others, of cultural, economic, and social factors. The aim of this study was to validate a measure that identifies possible dimensions of happiness having as a starting point the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. An online questionnaire with socio-professional items and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was used. A sample of 1032 individuals from several Portuguese higher education establishments was collected, of which 581 (56.3%) were students, 257 (24.9%) were faculty members, and 194 (18.8%) were non-teaching staff. The sample was divided into two subsamples: sample 1 (n=508) and sample 2 (n=524). A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed on sample 1, followed by Covariance Based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM) on sample 2. The PCA presented results, consistent with the existing theory, for a three-factor model. CB-SEM identified several items with significant correlations with more than one latent variable, which eliminated from the model. A valid model (CFI= .95; TLI= .94; AGFI= .95; RMSEA= .04) was obtained, with three dimensions: Joy (six items); Positivism (nine items); and Reliability (two items). We conclude that a threedimension model is valid for the population under study and should be applied to other populations to deepen the conclusions. These three dimensions may serve as a basis to better understand what influences our happiness and propose interventions to promote it. happiness; joy; positivism; reliability; higher education; Psychology; BF1-990 INFAD, Vol 2, Iss 1, Pp 465-478 (2020) Ana Galv\\u00e3o; Sa\\u00fal Neves de Jesus; Marco Pinheiro; Jo\\u00e3o Viseu\"},{\"id\":\"711b762dffd24660c4dfcc5b615d819858bd7fec8db334c81d5ca7a45a1e9cb5\",\"content\":\"CAN SLEEP DURATION HELP EXPLAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE HAPPINESS INDEX ACROSS NATIONS? Inadequate sleep is an important public health problem that can affect one in every three adults;however, it received little attention in the economics of happiness research. The objective ofthis article is to examine whether sleep adequacy contributes to the explanation of variation inhappiness index levels across countries. Analysis was undertaken using ordinary least squaresregression method. The dependent variable is the self-reported happiness index developed by theGallup poll and published in the World Happiness Report. Two alternative model specificationswere used. The first included average sleep minutes per country, GDP per capita(purchasingpower parity), unemployment rate, and environmental performance index. The second modelspecification included average sleep minutes per country, GDP (purchasing power parity), andeconomic freedom index. Both model specifications met several robustness checks, and showedoverall significance and significant coefficients. Results showed that an increase in average sleepduration by 10 minutes is associated with an improvement in the happiness score by 0.1 and 0.15points in the first and second model specifications respectively, noting an average happiness scoreof 6.2 in the country sample. The conclusion that sleep duration contributes to explaining variationin happiness levels across countries is a call for policy makers to consider policies targetingimprovement in sleep adequacy as priority, and to direct more resources to further research inthe area of sleep economics. Previous studies in the area of happiness economics did not considersleep in explaining differences in happiness among countries, and previous studies in the area ofeconomics of sleep did not consider the happiness index at a global level.

Eudaimonic Orientation Moderates the Happiness Benefits of Prosocial Behavior Engaging in prosocial behavior is considered an effective way to increase happiness in a sustainable manner. However, there is insufficient knowledge about the conditions under which such a happiness effect occurs. From a person-activity congruence perspective, we proposed that an individual\\u2019s eudaimonic orientation moderates the effect of prosocial behavior on happiness, whereas hedonic orientation does not. For this purpose, 128 participants were assigned to play a game in which half of them were explained the benevolence impact of playing the game (the benevolence condition), and the other half played the same game without this knowledge (the control condition). Participants\\u2019 eudaimonic and hedonic orientations were assessed before the game, and their post-task happiness were measured after the game. The results showed that participants in the benevolence condition reported higher post-task positive affect than those in the control condition. Furthermore, this happiness effect was moderated by participants\\u2019 eudaimonic orientation\\u2014participants with high eudaimonic orientation reaped greater benefits from benevolence, and their hedonic orientation did not moderate the relationship between benevolence and happiness. The importance of the effect of person-activity congruence on happiness is discussed, along with the implications of these findings for sustainably pursuing happiness. happiness; prosocial behavior; eudaimonic orientation; hedonic orientation; person-activity congruence; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 4053, p 4053 (2020) Weipeng Lai; Zhixu Yang; Yanhui Mao; Qionghan Zhang; Hezhi Chen; Jianhong Ma\"},{\"id\":\"35e4e9b9ab68036874246eb850bf82438df61d8836c033f16422a2b7ab6e7a7b\",\"content\":\"Quality of Life as A Predictor of Happiness and Life Satisfaction This study aimed to find correlations between the quality of life, happiness, and life satisfaction of the general population of Bandung city. There were 370 participants with averageage of 20.7 years, mostly male (55.7%) and with a secondary level of education (SMP-SMA; 57.0%) who completed three questionnaires: (i) WHOQOL-BREF to measure quality of life, (ii) Happiness Thermometer to measure happiness, and (iii) Self-Anchoring Cantril Striving Scale to measure life satisfaction. Multiple linear regression tests were used with happiness and life satisfaction as dependent variables and quality of life as an independent variable. The results showed that the psychological and physical domains of quality of life were significant predictors of happiness and satisfaction of life, where the psychological domain proved significant in predicting all four-time points: happiness today (\\u03b2=0.039; p<0.05), happiness throughout life (\\u03b2=0.043; p<0.05), current life satisfaction (\\u03b2=0.034; p<0.05) and life satisfaction five years from now (\\u03b2=0.017; p<0.05). Physical domain was similar to psychological except for current life satisfaction (\\u03b2=0.029; 0.023; 0.014; p<0.05). The environmental domain had been shown to predict happiness throughout life significantly (\\u03b2=0.019; p<0.05) and life satisfaction five years from now (\\u03b2=-0.015; p<0.05). The social domain was not found to be a significant predictor. It can be concluded that improving the psychological and physical function of Indonesian people and their environmental conditions will lead them to a happier and more satisfying life. quality of life; happiness; indonesia; life satisfaction; Psychology; BF1-990 Jurnal Psikologi, Vol 47, Iss 2, Pp 93-103 (2020) Langgersari Elsari Novianti; Esti Wungu; Fredrick Dermawan Purba\"},{\"id\":\"a30161a76eaf36e8aad4068acf8f73781607f46e89acd2ef8d4bd8dff79ec44b\",\"content\":\"Authentic Happiness at Work: Self- and Peer-Rated Orientations to Happiness, Work Satisfaction, and Stress Coping The authentic happiness theory covers three basic orientations to happiness; namely, the life of pleasure (via hedonism); engagement (via flow-related experiences); and meaning (via eudaimonia). There is broad evidence for a positive relationship between these three orientations and indicators of positive psychological functioning in a variety of life domains. However, their contribution to well-being at work is understudied. The main aim of this study was testing the relationship between self- and peer-rated orientations to happiness, work related well-being (work satisfaction, work stress), and coping strategies. Further possible mediating effects of the coping strategies on the relationship between orientations to happiness and well-being at work were also examined. The sample consisted of 372 German-speaking Swiss adults (60.3% female), aged between 18 and 65 years (M = 38.9, SD = 10.8) with a minimum of 40% full-time employment. For 100 persons, peer-ratings of the orientations to happiness were available. Our results showed that the life of engagement and, to a lesser extent, the life of meaning are related to work satisfaction. The life of pleasure was associated with lower levels of reported work stress. Further, positive associations between self- and peer-rated orientations to happiness (particularly pleasure) and adaptive coping strategies with stress were also found. Mediation analyses showed that the effects of engagement in general and content-related work satisfaction were mediated mainly by control and negative coping, while the association between meaning and resigned work satisfaction was mediated by positive coping. Negative coping fully mediated the association between the pleasurable life and work stress. Overall, our results indicate that employees\\u2019 orientations to happiness are of importance for experiencing well-being at work. coping; orientations to happiness; positive psychology; work satisfaction; work stress; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Nancy Tandler; Annette Krauss; Ren\\u00e9 T.

There is a timetable specific to the happiness that exists on the stage of history with human beings. All kinds of changes and transformations in the historical process affect the meanings attributed to happiness. Each era experiences happiness and interprets this experience according to its own perspective. Happiness, which was seen as a gift or chance of the Gods in the First Age and accepted to be experienced within the field determined by theology in the Middle Ages, is experienced as an emotion determined by the individual in the modern era. According to modern understanding, happiness is shaped by the idea of satisfying the desires and desires of the individual.

To measure someone's happiness is not easy, many opinions have emerged. Some say happiness can be measured through the satisfaction of one's life, some say happiness is measured through one's income, education, and health. The number of people's opinions to measure one's happiness appears as an indicator of happiness. At present, there are 48 indicators. One of the most accurate is HPI. The HPI indicator is very important for a country to increase the happiness of its people. Example: life expectancy in a country will increase and unemployment will decrease because a person has extensive knowledge and knowledge that is needed both by himself and the company that will accept him as his employee. The purpose of this study is to find out how HDI influences, life expectancy, unemployment on the level of happiness of people in ASIA. In this study using secondary data sources conducted by taking HDI data, life expectancy, unemployment in ASIA, and HPI data on ASIA. The results of the analysis using quantitative methods indicate that the independent variables namely HDI, life expectancy, and unemployment.

The current study investigates how goal alignment-the perception that you are engaging in activities that are aligned with personal goals-might be associated with state happiness. We hypothesized that people will feel happier when the activities they are performing are aligned with their goals. The study also explored the roles of goal progress and competence in this relation. Data on goal-activity alignment, goal progress, competence, and state happiness were collected in an experience-sampling study with undergraduate students (N = 159) and a survey study with Amazon MTurk workers (N = 252). Using multilevel analyses and regression analyses, results indicated that participants were happier when they were pursuing activities that were more closely aligned with their goals than when pursuing less goal-aligned activities; the results remained significant after accounting for goal progress. Participants who were more goal aligned on average reported greater state happiness; this effect was nonsignificant when goal progress was accounted for. Results suggest that goal alignment has a significant and unique effect on state happiness and that goal pursuit has very immediate benefits that begin as soon as individuals start doing actions helpful for their personal goals.

The Mediating Role of Service-Skill Use The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between happiness at work and cross-selling performance in the banking sector. In addition, the mediating effect of service-skill use is analyzed in the relationship between happiness at work and performance. Confirmatory factor analysis is used by means of structural equation models to assess the relationship between happiness at work, service-skill use, and cross-selling performance. A sample of 492 financial service employees is examined. Results reveal that happiness at work positively and directly affects cross-selling performance. The study also shows that service-skill use plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between happiness at work and cross-selling performance. This research expands the theory of the happy productive worker perspective based on the job demands-resources model and defines and conceptualizes service-skill use. Employees who are happier at work cross-sell better, but their service-skill use mediates the effect of happiness at work on cross-selling performance. happiness at work; service-skill use; performance; affective organizational commitment; job satisfaction; engagement; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Andr\\u00e9s Salas-Vallina; Manoli Pozo-Hidalgo; Pedro R.

Studies of the impact of happiness and life satisfaction on life expectancy and mortality in the US are limited or non-existent. Using a national longitudinal dataset, we examined the association between levels of happiness\\/life satisfaction and US life expectancy and all-cause mortality. Methods: We analyzed the 2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) prospectively linked to 2001-2014 mortality records in the National Death Index (NDI) (N=30,377). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model survival time as a function of happiness, life satisfaction, and sociodemographic and behavioral covariates. Results: Life expectancies at age 18 among adults with high levels of happiness and life satisfaction were, respectively, 7.5 and 8.9 years higher compared to those with low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. In Cox models with 14 years of mortality follow-up, all-cause mortality risk was 82% higher (hazard ratio [HR]=1.82; 95% CI=1.59,2.08) in adults with little or no happiness, controlling for age, and 36% higher (HR=1.36; 95% CI=1.17,1.57) in adults with little\\/no happiness, controlling for sociodemographic, behavioral and health characteristics, when compared with adults reporting happiness all of the time. Mortality risk was 107% higher (HR=2.07; 95% CI=1.80,2.38) in adults who were very dissatisfied with their life, controlling for age, and 39% higher (HR=1.39; 95% CI=1.20,1.60) in adults who were very dissatisfied, controlling for all covariates, when compared with adults who were very satisfied. Conclusions and Global Health Implications: Adults with higher happiness and life satisfaction levels had significantly higher life expectancy and lower all-cause mortality risks than those with lower happiness and satisfaction levels. These findings underscore the significance of addressing subjective well-being in the population as a strategy for reducing all-cause mortality.

The sample of the research is composed of 540 (315 female, 225 male) branch teachers. In this study, \\u201cPersonal Information Form\\u201d, \\u201cOxford Happiness Questionnaire (Short Form)\\u201d and \\u201c Optimism Scale\\u201d were used as data collection tools. T - test for binary variables and ANOVA statistical technique for multiple variables were used in the analyses conducted. According to results of the research; it has not been seen a significant difference in happiness scores of teachers in terms of sex. It has been seen a significant difference in happiness scores in terms of other variables of branch, the thought of professional respectability, enjoying the occupation and the situation of reading book. It has been found that school counsellors have a higher happiness score than branch teachers have, teachers who like their occupations have a higher happiness score than they who do not like their occupations have, teachers who find teaching as a respectable occupation have a higher happiness score than they who do not find teaching as a respectable occupation have. On the other hand, it has been determined that the increase in the number of reading book is effective on happiness. When the relation between optimism and happiness has been investigated, it has been found that there are at a level of .64 relation besides, optimism predicts happiness about 41 percent. The results of the research have been discussed in accordance with the relevant literature and the suggestions have been offered.

The present study is undertaken among 812 university students in order to examine the relationship between these variables.Methods: The sample included 812 university students \\u2013 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) \\u2013 who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study.Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness.Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness. More research is needed to examine to what extent these results can be extrapolated, and how to design measures to improve psychological health and well-being.Keywords: positive affects, negative affects, self-esteem, happiness, mediation Psychology Research and Behavior Management  Salavera,Carlos; Us\\u00c3\\u00a1n,Pablo; Teruel,Pilar\"},{\"id\":\"afa6be1a0c1574bff9eb6c28f83c43c14403f016238ea30a424b608c4cfaef01\",\"content\":\"Level and Perception of Happiness at Work: A Study on Private Sector Lawyers ; \\u00c7al\\u0131\\u015fma Mutlulu\\u011fu D\\u00fczeyi ve Alg\\u0131s\\u0131: \\u00d6zel Sekt\\u00f6r Avukatlar\\u0131 \\u00dczerine Bir Ara\\u015ft\\u0131rma The aim of this article is to measure happiness at work among private sector lawyers and to reveal how they express and perceive happiness at work.

Furthermore, the paper explores whether diversity management perceptions mediates the relationship between workplace happiness and organisational citizenship behaviour. Design\\/Methodology\\/Approach: A total of 260 questionnaire from a number of public hospitals in Egypt were analysed using both t-test and Structural Equation Modelling. Findings\\/ Results: We found that female physicians perceive diversity management policies\\/protocols more positively than their male colleagues. Moreover, gender has no or little effect on physicians\\u2019 perceptions of workplace happiness. We also found that workplace happiness positively affects physicians\\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour, and finally, diversity management practices can mediate the relationship between workplace happiness and physicians\\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour. Social and practical implications: We believe that managers can raise the feeling of workplace happiness among their staff if they maintain some personal relationships with physicians, care about the physicians\\u2019 work\\/life balance, promote after work gatherings, initiate coffee time talks, encourage open communication practices and more. Originality: The paper is based on the argument that although employees might be happy in the workplace through (engagement, job satisfaction, affective commitment), however their happiness will be unlikely reflected into a positive organizational citizenship behaviour towards their organisation, except (social exchange theory) they feel or perceive (equity theory) the overall practices of diversity management in that organization positively. Thus, studying the mediating effect of perceptions towards diversity management is mainly our contribution.

Methods Forty-six couples, in which only one spouse has type 2 diabetes, completed questionnaires on perceptions of spousal support self-efficacy and relationship happiness. Results Using an actor-partner interdependence model, we found that when persons with type 2 diabetes were more confident in their spouse\\u2019s ability to provide them with support regarding their dietary self-care, they reported more relationship happiness. We also found that when their spouse without diabetes was more confident in their own abilities to provide such support to their partner, they reported more relationship happiness. However, the person with diabetes\\u2019 confidence in their spouse\\u2019s support abilities and the spouse\\u2019s confidence in their own support abilities were not associated with the other partner\\u2019s relationship happiness. Conclusions This study offers a unique dyadic perspective on the determinants of happiness for couples in which one spouse has type 2 diabetes. The perceived quality of spousal support appears to be associated with relationship happiness in committed couples managing diabetes, regardless of the actual support received or provided.

It draws attention to the two-sided aspect of happiness, physical, on the one hand, and spiritual on the other. It is concluded that it is very difficult for us to achieve the maximum and permanent degree of happiness or complete happiness. We may assume the weight and responsibility of achieving maximum happiness but, like Sisyphus, carrying the gigantic stone to the top of the mountain over and over again, we can never stay there, in that ideal or emotional territory that we know little about and that is shaped like an asymptote. With regard to the possibility of being happier to a greater or lesser extent, the proposal of Abraham Maslow\\u2019s gradual pyramid is suggestive.

In the Koran, there are many verses related to the dynamics of the human psyche which theoretically can be used as a basis for psychotherapy to overcome problems. Al-Quran offers a solution for an anxious soul to find peace, either through reading or writing taken from the alQur'an text.

To test the factor structure, the sample was split into two subsamples. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted in the first subsample and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was next conducted in the second subsample. The results of EFA and CFA yielded a single factor structure and measurement invariance across gender was successfully established. In terms of reliability, internal consistency reliability was satisfactory for the IHS. Evidence of criterion-related validity showed that the IHS was positively related to the externality of happiness and negative affect and was negatively related to personality traits and dimensions of psychological well-being. Concerning incremental validity, the results indicated that inflexibility of happiness accounted for a significant amount of variance in predicting domains of psychological wellbeing - purpose in life, personal growth and positive relations over and above the personality traits. Collectively, these results suggest that the IHS is a reliable and valid instrument to measure the inflexibility of happiness beliefs among undergraduate students from Turkey.

A brief review of previous studies on OHI showed the lack of evaluation of OHI fairness\\/equivalence in measuring happiness among identified groups. Methods: To examine the psychometric properties and measurement invariance of the OHI, responses of 500 university students were analyzed using item response theory and ordinal logistic regression (OLR). Relevant measures of effect size were utilized to interpret the results. Differential test functioning was also evaluated to determine whether there is an overall bias at the test level. Results: OLR analysis detected four items across gender and two items across marital status to function differentially. An assessment of effect sizes implied negligible differences for practical considerations. Conclusions: This study was a significant step towards providing theoretical and practical information regarding the assessment of happiness by presenting adequate evidence regarding the psychometric properties of OHI.

This research uses a qualitative method with a phenomenological approach; the process of data analysis uses the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis technique. The subjects of the study were the blind who were members of ITMI (Indonesian Moslem Blind Association) and actively in Islamic guidance. The process of selecting subjects uses a purposive sampling method. The results showed that Islamic guidance had a positive influence in the process of reconstructing the happiness of the blind. Various processes of cognition and affection can be explored well during the process of Islamic guidance. The process of reconstructing happiness in the blind people goes through six stages, beginning with the stage of negative emotional conditions such as despair and anxiety, feeling isolated from the social environment, and then undertaking the process of finding meaning in life and reconstructing happiness. reconstruction of happiness; happiness; islamic guidance; blind; rekonstruksi kebahagiaan; kebahagiaan; bimbingan islami; tunanetra Journal of Advanced Guidance and Counseling; Vol 1, No 1 (2020); 39-57 ; 2746-1521 ; 2746-1513 ; 10.2158\\/jagc.2020.1.1 Himawanti, Izza; Hidayatullah, Ahmad; Setiyono, Andhi\"},{\"id\":\"d4a4580f0d05514dfc4e9c8d93d6adea5870411b24f89b451c9c295db91067b0\",\"content\":\"Validation of Global Self-Rated Health and Happiness Measures Among Older People in the Yilan Study, Taiwan Background: Single-item measures of physical and mental health are feasible for older adults, but their validity for that age group is unclear.

The Physical Component Summary of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2) and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale were used to test the validity of the self-rated health item. The Mental Component of that 12-item scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were validators regarding the self-rated happiness item. Criterion validity was tested using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2).Results: The correlations between the self-rated health and happiness measures and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2) validators were positive and statistically significant, supporting convergent validity. Sufficient divergent validity was demonstrated through the negative and significant relationship between the self-rated health item and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale scores and the negative and significant relationship between the self-rated happiness item and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

Culture is measured by Hofstede index (i.e. individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, long and short-run orientation, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and indulgence-restraint). The measurement of value is WVS (World Value Survey) and it consists of the emotion of happiness, active\\/ inactive membership of a church or religious organization, important in life; religion, confidence on charitable\\/ humanitarian organization and active\\/ inactive membership of charitable\\/ humanitarian organization. Institutions are measured by WGI (World Governance Indicators) and it consists of corruption, regulatory quality, accountability and voice, rule of law, political stability and government effectiveness, the sub-variables of happiness (index) are social support, freedom to take decisions and generosity and world\\u2019s philanthropy is measured by CAF (Charitable Aid Foundation) world giving index. We have gathered panel data (from the period 2010 to 2014) of CAF index, happiness index and WGI of 62 countries and cross-sectional data of CAF index, Hofstede index, WGI, happiness index and WVS of 24 countries. The result (of panel data) shows that there is a significant relation of WGI, social support and freedom of choice with CAF index whereas there is an insignificant connection between generosity and CAF index. The findings (of cross-sectional data of all factors combined) shows that there is a relation of the Hofstede index and happiness index with the CAF index while there is no linkage of WGI and WVS with the CAF index. The study suggests that charitable organizations should personify their value in order to build trust among the public. Countries should improve their governance because this will lead to equality and by doing this countries will also manage their resources efficiently and effectively.

Therefore, intervention seems to be essential specifically in elderly women suffered from moderate depression, with the aim of improving psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness. Therefore, the study aimed to determine the effectiveness of stress management training (SMT) on psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness in elderly women with moderate depression. The current study was a quasi-experimental with pretest-posttest and control group design. The statistical population included elderly women with depression residing in nursing homes of Tehran, Iran in 2019, among whom 60 women were selected through purposive sampling and inclusion criteria and allocated randomly into two equal groups. The experimental group received ten 90-minute sessions of SMT and the control group didn\\u2019t receive any training at the same time. Research tool included Najarian & Davodi\\u2019s psychological health scale, Sherer & et al.\\u2019s self-efficacy questionnaire, Argyle & Lu\\u2019s happiness questionnaire and Yesavage & Sheikh\\u2019s geriatric depression. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in the SPSS-22 software. Results indicated that there was a significant difference between experimental and control groups in terms of psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness in posttest phase. In other words, SMT resulted in improvement of psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness in elderly women with depression (P<0.01). Given the effectiveness of SMT, it is recommended that health professionals and therapists take advantages of STM along with other training methods in order to improve the elderly\\u2019s psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness. stress management training; psychological health; self-efficacy; happiness; elderly women; Psychology; BF1-990 \\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u0634\\u0646\\u0627\\u0633\\u06cc \\u067e\\u06cc\\u0631\\u06cc, Vol 6, Iss 1, Pp 53-64 (2020) Parenaz Banisi\"},{\"id\":\"1ca61c8a9383ad530cf25d47e1cec80b191dc7c795d7e80a418af560fda08cb8\",\"content\":\"The long and winding road to happiness: A randomized controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis of a positive psychology intervention for lonely people with health problems and a low socio-economic status Abstract Background Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the positive psychology intervention \\u2018Happiness Route\\u2019 compared to an active control condition in a vulnerable population with an accumulation of health and psychosocial problems.

Each group received several home visits by a counsellor (two in the control condition, two to six in the experimental condition). In the Happiness Route, a happiness-based approach was used, whereas the control condition used a traditional problem-based approach. The primary outcome was well-being, measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Results Fifty-eight participants were randomized to the Happiness Route, 50 to the control condition. Participants were severely lonely, had on average three health problems and less than 5% had paid work. The total MHC-SF score, emotional and social well-being, depression and loneliness improved significantly over the nine-month period in both conditions (p < .05), but there were no significant changes between the conditions across time. Languishing decreased significantly from 33% at baseline to 16% at follow-up among the Happiness Route participants but did not change significantly in the control condition. No significant improvement over time was found in psychological well-being, resilience, purpose in life, health-related quality of life and social participation. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that expected saved costs per QALY lost was \\u20ac219,948 for the Happiness Route, relative to the control condition. The probability was 83% that the Happiness Route was cost saving and 54% that the Happiness Route was cost-effective at a willingness to accept a threshold of \\u20ac100,000. Conclusions Mental health status of both groups improved considerably. However, we could not demonstrate that the Happiness Route yielded better health outcomes compared to the control condition. Nevertheless, the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the Happiness Route is an acceptable intervention from a health-economic point of view. Our results should be viewed in light of the fact that we could not include the planned number of participants. Trial registration Netherlands Trial Register: NTR3377 . Registered 2 Apr 2012.

The purpose of the current study is to develop a scale in order to assess the potential for happiness of individuals related to the situation they have identified. The Happiness for Potential Scale is a Likert-type scale consisting of 11 items. The scale has three factors: expectation, knowledge and pleasure. To conduct the validity and reliability study of the scale, the data were collected from 306 participants. The analyses were conducted with 278 participants (63% females and 36% males) after missing observations and outliers were excluded from the data set. The participants&#039; mean age was 31.97, SD = 10.28. The results showed that the items were accumulated under three factors and explained 64.86% of the variance in The Potential for Happiness Scale. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha coefficient was calculated as .65 for expectation factor (3 items), .64 for knowledge factor (3 items) and .88 for pleasure (expression) factor and .86 for the total scale. Based on the findings from the analyses, it could be concluded that the scale which was developed in order to determine the potential for happiness of individuals is a valid and reliable measurement tool. ; Bu ara\\u015ft\\u0131rman\\u0131n konusunu olu\\u015fturan \\u201cmutluluk potansiyeli\\u201d, mutluluk d\\u00fczeyinin de\\u011fi\\u015fkenli\\u011fine (durumluk mutluluk) odakl\\u0131 olan ve mutluluk yaratma ihtimali ile ilgilenen g\\u00f6r\\u00fc\\u015fe dayan\\u0131r ve ki\\u015finin i\\u00e7inde bulundu\\u011fu durumdan doyum sa\\u011flamas\\u0131n\\u0131, sevin\\u00e7 duymas\\u0131n\\u0131 ifade eder.
