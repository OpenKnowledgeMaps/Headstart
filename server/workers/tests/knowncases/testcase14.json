Ultrasmall hydrated tungsten oxide nanoparticles were prepared by means of hydrothermal treatment of tungstic acid in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone as a template, stabiliser and growth regulator. Tungstic acid was synthesised through an ion-exchange method using sodium tungstate solution and a strongly acidic cation exchange resin. Upon illumination, photochromic nanoparticles of WO3 were shown to increase greatly their toxicity against both bacterial (both gram-positive and gram-negative - P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus) and mammalian cells (primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts); under the same conditions, fungi (C. albicans) were less sensitive to the action of tungsten oxide nanoparticles. UV irradiation of primary mouse fibroblasts in the presence of WO3 nanoparticles demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent toxic effect, the latter leading to a significant decrease in dehydrogenase activity and an increase in the number of dead cells.

We synthesised a new type of photochromic tungsten oxide nanoparticles, analysed their photocatalytic activity and carried out a thorough analysis of their effect on prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Ultrasmall hydrated tungsten oxide nanoparticles were prepared by means of hydrothermal treatment of tungstic acid in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone as a template, stabiliser and growth regulator. Tungstic acid was synthesised through an ion-exchange method using sodium tungstate solution and a strongly acidic cation exchange resin. Upon illumination, photochromic nanoparticles of WO3 were shown to increase greatly their toxicity against both bacterial (both gram-positive and gram-negative - P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus) and mammalian cells (primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts); under the same conditions, fungi (C. albicans) were less sensitive to the action of tungsten oxide nanoparticles. UV irradiation of primary mouse fibroblasts in the presence of WO3 nanoparticles demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent toxic effect, the latter leading to a significant decrease in dehydrogenase activity and an increase in the number of dead cells.

Specifically, the review details the infection prevalence of Opisthorchis felineus (O. felineus) in Western Siberia, Russian Federation. From the primary key words screening, 1591 records were identified from which 32 Russian-language publications were relevant. The lowest O. felineus infection rate of 0.4% was reported in Tatarstan Republic, and the highest reached 83.9% in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug. The infection prevalence was lower in children than in adults and increased with age. O. felineus infection was detected more often in indigenous population than in migrants. Infection intensity in western regions (Permskaya, Bryanskaya Oblast) was low and varied from 15 to 336 eggs per gram stool (epg), while in endemic regions it reached more than 2000 epg. In some settlements the mean intensity infection was 5234 epg. The high rates of intensity were registered in regions with a high prevalence of infection. Based on obtained data, a map of O. felineus infection prevalence in Western Siberia was developed. After mapping the results, the highest prevalence was detected in Tyumenskaya Oblast with over 60%, while the Tomskaya Oblast had the lowest prevalence at fewer than 19.0%. Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomus Okrug, Altaiskii Krai, Novosibirskaya Oblast and Omskaya Oblast had an average level of O. felineus infection of 20-39%.

In this study we reviewed Russian scientific literature (scientific publications, book chapters, monographs) published between 1 January 1979 and 31 August 2015 from two sources: Main database of the Russian Scientific Electronic Library (eLIBRARY, http:\\/\\/elibrary.ru\\/), and the Scientific Medical Library of Siberian State Medical University (http:\\/\\/medlib.tomsk.ru\\/). Specifically, the review details the infection prevalence of Opisthorchis felineus (O. felineus) in Western Siberia, Russian Federation. From the primary key words screening, 1591 records were identified from which 32 Russian-language publications were relevant. The lowest O. felineus infection rate of 0.4% was reported in Tatarstan Republic, and the highest reached 83.9% in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug. The infection prevalence was lower in children than in adults and increased with age. O. felineus infection was detected more often in indigenous population than in migrants. Infection intensity in western regions (Permskaya, Bryanskaya Oblast) was low and varied from 15 to 336 eggs per gram stool (epg), while in endemic regions it reached more than 2000 epg. In some settlements the mean intensity infection was 5234 epg. The high rates of intensity were registered in regions with a high prevalence of infection. Based on obtained data, a map of O. felineus infection prevalence in Western Siberia was developed. After mapping the results, the highest prevalence was detected in Tyumenskaya Oblast with over 60%, while the Tomskaya Oblast had the lowest prevalence at fewer than 19.0%. Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomus Okrug, Altaiskii Krai, Novosibirskaya Oblast and Omskaya Oblast had an average level of O. felineus infection of 20-39%. According to the results of the review, Western Siberia must be considered as highly endemic region for opisthorchiasis in the Russian Federation.

Reflecting the discrepancy between received and predicted outcomes, the reward prediction error (RPE) plays an important role in learning in a dynamic environment. A number of studies suggested that the feedback-related negativity (FRN) component of an event-related potential, known to be associated with unexpected outcomes, encodes RPEs. While FRN was clearly shown to be sensitive to the probability of outcomes, the effect of outcome magnitude on FRN remains to be further clarified. In studies on the neural underpinnings of reward anticipation and outcome evaluation, a monetary incentive delay (MID) task proved to be particularly useful. We investigated whether feedback-locked FRN and cue-locked dN200 responses recorded during an auditory MID task were sensitive to the probability and magnitude of outcomes. The cue-locked dN200 is associated with the update of information about the magnitude of prospective outcomes. Overall, we showed that feedback-locked FRN was modulated by both the magnitude and the probability of outcomes during an auditory version of MID task, whereas no such effect was found for cue-locked dN200. Furthermore, the cue-locked dN200, which is associated with the update of information about the magnitude of prospective outcomes, correlated with the standard feedback-locked FRN, which is associated with a negative RPE. These results further expand our knowledge on the interplay between the processing of predictive cues that forecast future outcomes and the subsequent revision of these predictions during outcome delivery.

Influenza A virus matrix protein M1 plays an essential role in the virus lifecycle, but its functional and structural properties are not entirely defined. Here we employed small-angle X-ray scattering, atomic force microscopy and zeta-potential measurements to characterize the overall structure and association behavior of the full-length M1 at different pH conditions. We demonstrate that the protein consists of a globular N-terminal domain and a flexible C-terminal extension. The globular N-terminal domain of M1 monomers appears preserved in the range of pH from 4.0 to 6.8, while the C-terminal domain remains flexible and the tendency to form multimers changes dramatically. We found that the protein multimerization process is reversible, whereby the binding between M1 molecules starts to break around pH 6. A predicted electrostatic model of M1 self-assembly at different pH revealed a good agreement with zeta-potential measurements, allowing one to assess the role of M1 domains in M1-M1 and M1-lipid interactions. Together with the protein sequence analysis, these results provide insights into the mechanism of M1 scaffold formation and the major role of the flexible and disordered C-terminal domain in this process.

Deletion of Glu139 in \\u03b2-tropomyosin caused by a point mutation in TPM2 gene is associated with cap myopathy characterized by high myofilament Ca2+-sensitivity and muscle weakness. To reveal the mechanism of these disorders at molecular level, mobility and spatial rearrangements of actin, tropomyosin and the myosin heads at different stages of actomyosin cycle in reconstituted single ghost fibres were investigated by polarized fluorescence microscopy. The mutation did not alter tropomyosin's affinity for actin but increased strongly the flexibility of tropomyosin and kept its strands near the inner domain of actin. The ability of troponin to switch actin monomers \\\"on\\\" and \\\"off\\\" at high and low Ca2+, respectively, was increased, and the movement of tropomyosin towards the blocked position at low Ca2+ was inhibited, presumably causing higher Ca2+-sensitivity. The mutation decreased also the amount of the myosin heads which bound strongly to actin at high Ca2+ and increased the number of these heads at relaxation; this may contribute to contractures and muscle weakness.

As one of the most devastating forms of trauma, spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a challenging clinical problem. The secondary processes associated with the primary injury, such as overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation, lead to concomitant compression of the injured spinal cord and neuronal death. Delivery of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), an efficient ROS scavenger, to the site of injury can mitigate SCI-induced oxidative stress and tissue damage. Towards this goal catalytically active nanoformulations of SOD1 (\\\"nanozymes\\\") are developed as a modality for treatment of SCI. Along with the cross-linked polyion complex of SOD1 with polycation poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-polylysine (single-coat (SC) nanozyme), we introduce for the first time the chemically cross-linked multilayer polyion complex in which SOD1 is first incorporated into a polyion complex with polycation, then coated by anionic block copolymer, PEG-polyglutamic acid (double-coat (DC) nanozyme). We developed DC nanozymes with high enzymatic activity and ability to retain and protect SOD1 under physiological conditions. Pharmacokinetic study revealed that DC nanozymes significantly prolonged circulation of active SOD1 in the blood stream compared to free SOD1 or SC nanozymes (half-life was 60 vs 6min). Single intravenous injection of DC nanozymes (5kU of SOD1\\/kg) improved the recovery of locomotor functions in rats with moderate SCI, along with reduction of swelling, concomitant compression of the spinal cord and formation of post-traumatic cysts. Thus, based on the testing in a rodent model the SOD1 DC nanozymes are promising modality for scavenging ROS, decreasing inflammation and edema, and improving recovery after SCI.Copyright \\u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These materials were coupled with conductive polypyrrole (PPy) polymer to create a novel bone scaffold for regenerative medicine. Conductive and non-conductive scaffolds were made by slurry casting method and loaded with a model antibiotic, vancomycin (VCM). Their properties were compared in different experiments in which scaffolds containing PPy showed good mechanical properties, higher protein adsorption and higher percentage of VCM release over a long duration of time compared to non-conductive scaffolds. Osteoblast cells were perfectly immersed into the gelatin matrix and remained viable for 14 days.

We find that the shot noise spectrum can be made consistent with the second-order Butterworth filter, while the electronic noise grows linearly with the second power of the frequency.

The broadening of the time duration of an X-ray pulse is observed owing to its diverging effect. A double-crystal monochromator will be used to select and transport the desired X-rays to the sample.

Tungstic acid was synthesised through an ion-exchange method using sodium tungstate solution and a strongly acidic cation exchange resin. Upon illumination, photochromic nanoparticles of WO3 were shown to increase greatly their toxicity against both bacterial (both gram-positive and gram-negative - P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus) and mammalian cells (primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts); under the same conditions, fungi (C. albicans) were less sensitive to the action of tungsten oxide nanoparticles. UV irradiation of primary mouse fibroblasts in the presence of WO3 nanoparticles demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent toxic effect, the latter leading to a significant decrease in dehydrogenase activity and an increase in the number of dead cells. WO3 nanoparticles were photocatalytically active under both UV light and even diffused daylight filtered through a window glass, leading to indigo carmine organic dye discolouration.

Komsomolets sank in 1989\\u00a0at a depth of 1680\\u00a0m in the Norwegian Sea while carrying two nuclear torpedoes in its armament. Subsequent Soviet and Russian expeditions to Komsomolets have shown that releases from the reactor have occurred and that the submarine has suffered considerable damage to its hulls. Norwegian monitoring detected 134Cs in surface sediments around Komsomolets in 1993 and 1994 and elevated activity concentrations of 137Cs in bottom seawater between 1991 and 1993. Since then and up to 2015, no increased activity concentrations of radionuclides above values typical for the Norwegian Sea have been observed in any environmental sample collected by Norwegian monitoring. In 2013 and 2015, Norwegian monitoring was carried out using an acoustic transponder on the sampling gear that allowed samples to be collected at precise locations, \\u223c20\\u00a0m from the hull of Komsomolets. The observed 238Pu\\/239,240Pu activity ratios and 240Pu\\/239Pu atom ratios in surface sediments sampled close to Komsomolets in 2013 did not indicate any releases of Pu isotopes from reactor or the torpedo warheads. Rather, these values probably reflect the overprinting of global fallout ratios with fluxes of these Pu isotopes from long-range transport of authorised discharges from nuclear reprocessing facilities in Northern Europe. However, due to the depth at which Komsomolets lies, the collection of seawater and sediment samples in the immediate area around the submarine using traditional sampling techniques from surface vessels is not possible, even with the use of acoustic transponders. Further monitoring is required in order to have a clear understanding of the current status of Komsomolets as a potential source of radioactive contamination to the Norwegian marine environment.

Metabolism of xenobiotics (Greek xenos: exogenous substances) plays an essential role in the prediction of biological activity and testing for the subsequent research and development of new drug candidates. Integration of various methods and techniques using different computational and experimental approaches is one of the keys to a successful metabolism prediction. While multiple structure-based and ligand-based approaches to metabolism prediction exist, the most important problem arises at the first stage of metabolism prediction: detection of the sites of metabolism (SOMs).

Cell functionalization with recently developed various nano- and microcarriers for therapeutics has significantly expanded the application of cell therapy and targeted drug delivery for the effective treatment of a number of diseases. The aim of this progress report is to review the most recent advances in cell-based drug vehicles designed as biological transporter platforms for the targeted delivery of different drugs. For the design of cell-based drug vehicles, different pathways of cell functionalization, such as covalent and noncovalent surface modifications, internalization of carriers are considered in greater detail together with approaches for cell visualization in vivo. In addition, several animal models for the study of cell-assisted drug delivery are discussed. Finally, possible future developments and applications of cell-assisted drug vehicles toward targeted transport of drugs to a designated location with no or minimal immune response and toxicity are addressed in light of new pathways in the field of nanomedicine.\\u00a9 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Natural peptides with antimicrobial activity are extremely diverse, and peptide synthesis technologies make it possible to significantly improve their properties for specific tasks. Here, we investigate the biological properties of the natural peptide indolicidin and the indolicidin-derived novel synthetic peptide In-58. In-58 was generated by replacing all tryptophan residues on phenylalanine in D-configuration; the \\u03b1-amino group in the main chain also was modified by unsaturated fatty acid. Compared with indolicidin, In-58 is more bactericidal, more resistant to proteinase K, and less toxic to mammalian cells. Using molecular physics approaches, we characterized the action of In-58 on bacterial cells at the cellular level. Also, we have found that studied peptides damage bacterial membranes. Using the Escherichia coli luminescent biosensor strain MG1655 (pcolD'::lux), we investigated the action of indolicidin and In-58 at the subcellular level. At subinhibitory concentrations, indolicidin and In-58 induced an SOS response. Our data suggest that indolicidin damages the DNA, but bacterial membrane perturbation is its principal mode of action.

The migration of nuclei between plant cells (cytomixis) is a mysterious cellular phenomenon frequently observable in the male meiosis of higher plants. Cytomixis attracts attention because of unknown cellular mechanisms underlying migration of nuclei and its potential evolutionary significance, since the genetic material is transferred between the cells that form pollen. Although cytomixis was discovered over a century ago, the advance in our understanding of this process has been rather insignificant because of methodological difficulties. The data that allowed for a new insight into this phenomenon were obtained by examining the migrating nuclei with electron and confocal laser microscopy, immunostaining, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. As has been shown, the chromatin migrating between cells is surrounded by an undamaged nuclear membrane. Such chromatin does not undergo heterochromatization and contains normal euchromatin markers. The condensation degree of the migrating chromatin corresponds to the current meiotic stage, and normal structures of synaptonemal complex are present in the migrating part of the nucleus. The cells involved in cytomixis lack any detectable morphological and molecular markers of programmed cell death. It has been shown that individual chromosomes and genomes (in the case of allopolyploids) have no predisposition to the migration between cells, i.e., parts of the nucleus are involved in cytomixis in a random manner. However, the fate of migrating chromatin after it has entered the recipient cell is still vague. A huge amount of indirect data suggests that migrating chromatin is incorporated into the nucleus of the recipient cell; nonetheless, the corresponding direct evidences are still absent. No specific markers of cytomictic chromatin have been yet discovered. Thus, the causes and consequences of cytomixis are still disputable. This review briefs the recent data on the relevant issues, describes the classical and modern methodological approaches to analysis of the intercellular migration of nuclei, and discusses the problems in cytomixis research and its prospects.

Specifically, the review details the infection prevalence of Opisthorchis felineus (O. felineus) in Western Siberia, Russian Federation. From the primary key words screening, 1591 records were identified from which 32 Russian-language publications were relevant. The lowest O. felineus infection rate of 0.4% was reported in Tatarstan Republic, and the highest reached 83.9% in the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug. The infection prevalence was lower in children than in adults and increased with age. O. felineus infection was detected more often in indigenous population than in migrants. Infection intensity in western regions (Permskaya, Bryanskaya Oblast) was low and varied from 15 to 336 eggs per gram stool (epg), while in endemic regions it reached more than 2000 epg. In some settlements the mean intensity infection was 5234 epg. The high rates of intensity were registered in regions with a high prevalence of infection. Based on obtained data, a map of O. felineus infection prevalence in Western Siberia was developed. After mapping the results, the highest prevalence was detected in Tyumenskaya Oblast with over 60%, while the Tomskaya Oblast had the lowest prevalence at fewer than 19.0%. Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomus Okrug, Altaiskii Krai, Novosibirskaya Oblast and Omskaya Oblast had an average level of O. felineus infection of 20-39%.

Nearly 200,000 children (198,712) aged between 7 and 17 years from 232 urban and rural schools of Rostov region (Southern Federal District of Russia) participated in the study. School age is a period of intensive growth and physiological and psychological development. Irregularities of personal development are caused by a multitude of factors, such as sex differences, heredity, socio-economic status of a family, standard of living, particular environmental conditions, and lifestyle. It has been established that children from the Southern Federal District of Russia had body mass index values higher than age-appropriate norms for all Russians (Total Russian, Rudnev et al., 2014) and World Health Organization charts. Children from urban settings were taller and heavier than children from rural settings. Sex is one of the most influential factors which play key role in determining specific characteristics of growth and personal development. According to our results, boys and girls both had similar age-related changes in weight and height, but their respective dynamics differed. Girls' height and weight values accelerated at the age 10 to 12 years and plateaued after the age fourteen, whereas in boys height and weight steadily increased with age, showing slight acceleration at the age 12 to 13 years, and reached a plateau by the age of seventeen.Copyright \\u00a9 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

In eukaryotes, heterochromatin replicates late in S phase of the cell cycle and contains specific covalent modifications of histones. SuUR mutation found in Drosophila makes heterochromatin replicate earlier than in wild type and reduces the level of repressive histone modifications. SUUR protein was shown to be associated with moving replication forks, apparently through the interaction with PCNA. The biological process underlying the effects of SUUR on replication and composition of heterochromatin remains unknown.Here we performed a functional dissection of SUUR protein effects on H3K27me3 level. Using hidden Markow model-based algorithm we revealed SuUR-sensitive chromosomal regions that demonstrated unusual characteristics: They do not contain Polycomb and require SUUR function to sustain H3K27me3 level. We tested the role of SUUR protein in the mechanisms that could affect H3K27me3 histone levels in these regions. We found that SUUR does not affect the initial H3K27me3 pattern formation in embryogenesis or Polycomb distribution in the chromosomes. We also ruled out the possible effect of SUUR on histone genes expression and its involvement in DSB repair.Obtained results support the idea that SUUR protein contributes to the heterochromatin maintenance during the chromosome replication.

To study the central pattern generators functioning, previously we identified genes, whose neurospecific knockdowns led to deviations in the courtship song of Drosophila melanogaster males. Reduced expression of the gene CG15630 caused a decrease in the interpulse interval. To investigate the role of CG15630, which we have called here fipi (factor of interpulse interval), in the courtship song production, at first, we have characterized fipi transcripts and protein (FIPI) in the mutant flies carrying P insertion and deletions in this gene and in flies with its RNAi knockdown. FIPI is homologous to the mammalian NCAM2 protein, an important factor of neuronal development in the olfactory system. In this study, we have revealed that local fipi knockdown in the antennal olfactory sensory neurons (OR67d and IR84a), which are responsible for reception of chemosignals modulating courtship behavior, alters the interpulse interval in the opposite directions. Thus, a proper fipi expression seems to be necessary for perception of sexual chemosignals, and the effect of fipi knockdown on IPI value depends on the type of chemoreceptor neurons affected.

The analyses indicated that D. palmatum under NT demonstrates high content of photosynthetic pigments, specific fatty acid (FA) profile with domination of saturated FA (53.3%) and the essential oil with trans-pinocamphone as a main component (37.9%). Phenolic compounds were identified using a combination of high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection and electrospray ionization mass-spectrometric detection (HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS) techniques, as well as free carbohydrates and water soluble polysaccharides.

Perftoran, which has been rebranded as Vidaphor for marketing in North America, is an emulsion of perfluorocarbons in a surfactant and electrolyte mixture. It was developed in Russia as an oxygen-carrying intravenous plasma additive for hemorrhagic anemia and ischemic conditions from various etiologies. It was approved for clinical use in Russia in 1996 and used by the Russian Armed Forces and in civilian medical care. It was also approved in Mexico from 2005 to 2010. It has been reportedly administered to over 35,000 patients with significant evidence of benefit and relatively mild and manageable adverse effects. It may have significant potential for use in hemorrhagic shock if human red blood cells are not available, and for several other applications including treatment of vascular gas embolism, cerebral or spinal trauma, and regional ischemia. It is different from other perfluorocarbon preparations under development in the United States in that it uses a different primary perfluorocarbon (perfluorodecalin) and a surfactant (Proxanol 268) instead of egg-yok phospholipid as the emulsion vehicle. Perftoran has a much smaller particle size resulting in milder adverse effects. It has been safely administered to more patients than any oxygen carrier currently under development.

The \\\"dipyrromethene route\\\" was observed to result in better overall yields. All the dyes were characterized by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry (CVA) studies. The UV-Vis spectra exhibited slight dependence on the thiophene chain length. The thienylthio derivatives fluoresce with modest quantum yields; conversely, no fluorescence has been detected for their dithienylthio counterparts. 8-Phenyl-3,5-di(thien-2-ylthio)-BODIPY was characterized by X-ray crystallography, which showed the layered arrangement of the molecules. The thienyl fragments of different molecules in the same layer form pairs alike H-aggregates, whereas the BODIPYs moieties in the different layers are arranged in a J-aggregate fashion. Solid fluorescence was observed for these crystals with a broad emission from 600 nm to longer than 850 nm.

Intrinsically disordered proteins and proteins with intrinsically disordered regions have been shown to be highly prevalent in disease. Furthermore, disease-causing expansions of the regions containing tandem amino acid repeats often push repetitive proteins towards formation of irreversible aggregates. In fact, in disease-relevant proteins, the increased repeat length often positively correlates with the increased aggregation efficiency and the increased disease severity and penetrance, being negatively correlated with the age of disease onset. The major categories of repeat extensions involved in disease include poly-glutamine and poly-alanine homorepeats, which are often times located in the intrinsically disordered regions, as well as repeats in non-coding regions of genes typically encoding proteins with ordered structures. Repeats in such non-coding regions of genes can be expressed at the mRNA level. Although they can affect the expression levels of encoded proteins, they are not translated as parts of an affected protein and have no effect on its structure. However, in some cases, the repetitive mRNAs can be translated in a non-canonical manner, generating highly repetitive peptides of different length and amino acid composition. The repeat extension-caused aggregation of a repetitive protein may represent a pivotal step for its transformation into a proteotoxic entity that can lead to pathology. The goals of this article are to systematically analyze molecular mechanisms of the proteinopathies caused by the poly-glutamine and poly-alanine homorepeat expansion, as well as by the polypeptides generated as a result of the microsatellite expansions in non-coding gene regions and to examine the related proteins. We also present results of the analysis of the prevalence and functional roles of intrinsic disorder in proteins associated with pathological repeat expansions.

A series of amides of the antifungal antibiotic amphotericin B (AmB) and its conjugates with benzoxaboroles was tested to determine whether they form pores in lipid bilayers and to compare their channel characteristics. The tested derivatives produced pores of larger amplitude and shorter lifetime than those of the parent antibiotic. The pore conductance was related to changes in the partial charge of the hydrogens of the hydroxyl groups in the lactone ring that determined the anion coordination in the channel. Neutralization of one of the polar group charges in the AmB head during chemical modification produced a pronounced effect by diminishing the dwell time of the polyene channel compared to modification of both groups. In this study, compounds that had a modification of one carboxyl or amino group were less effective in initializing phase separation in POPC-membranes compared to derivatives that had modifications of both polar groups as well as the parent antibiotic. The effects were attributed to the restriction of the aggregation process by electrical repulsion between charged derivatives in contrast to neutral compounds. The significant correlation between the ability of derivatives to increase the permeability of model membranes-causing the appearance of single channels in lipid bilayers or inducing calcein leakage from unilamellar vesicles-and the minimal inhibitory concentration indicated that the antifungal effect of the conjugates was due to pore formation in the membranes of target cells.

Gamma irradiation is known to inactivate various pathogens that negatively affect honey bee health. Bee pathogens, such as Deformed wing virus (DWV) and Nosema spp., have a deleterious impact on foraging activities and bee survival, and have been detected in combs. In this study, we assessed the effects of gamma irradiation on the flight activities, pathogen load, and survival of two honey bee stocks that were reared in irradiated and non-irradiated combs. Overall, bee genotype influenced the average number of daily flights, the total number of foraging flights, and total flight duration, in which the Russian honey bees outperformed the Italian honey bees. Exposing combs to gamma irradiation only affected the age at first flight, with worker bees that were reared in non-irradiated combs foraging prematurely compared to those reared in irradiated combs. Precocious foraging may be associated with the higher levels of DWV in bees reared in non-irradiated combs and also with the lower amount of pollen stores in colonies that used non-irradiated combs. These data suggest that gamma irradiation of combs can help minimize the negative impact of DWV in honey bees. Since colonies with irradiated combs stored more pollen than those with non-irradiated combs, crop pollination efficiency may be further improved when mite-resistant stocks are used, since they performed more flights and had longer flight durations. de Guzman, Lilia I;Frake, Amanda M;Simone-Finstrom, Michael Russian honey bees; flight activities; foraging behavior; gamma irradiation; radio frequency identification Insects\"},{\"id\":\"29185804\",\"content\":\"Theory of Morphogenesis.

The study employed principal component analysis to construct an \\\"integrated environmental index\\\" by using three alternative and plausible factors including carbon dioxide emissions, fossil fuel energy consumption, and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. The environmental index is used as an interactive term with the three cost of doing business indicators including business disclosure index, the cost of business start-up procedures, and logistics performance index to form environmental cost of doing business (ECDB) indicators. The results of three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimator show that foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows supported the green business while trade openness deteriorates the environment, which partially validates the \\\"pollution haven hypotheses (PHH)\\\" in a panel of countries. There is no evidence for environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis; however, there is a monotonic decreasing relationship between per capita income and ECDB indicators. The hydro energy supports the sustainable business environment, while biofuel consumption deteriorates the environmental impact on the cost of business start-up procedures. Finally, wind energy subsequently affected the ECDB indicators in a panel of BRICS countries. The overall results conclude that growth factors and energy sources both have a considerable impact on the cost of doing business; therefore, there is a momentous need to formulate sustainable policy vista to magnetize green business across countries.

Mucositis is the limiting toxicity of radio(chemo)therapy of head and neck cancer. Diagnostics, prophylaxis and correction of this condition demand new accurate and objective approaches. Here we report on an in vivo longitudinal monitoring of the oral mucosa dynamics in 25 patients during the course of radiotherapy of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer using multifunctional optical coherence tomography (OCT). A spectral domain OCT system with a specially-designed oral imaging probe was used. Microvasculature visualization was based on temporal speckle variations of the full complex signal evaluated by high-pass filtering of 3D data along the slow scan axis. Angiographic image quantification demonstrated an increase of the vascular density and total length of capillary-like-vessels before visual signs or clinical symptoms of mucositis occur. Especially significant microvascular changes compared to their initial levels occurred when grade two and three mucositis developed. Further, microvascular reaction was seen to be dose-level dependent. OCT monitoring in radiotherapy offers a non-invasive, convenient, label-free quantifiable structural and functional volumetric imaging method suitable for longitudinal human patient studies, furnishing fundamental radiobiological insights and potentially providing useful feedback data to enable adaptive radiotherapy (ART).

In the spatial structure of tyrosine phenol-lyase, the Ser51 residue is located in the active site of the enzyme. The replacement of Ser51 with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis led to a decrease of the kcat\\/Km parameter for reactions with l-tyrosine and 3-fluoro-l-tyrosine by three orders of magnitude, compared to wild type enzyme. For the elimination reactions of S-alkylcysteines, the values of kcat\\/Km decreased by an average of two orders of magnitude. The results of spectral studies of the mutant enzyme gave evidence for a considerable change of the chiral properties of the active site as a result of the replacement. Fast kinetic studies for the complexes of the mutant form with competitive inhibitors allowed us to conclude that the Ser51 residue interacts with the side chain amino group of Lys257 at the stage of C-\\u03b1-proton abstraction. This interaction ensures the correct orientation of the side chain of Lys257 accepting the C-\\u03b1-proton of the external aldimine and stabilizes its ammonium form. Also, it is probable that Ser51 takes part in formation of a chain of hydrogen bonds which is necessary to perform the transfer of the C-\\u03b1-proton to the C-4'-position of the leaving phenol group in the reaction with the natural substrate.Copyright \\u00a9 2017.

The study of the kinetics of aggregation of UV-irradiated proteins has attracted considerable interest, since test systems based on aggregation of proteins denatured by UV radiation can be used for screening of the natural and artificial agents possessing chaperone-like activity (anti-aggregation activity). To provide the proper interpretation of the effects caused by the agents under study, the kinetic mechanism of the aggregation process should be established.

Information on socio-demographic factors and oral health behaviour (regularity of dental visits, frequency of tooth-brushing, using toothpaste with fluoride, and skipping tooth-brushing) was obtained from a structured, self-administered questionnaire. Dental caries experience was based on the decayed (D) missing (M) filled (F) teeth (T) index and the Significant Caries (SiC) index, which were assessed through dental examination. Students with a DMFT index \\u22659 were placed in the SiC group. Negative binomial hurdle and multivariable binary logistic regressions were used for statistical analyses.The prevalence of dental caries (DMFT >0) was 96.0%, overall mean DMFT index was 7.58 (DT: 0.61, MT: 0.12, and FT: 6.84), and the corresponding SiC index was 12.50.

Epidermal growth factor receptor kinase is implicated in cancer development due to either overexpression or activation variants in its functional intracellular kinase domain. Threonine to methionine (Thr 790 Met) is one such variant observed commonly in patients showing resistance to kinase inhibitor drug Erlotinib. Two mechanisms for resistance have been proposed (1) steric hindrance and (2) enhanced binding to ATP. In this study, we employed molecular dynamics simulations and studied both the mechanisms. Extensive simulations and free energy of binding analyses has shown that steric hindrance does not explain appropriately the mechanism for resistance against Erlotinib therapy for this variant. It has been observed that conformational switching from an intermediate intrinsically disordered C-helix conformation is required for completion of the kinase's catalytic cycle. Our study substantiates that T790M variant has greater tendency for early transition to this intrinsically disordered C-helix intermediate state. We propose that enhanced catalytic efficiency in addition to enhanced ATP binding explains mechanism of T790M resistance to drug Erlotinib.

They are based on chemical similarity assessment (ChemProt, SuperPred, SEA, SwissTargetPrediction and TargetHunter) or machine learning methods (ChemProt and PASS). To compare their performance, this study has created two evaluation sets, consisting of (1) 50 well-known repositioned drugs and (2) 12 drugs recently patented for new indications. In the first set, sensitivity values varied from 0.64 (TarPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the initial indications and from 0.64 (TarPred) to 0.98 (PASS Online) for the repurposed indications. In the second set, sensitivity values varied from 0.08 (SuperPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the initial indications and from 0.00 (SuperPred) to 1.00 (PASS Online) for the repurposed indications.

We have studied alterations in the properties of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices of juvenile rats induced by the exposure of animals to different individual stressors usually used in batteries of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a widely used model of depression. Social isolation for 16 h did substantially affect neither the magnitude and nor the development of LTP. The effects of stroboscopic illumination and water deprivation appeared most severe, though opposite: the first stressor had activating effect, whereas the second one inhibited the development of LTP. In addition to the effects of these factors on the LTP magnitude, they also affected the patterns of LTP development. In this study weak tetanization with different probability of maintenance was used, and most of stressors, in spite of the similar LTP magnitude, influenced significantly on the process of consolidation. In hippocampal slices from rats maintained on wet bedding for 16 h, the time course but not magnitude of LTP significantly differed from that observed in the control or socially isolated rats. The weakest effect on LTP was observed in hippocampal slices of the rats exposed to food deprivation. In these animals, only some differences were observed in the development of LTP as compared to socially isolated rats.

A new class III antiarrhythmic drug niferidil (RG-2) has been introduced as a highly effective therapy for cases of persistent atrial fibrillation, but ionic mechanisms of its action are poorly understood. In the present study, the effects of niferidil on action potential (AP) waveform and potassium currents responsible for AP repolarization were investigated in guinea pig atrial myocardium.APs were recorded with sharp glass microelectrodes in multicellular atrial preparations. Whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to measure K+ currents in isolated myocytes.In multicellular atrial preparations, 10-8\\u00a0M niferidil effectively prolonged APs by 15.2\\u00a0\\u00b1\\u00a02.8% at 90% repolarization level. However, even the highest tested concentrations, 10-6\\u00a0M and 10-5\\u00a0M failed to prolong APs more than 32.5% of control duration. The estimated concentration of niferedil for half-maximal AP prolongation was 1.13\\u00a0\\u00d7\\u00a010-8\\u00a0M. Among the potassium currents responsible for AP repolarization phase, I K1 was found to be almost insensitive to niferidil.

The gene therapy has been successful in treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) in several animal models, although it still remains unavailable for clinical practice. Surprisingly, regardless the fact that multiple reports showed motor recovery with gene therapy, little is known about molecular and cellular changes in the post-traumatic spinal cord following viral vector- or cell-mediated gene therapy. In this study we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and changes in spinal cord after treatment with the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), angiogenin (ANG), and neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) applied using both approaches. Therapeutic genes were used for viral vector- and cell-mediated gene therapy in two combinations: (1) VEGF+GDNF+NCAM and (2) VEGF+ANG+NCAM. For direct gene therapy adenoviral vectors based on serotype 5 (Ad5) were injected intrathecally and for cell-mediated gene delivery human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells (UCB-MC) were simultaneously transduced with three Ad5 vectors and injected intrathecally 4 h after the SCI. The efficacy of both treatments was confirmed by improvement in behavioral (BBB) test. Molecular and cellular changes following post-traumatic recovery were evaluated with immunofluorescent staining using antibodies against the functional markers of motorneurons (Hsp27, synaptophysin, PSD95), astrocytes (GFAP, vimentin), oligodendrocytes (Olig2, NG2, Cx47) and microglial cells (Iba1). Our results suggest that both approaches with intrathecal delivery of therapeutic genes may support functional recovery of post-traumatic spinal cord via lowering the stress (down regulation of Hsp25) and enhancing the synaptic plasticity (up regulation of PSD95 and synaptophysin), supporting oligodendrocyte proliferation (up regulation of NG2) and myelination (up regulation of Olig2 and Cx47), modulating astrogliosis by reducing number of astrocytes (down regulation of GFAP and vimetin) and microglial cells (down regulation of Iba1).

Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the world. Macrophages are key innate immune cells that play a significant role in transition from the inflammatory to the regenerative phase during wound healing following MI. The scavenger receptor stabilin-1 is one of the most interesting macrophage biomarkers. This receptor contributes to wound healing, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. We suggested a research protocol using macrophage biomarkers to study the cellular basis of cardiac remodeling and healing in patients with acute MI. The purpose of the research was to translate experimental knowledge regarding macrophage subsets and their biomarkers in post-infarction myocardial regeneration into results observed in clinical settings. The study included 41 patients with fatal MI type 1. All patients were divided into four groups according to the timeline of MI histopathology. In addition to routine histopathological analysis, macrophage infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemistry. We used CD68 as a marker for the cells of the macrophage lineage and stabilin-1 as an M2-like macrophage biomarker. The number of CD68+ and stabilin-1+ macrophages in the infarct area increased and peaked in the regenerative phase and did not decrease in the late stage of MI. In the peri-infarct area, the number of CD68+ macrophages increased in the inflammatory phase, peaked during the reparative phase, and did not decrease in the late phase, while the number of stabilin-1+ macrophages increased in the regenerative phase and remained unchanged. Additionally, in the reparative phase, we observed increase in the number of CD68+ and stabilin-1+ macrophages in the non-infarct area. The research protocol suggested allowed us to translate experimental knowledge regarding macrophage subsets and their biomarkers in post-infarction myocardial regeneration into clinical data. Taken together, these results demonstrated biphasic cardiac macrophage response following acute MI somewhat similar to that in a murine model. The increase in stabilin-1+ macrophage infiltration noticed in the myocardium during the regenerative phase and the strong positive correlation between the number of these cells and timeline of MI histopathology enabled us to propose stabilin-1 as a diagnostic macrophage biomarker in myocardium wound healing in patients with acute MI.Copyright \\u00a9 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Bacterial carbohydrate metabolism is extremely diverse, since carbohydrates serve as a major energy source and are involved in a variety of cellular processes. Bacterial genes belonging to same metabolic pathway are often co-localized in the chromosome, but it is not a strict rule. Gene co-localization in linked to co-evolution and co-regulation. This study focuses on a large-scale analysis of bacterial genomic loci related to the carbohydrate metabolism.We demonstrate that only 53% of 148,000 studied genes from over six hundred bacterial genomes are co-localized in bacterial genomes with other carbohydrate metabolism genes, which points to a significant role of singleton genes. Co-localized genes form cassettes, ranging in size from two to fifteen genes. Two major factors influencing the cassette-forming tendency are gene function and bacterial phylogeny. We have obtained a comprehensive picture of co-localization preferences of genes for nineteen major carbohydrate metabolism functional classes, over two hundred gene orthologous clusters, and thirty bacterial classes, and characterized the cassette variety in size and content among different species, highlighting a significant role of short cassettes. The preference towards co-localization of carbohydrate metabolism genes varies between 40 and 76% for bacterial taxa. Analysis of frequently co-localized genes yielded forty-five significant pairwise links between genes belonging to different functional classes. The number of such links per class range from zero to eight, demonstrating varying preferences of respective genes towards a specific chromosomal neighborhood. Genes from eleven functional classes tend to co-localize with genes from the same class, indicating an important role of clustering of genes with similar functions. At that, in most cases such co-localization does not originate from local duplication events.Overall, we describe a complex web formed by evolutionary relationships of bacterial carbohydrate metabolism genes, manifested as co-localization patterns.This article was reviewed by Daria V.

Ninety minutes after the onset of MCAO, the filament was removed in rats of both groups and MRI control of the infarct volume and hemorrhagic complications performed. High-resolution T1- and T2-weighted imaging performed immediately after filament insertion provided visualization of the filament position, blood flow in brain arteries, and complications related to inappropriate filament insertion. It permitted replacement of wrongly positioned filaments and exclusion of animals with complications from the experiment. MRI-based MCAO guiding provided real-time intra-operational monitoring of crucial parameters determining MCAO suitability for stroke modeling, including better assessment of the operation outcomes in individual animals and significant enhancement of the model success rate.

To review data on the role of ethanol-induced alteration of Zn homeostasis in mediation of adverse effects of alcohol abuse.The scholarly published articles on the association between Zn metabolism and alcohol-associated disorders (liver, brain, lung, gut dysfunction, and fetal alcohol syndrome) have been reviewed.It is demonstrated that alcohol-induced modulation of zinc transporters results in decreased Zn levels in lungs, liver, gut, and brain. Zn deficiency in the gut results in increased gut permeability, ultimately leading to endotoxemia and systemic inflammation. Similarly, Zn deficiency in lung epithelia and alveolar macrophages decreases lung barrier function resulting in respiratory distress syndrome. In turn, increased endotoxemia significantly contributes to proinflammatory state in alcoholic liver disease. Finally, impaired gut and liver functions may play a significant role in alcoholic brain damage, being associated with both increased proinflammatory signaling and accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites. It is also hypothesized that ethanol-induced Zn deficiency may interfere with neurotransmission. Similar changes may take place in the fetus as a result of impaired placental zinc transfer, maternal zinc deficiency, or maternal Zn sequestration, resulting in fetal alcoholic syndrome. Therefore, alcoholic Zn deficiency not only mediates the adverse effects of ethanol exposure, but also provides an additional link between different alcohol-induced disorders.Generally, current findings suggest that assessment of Zn status could be used as a diagnostic marker of metabolic disturbances in alcohol abuse, whereas modulation of Zn metabolism may be a potential tool in the treatment of alcohol-associated disorders.

Permeability of the blood-brain barrier for protein fractions 50-100 kDa (PF50-100) of Cellex Daily preparation labeled with fluorescent tracer FITC and non-conjugated FITC were compared after intranasal administration of the preparations to healthy rats. Fluorimetrical analysis of the serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples showed that Cellex Daily PF50-100-FITC administered intranasally penetrated into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid with maximum accumulation in 2 h after administration and persists in the circulation for 24 h probably due to binding with plasma proteins. The differences in the kinetic profile of PF50-100-FITC and free FITC indirectly suggest that the major part of the preparation is not degraded within 24 h and FITC is probably not cleaved from the protein components of the preparation. In vivo fluorescence analysis showed significant fluorescent signal in the olfactory bulbs in 6 h after intranasal administration; hence, the preparation administered via this route can bypass the blood-brain barrier. Scanning laser confocal microscopy of rat brain sections confirmed penetration of the high-molecular weight protein fraction PF50-100-FITC into CNS structures. The most pronounced accumulation of the labeled drug was observed in the olfactory bulb in 6 and 12 h after administration. In contrast to free FITC administered in the control group, significant accumulation of PF50-100-FITC in the olfactory cortex and frontal cortex neurons with functionally active nuclei was observed in 6, 12 and 24 h after intranasal administration.
