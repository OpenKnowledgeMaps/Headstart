According to the actual size of a heading face of a coal mine, a 3D geometric model with a length of 100 m was established, and the effects of ignition energy and gas explosion equivalent on the gas explosion characteristics of the heading face were analyzed. The results show the following. (1) The mathematical models for numerical simulation of gas explosion can accurately simulate the gas explosion and its propagation process. The time-space step size has a great influence on the simulation results. The grid spacing for numerical simulation of mine gas explosion is determined to be 0.1 m and the time step length is determined to be 0.001 s. (2) The ignition energy has a limited effect on gas explosion characteristics. It only has a certain influence on the gas explosion process, but has little influence on the overpressure of shock wave. The larger the ignition energy is, the faster the explosion reaction speed is, and the maximum overpressure increases slightly. When the ignition energy increases to a certain value, the time of peak shock wave and the maximum overpressure both tend to be stable. The ignition energy has little effect on gas explosion characteristics when an explosion accident occurs underground with a large amount of gas accumulation. (3) The gas explosion equivalent has a great influence on the overpressure of gas explosion shock wave. The higher the explosion equivalent is, the greater the pressure is, and the peak value of the shock wave overpressure increases with the explosion equivalent as a power function. The research results have important guiding significance for the research and development of new technology for prevention and control of gas explosion.\",\"published_in\":\"Shock and Vibration, Vol 2020 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Physics; QC1-999\",\"subject\":\"Physics; \",\"authors\":\"Xue-bo Zhang; Jian-liang Gao; Jing-zhang Ren; Chun-xia Wang\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2020\\/8871865\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a84f1299c0125158cc07680bd7d728baca4de4101509544c98de761104f5103f\",\"relevance\":119,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2020\\/8871865\"},{\"id\":\"d01d3183b6fe0daa55927cd35223ffcb5542fb98224068d8e398af884c41ee0b\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.cetjournal.it\\/index.php\\/cet\\/article\\/view\\/10189; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2283-9216; doi:10.3303\\/CET1977161; 2283-9216; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/af2f7c6794ef49f7b3efac2f0c5ca745\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3303\\/CET1977161; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/af2f7c6794ef49f7b3efac2f0c5ca745\",\"title\":\"A Model Structuring Dust, Mist, Gas\\/Vapour and Hybrid Explosion Behavior: The Chemical-Engineering Model\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Chemical-Engineering model describes how the synergetic combination of chemical and engineering factors determines gas, particulate, and hybrid explosion behavior.

During coal exploitation, coal dust explosion has been one of the most common and serious disasters. Nevertheless, the generated dust can suspend in the air, further leading to a secondary explosion. However, there are limited studies focusing on the propagation characteristics of secondary explosion induced by coal dust. Therefore, this paper aims to detect coal dust explosion in a pipe network and investigate the secondary explosion caused by the first explosion. In specific, this paper numerically analyzed the propagation characteristics of first and secondary explosion of coal dust in aspects of flame temperature, airflow rate and CO mass concentration. The results indicate that the maximum flame temperature of the secondary explosion of coal dust could reach up to 4500 K, which was more intense than the first explosion. After the secondary explosion, the air velocity witnessed a significant increase, compared with the first explosion, but the air velocity at the linear section of the pipe network witnessed the highest because of the air supplement at two sides. Different from the highest CO concentration at the ignition area in the first explosion, the CO concentration in the secondary explosion source area decreased rapidly and the maximum CO concentration appeared in the flame front. Moreover, because of enough oxygen supplement, the explosion reaction was much more sufficient, so that the maximum CO concentration was less than that in the first explosion.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Low-Carbon Technologies ; volume 15, issue 1, page 89-96 ; ISSN 1748-1325\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Song, Baichao; Li, Yucheng\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/ijlct\\/ctz061\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"60c74b47c1b209b4c68ce444da08653d59d487733a2094da1f9c629f029b54bb\",\"relevance\":114,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/ijlct\\/ctz061\"},{\"id\":\"a69c4373795e0a7a23177e86f132f4ee9712d77e140d6b89301d82fd8f1d61e0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1002\\/ese3.652; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2050-0505; 2050-0505; doi:10.1002\\/ese3.652; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/cf145fd782b6480b9f4ea6ba899589cc\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1002\\/ese3.652; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/cf145fd782b6480b9f4ea6ba899589cc\",\"title\":\"Experimental study of low\\u2010concentration gas explosion in large\\u2010scale pipeline\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Low\\u2010concentration gas is one of the most realistic and reliable supplementary or alternative energy sources of conventional natural gas, which has a wide range of applications. However, this gas is flammable and explosive during pipeline transportation and easily causes an explosion. In order to achieve safe transmission, the explosion characteristics and propagation law of low\\u2010concentration gas are systematically studied through a large\\u2010scale pipeline experimental system. We found that the peak pressure of low\\u2010concentration gas explosion in pipeline has a quadratic function relationship with the propagation distance. Moreover, the peak pressure of gas explosion initially decreases from the explosion source, and then a turning point appears after a certain distance of propagation, which is followed by a sharp increase of peak pressure of gas explosion. The explosion pressure becomes maximum at the outlets of a pipeline. The arrival time of explosion flame is logarithmically relevant to propagation distance, while the speed of flame propagation gradually increases along with the increase of propagation distance. The flame propagation is faster at the exit point. In addition, the diameter of pipeline has also an important influence on the explosion propagation process of low\\u2010concentration gas. So, the larger the diameter, the higher the explosion pressure. The explosion pressure of DN700 pipeline is obviously higher than that of DN500, and the explosion pressure rises faster; the speed of flame propagation of gas explosion in DN700 pipeline is also higher than that in DN500 pipeline. This study provides a theoretical reference for the prevention and control of explosion accidents in low\\u2010concentration gas pipelines.\",\"published_in\":\"Energy Science & Engineering, Vol 8, Iss 6, Pp 2129-2140 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"explosion characteristic; flame propagation; large\\u2010scale pipeline; low\\u2010concentration gas; Technology; T; Science; Q\",\"subject\":\"explosion characteristic; flame propagation; large\\u2010scale pipeline; low\\u2010concentration gas; Technology; T; Science; Q\",\"authors\":\"Lei Li; Zhigang Zhang; Peng Liu; Kequan Wang; Jun Zhang; Xuelong Li\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1002\\/ese3.652\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a69c4373795e0a7a23177e86f132f4ee9712d77e140d6b89301d82fd8f1d61e0\",\"relevance\":113,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1002\\/ese3.652\"},{\"id\":\"21229d5778380a982b4823fb5f750a2d49788cdf3eee910d8b3c5cd12d93d3f2\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.degruyter.com\\/view\\/j\\/rput.2019.27.issue-44\\/rput-2019-0007\\/rput-2019-0007.xml?format=INT; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1338-0532; 1338-0532; doi:10.2478\\/rput-2019-0007; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c5b0776bddfd460288396eae94593238\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.2478\\/rput-2019-0007; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c5b0776bddfd460288396eae94593238\",\"title\":\"Study of Explosion Characteristics of the Wheat Flour Dust Clouds in Dependence of the Particle Size Distribution\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Fire protection is an important part of the industry where flammable and explosive dusts are found.

In the presence of a sufficient amount of oxygen and an ignition source, such a situation could lead to explosion that may result in the destruction of building structures and the building in general. Strengthening the stability of supporting structures is aimed at protecting industrial premises against possible destruction by explosion indoors. One of the effective ways to protect construction structures against the excessive pressure of explosion is to use explosion venting panels. In order to solve practical tasks on protecting industrial premises and structures against explosion, one must be able to choose both the area and parameters for explosion venting panels. In addition, in order to reduce the related loads to safe quantities, it is necessary to properly calculate the bearing structures in terms of dynamic stability while maintaining their carrying capacity. The set task to ensure protection against explosion by applying explosion venting panels with flexible elements can be solved through integrated accounting for mechanical properties of cellular polycarbonate sheets. We have performed experimental research into performance of the inertia-free explosion venting panels with flexible enclosing elements exposed to dynamic loads under conditions of explosion. Based on the obtained results, the effective rigidity and critical displacement of cellular polycarbonate sheets of flexible elements have been determined. It has been established that for cellular polycarbonate sheets with a thickness of 4\\u20128 mm effective rigidity ranges within 301\\u2013215 N\\u00b7m; the critical displacement of edges in this case is 2.9\\u20139.8 mm.

In this study, a 20 L explosion sphere vessel was used to investigate the effect of sulfur content, particle size, and concentration on the explosion pressure and minimum explosible concentration of metal sulfide ore dust clouds. Four samples with different sulfur contents were selected (30%\\u201340%, 20%\\u201330%, 10%\\u201320%, and 0%\\u201310%). Before and after the explosion, samples were tested by X-ray diffraction. The results indicate that the metal sulfide ore dust is explosive dust with St1 grade explosion pressure. With an increase in concentration, the maximum explosion pressure increased at first and then decreased. With an increase in sulfide content, the explosion pressure of metal sulfide ore dust increased, while the minimum explosible concentration decreased. As particle size decreased, the MEC also decreased. The sulfur content, particle size, and concentration of metal sulfide ore dust were the main factors affecting the explosion hazard.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Chemistry, Vol 2020 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Chemistry; QD1-999\",\"subject\":\"Chemistry; \",\"authors\":\"Yun-zhang Rao; Chang-shun Tian; Wei Xu; Chun-yu Xiao; Bo-yun Yuan; Yao Yu\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2020\\/7980403\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"e9bf22b32e6b4df8493ef39e6159e6903dbcbab03cab6be538866b09c57641d1\",\"relevance\":100,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2020\\/7980403\"},{\"id\":\"3f43c2343a821f55be209d80819f0e19fdbfc5fa8da2ff59d44c0a6f5cf4a301\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11937\\/76332; doi:10.1016\\/j.psep.2019.05.019\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11937\\/76332; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.psep.2019.05.019\",\"title\":\"Numerical and analytical prediction of pressure and impulse from vented gas explosion in large cylindrical tanks\",\"paper_abstract\":\"\\u00a9 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers This paper presents an extension of previous study on estimating the internal and external pressure and impulse from vented gas explosion in large cylindrical tanks.

In this method, only the explosion energy and distance from the centre of explosion are required to find the damage by using simple predictive models in terms of empirical-type formulas. The explosion model herein is a TNO multiphysic method. This provides the maximum overpressure and pulse duration in terms of the explosion length and distance from explosion centre. Thereafter, the obtained results are combined with the SDOF model of the blast wall to determine the ductility ratio and the damage. By using advanced optimisation techniques, two types of predictive models are found. In the first model, the formula is found in terms of 2 parameters of explosion length and distance from explosion centre. However, the 2nd model has 3 parameters of explosion length, distance, and also the natural period of the blast wall. These predictive models are then used to find explosion damages and ductility ratio. The results are compared with FEM analysis and pressure-impulse (P-I) method. It is shown that both types of models fit well with the outputs of the simulation. Moreover, results of both models are close to FEM analysis. The comparison tables provided in this paper show that, in the asymptotic region of P-I diagrams, results are not accurate. Therefore, this new method is superior to classical pressure-impulse (P-I) diagrams in the literature. Advantage of the new method is the easy damage assessment by using simple empirical-type formulas. Therefore, the researchers can use the method in this paper, for damage assessment in other types of blast resistive structures.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Majid Aleyaasin\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/5129274\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f4f87e9aa4978dbd5cc532dd66b4d031451b8554f048742770685466c4a955d9\",\"relevance\":98,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/5129274\"},{\"id\":\"851e34ef88e1daf01f389c38ed7ff4ca5adaef5fcf2e1767b073f6527c1b4ea0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.cetjournal.it\\/index.php\\/cet\\/article\\/view\\/10050; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2283-9216; doi:10.3303\\/CET1977022; 2283-9216; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9b9aaf585c384d8681e5e57af9e45b12\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3303\\/CET1977022; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9b9aaf585c384d8681e5e57af9e45b12\",\"title\":\"The influence of strong ignition sources on the explosion and decomposition limits of gases\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Explosion and decomposition limits of flammable and chemically unstable gases were determined experimentally in a closed autoclave with an ignition energy higher than the standard 10 J a 20 J.

The steel\\u2013concrete composite bridge is widely used in expressways and urban viaducts. Explosives are distributed in multiple locations above the deck to avoid stress concentration. The explosion damage analysis is carried out with the equivalent trinitrotoluene of 50 kg, which represents a car explosion in the state of full oil tank. The multi-Euler domain method based on the fully coupled Lagrange and Euler models is adopted for the structural analysis of the explosion process with the commercial software Autodyn. This study shows that the structural failure goes through three stages: elastoplastic, plastic, and plastic hinge with full section. From 1\\/8 to 1\\/2 of the bridge span, the failure times of the bridge are 277, 164, 133, and 133 ms, matching the displacements of 412, 889, 819, and 819 mm, respectively, while the explosion occurs above steel beams. For the explosion occurring above the concrete deck, the failure times are 335, 154, 121, and 125 ms, corresponding to the deflections of 479, 930, 722, and 752 mm. When the explosion occurs from bearings to the quarter of the bridge span, shear failure of steel beams occurs before bending failure, and both of them control the explosion-resistant design of structures.

The rapid pressure developed during a dust explosion can be mitigated by venting. The present work explored the effects of venting on the explosion of different mixing weight ratios of aluminium and silver powder mixtures. The explosion characteristics of aluminium-silver mixtures were assessed in a 0.0012 m3 confined and vented cylindrical vessel. It was found that the application of 0.1 bar static burst pressure (Pstat) venting membrane gives one tenth reduction on explosion pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise for 70:30 and 50:50 mixing weight ratios of aluminium-silver mixtures explosion, respectively. This finding suggests that besides the venting application effect, the oxidation reaction of aluminium could be disrupted due to the presence of silver powder in the metal mixtures which results in lower heat transfer and reduction of the mass burning rate, hence, lessen flame speeds and explosion severity. However, the venting effectiveness is reduced when the Pstat increases. In order to assess the applicability of the dust explosion venting standard; NFPA 68 and EN 14491, the experimental results were compared with the calculated values according to the standards. The comparative results show that, both NFPA 68 and EN 14491 give underestimated values for explosion venting as compared with the experimental results.\",\"published_in\":\"ASEAN Journal of Chemical Engineering; Vol 20, No 1 (2020); 11-19 ; 2655-5409 ; 1655-4418\",\"year\":\"2020-06-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"Explosion characteristics; Nanoaluminium; Nanosilver; Static burst pressure; Venting\",\"subject\":\"Explosion characteristics; Nanoaluminium; Nanosilver; Static burst pressure; Venting\",\"authors\":\"Mohd Mokhtar, Khairiah; Che Hassan, Che Rosmani; Md Kasmani, Rafiziana; Hamid, Mahar Diana; Mohamad Nor, Mohamad Iskandr; Mohd Junaidi, Mohd Usman\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/jurnal.ugm.ac.id\\/AJChE\\/article\\/view\\/51850\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a7803886247b3590f0d7c9b1f72fb5d71eb80cd4df4c0ecacb86bad402fc1970\",\"relevance\":93,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"0c6ce3ea25aace43768d03f7a435913acf47c6a92116ba272236973e0a6674a1\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/transactions-ksrc.ru\\/eng\\/archive\\/Effect-of-close-proximity-underwater-explosion-upon-elements-of-hull-structures-\\/; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2542-2324; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2618-8244; 2542-2324; 2618-8244; doi:10.24937\\/2542-2324-2019-1-387-73-92; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a1966ebed9034b16a9a46b0785903b2e\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24937\\/2542-2324-2019-1-387-73-92; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/a1966ebed9034b16a9a46b0785903b2e\",\"title\":\"Effect of close proximity underwater explosion upon elements of hull structures\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Object and purpose of research.

[Methods] The dynamic response of the 45 # clamped air-back steel plate with diameter of 600 mm and thickness of 5 mm subjected to multiple underwater explosion loading was studied by a method of combining experiment and numerical simulation. The plastic deformation history of the steel plate was obtained and the basic law of plastic deformation was analyzed. [Results] The results show that the morphology produced by plastic deformation of the 45 # clamped air-back steel plate subjected to multiple underwater explosion loading is spherical-like,and the deformation mode is mainly bending deformation and biaxial tensile deformation. When the amount of explosive and the explosion distance are fixed,the deflection increment of the center of the steel plate will be decreased gradually as the number of underwater explosion loading increased,and after the second explosion loading,the deflection increment will be third-order of the first explosion loading. When the total amount of explosive is constant,compared with the results of multiple uniform underwater explosion loading,both the deflection and thickness reduction rate of the steel plate after single underwater explosion loading are larger,and the maximum difference of the center deflection is 20.25%. [Conclusions] The experimental results agree well with the simulation results,which can provide certain reference for ship protection design.\",\"published_in\":\"Zhongguo Jianchuan Yanjiu, Vol 14, Iss 6, Pp 122-129 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"underwater explosion; clamped steel plate; plastic deformation; numerical simulation; Naval architecture.

The vertical well had a diameter of 0.7 m and different depths (2 m, 4 m, and 6 m), and the horizontal well had a diameter of 0.8 m and a length of 20 m at both sides. The effects of different ignition positions, well depths, and gas compositions and concentrations on the explosion characteristics and rules governing the propagation of flammable gases in a municipal sewage pipeline were investigated. The findings suggest that different ignition positions (at the top, middle, and bottom of the inspection well) did not lead to a significant difference between peak explosion pressure and temperatures but had a substantial influence on the propagation velocity of the explosion flame near the corner of the junction between the vertical inspection well and the horizontal well. Different inspection well depths had no significant impact on the peak explosion pressure or temperature but had a substantial effect on the propagation velocity of the explosion flame at the bottom of the well. Compared with a methane (CH4) explosion at a concentration of 6%, the peak explosion pressure, peak explosion temperature, and flame propagation velocity of a CH4 and oil-gas mixture at a concentration ratio of 6% : 1% were found to be significantly higher. With increasing oil-gas concentrations (2%, 4%, and 6%), the peak pressure, temperature, and flame propagation velocity continued to decrease. The findings of this study can help prevent explosion accidents in municipal sewage pipelines and provide a reference to support the establishment of related standards.\",\"published_in\":\"Advances in Civil Engineering, Vol 2020 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Engineering (General).

The explosion characteristics and flame propagation behavior of oil shale dust are worth studying. The difference between the multiple explosion behaviors of oil shale dust was investigated with the use of a 20 L explosive spherical tank and a dust MIE experimental device. The explosion characteristics and microstructure changes of the explosive products in multiple explosions were examined. The experimental results show that the maximum explosion pressure (Pmax) dropped, and simultaneously, the minimum ignition energy (MIE), the explosion time (t), and the maximum rate of pressure rise (dp\\/dtmax) increased as the explosions continued. Furthermore, the oil shale continued exploding until the third explosion. Some original oil shale dust (OOSD) and explosive residues were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. The SEM images of the explosive residues indicate a high fragmentation degree and well-developed pore structure during the entire multiexplosion process. Oxygen-containing functional groups, the aliphatic C-H bond, and the aromatic C-H bond in oil shale dust all participated in the oil shale dust explosion process.\",\"published_in\":\"Shock and Vibration, Vol 2019 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Physics; QC1-999\",\"subject\":\"Physics; \",\"authors\":\"Bo Liu; Yansong Zhang; Yuyuan Zhang; Jinshe Chen; Xiangbao Meng\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/8679724\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8479ac8b10c6409a900bdcec460a95540feb153b538ed2c292a39360aa736364\",\"relevance\":89,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/8679724\"},{\"id\":\"eb18f40adb7bccb8b5bcb9a9cb7983d1cdd4140fb2f01b3445df51a1daec48d7\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S1738573318302961; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1738-5733; 1738-5733; doi:10.1016\\/j.net.2018.08.019; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c525a4abf6424fd4974bb2f0ade9b436\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.net.2018.08.019; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c525a4abf6424fd4974bb2f0ade9b436\",\"title\":\"Stratified steam explosion energetics\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Vapor explosions can be classified in terms of modes of contact between the hot molten fuel and the coolant, since different contact modes may affect fuel-coolant mixing and subsequent vapor explosion energetics. It is generally accepted that most vapor explosion phenomena fall into three different modes of contact; fuel pouring into coolant, coolant injection into fuel and stratified fuel-coolant layers. In this study, we review previous stratified steam explosion experiments as well as recent experiments performed at the KTH in Sweden. While experiments with prototypic reactor materials are minimal, we do note that generally the energetics is limited for the stratified mode of contact. When the fuel mass involved in a steam explosion in a stratified geometry is compared to a pool geometry based on geometrical aspects, one can conclude that there is a very limited set of conditions (when melt jet diameter is small) under which a steam explosion is more energetic in a stratified geometry. However, under these limited conditions the absolute energetic explosion output would still be small because the total fuel mass involved would be limited.

The ability to predict the reduced explosion pressure for a given vent area is crucial in the design of venting devices. In preceding publications by BASF, a model to predict the reduced explosion pressure was introduced. The model describes the pressure development inside the vessel using a zero-dimensional approach for the explosion. The mass reduction due to the vented gases is calculated from the Efflux function. To improve the accordance of the predicted explosion pressures with experimental data, the existing model is refined in the present work by applying a one-dimensional model to represent the flame propagation along the vessela centreline. This increases the accuracy of the predicted reduced explosion pressures compared to the previous version, especially for large vent areas. The explosion is described by an iterative routine for the combustion process and the induced flow velocities and turbulence. The integration of the effect of increased turbulence due to the flow of vented gases on the burning velocity was found to be crucial.\",\"published_in\":\"Chemical Engineering Transactions, Vol 77 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Chemical engineering; TP155-156; Computer engineering.

A Difference-inDifferences approach was then applied based on the transaction records. The results indicated that the impact of the negative \\\"hazard effect\\\" on the average total price of property was not significantly higher than the positive \\\"renew effect\\\" in the nine months after the gas explosion. The net effect of the \\\"renew effect\\\" was more likely to increase the price as the gas explosion time passes. Moreover, the quantile analysis suggested that the high-priced properties significantly benefited from the \\\"renew effect\\\" after three months of gas explosion, while the positive effect on properties with low total price was significantly after nine months of the explosion. Overall, the total increase of the house price due to the net \\\"renew effect\\\" in the gas explosion area was higher than the total cost of the reconstruction and renovation contributed by the public and private sectors.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u9ad8\\u96c4\\u6c23\\u7206;\\u5be6\\u50f9\\u767b\\u9304;\\u5730\\u7406\\u8cc7\\u8a0a\\u7cfb\\u7d71;\\u5dee\\u7570\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5dee\\u7570\\u6cd5; Kaohsiung Gas Explosions; Real Estate Transaction; Geographic Information System; Difference-in-Differences\",\"subject\":\"\\u9ad8\\u96c4\\u6c23\\u7206;\\u5be6\\u50f9\\u767b\\u9304;\\u5730\\u7406\\u8cc7\\u8a0a\\u7cfb\\u7d71;\\u5dee\\u7570\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5dee\\u7570\\u6cd5; Kaohsiung Gas Explosions; Real Estate Transaction; Geographic Information System; Difference-in-Differences\",\"authors\":\"\\u6797\\u58eb\\u6df5; Lin , Shih-Yuan; \\u5f90\\u58eb\\u52db; Hsu, Shih-Hsun; \\u9673\\u742e\\u4ec1; Chen, Tsung-Jen\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw\\/\\/handle\\/140.119\\/127575\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"b5a6252bd63e7fbea49f11de839819cc3d93e9711cc39733e62f747c04298d21\",\"relevance\":85,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"a57779efde37d3c688b03f616f1f2681277233a2fb7991dd2886955cb971a77d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fmicb.2020.02027\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1664-302X; 1664-302X; doi:10.3389\\/fmicb.2020.02027; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/bfa62f483bdb407483f32cc1d54f8b4d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fmicb.2020.02027; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/bfa62f483bdb407483f32cc1d54f8b4d\",\"title\":\"Steam Explosion Pretreatment Changes Ruminal Fermentation in vitro of Corn Stover by Shifting Archaeal and Bacterial Community Structure\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Steam explosion is an environment-friendly pretreatment method to improve the subsequent hydrolysis process of lignocellulosic biomass. Steam explosion pretreatment improved ruminal fermentation and changed fermentation pattern of corn stover during ruminal fermentation in vitro. The study gave a comprehensive insight into how stream explosion pretreatment shifted archaeal and bacterial community structure to change ruminal fermentation in vitro of corn stover. Results showed that steam explosion pretreatment dramatically improved the apparent disappearance of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF). Steam explosion pretreatment significantly increased the molar proportion of propionate and decreased the ratio of acetate to propionate. At archaeal level, steam explosion pretreatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter, which can effectively remove metabolic hydrogen to keep the fermentation continuing. At bacterial level, the shift in fermentation was achieved by increasing the relative abundance of cellulolytic bacteria and propionate-related bacteria, including Spirochaetes, Elusimicrobia, Fibrobacteres, Prevotella, Treponema, Ruminococcus, and Fibrobacter.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Microbiology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"steam explosion; corn stover; ruminal fermentation in vitro; archaeal community; bacterial community; Microbiology; QR1-502\",\"subject\":\"steam explosion; corn stover; ruminal fermentation in vitro; archaeal community; bacterial community; Microbiology; \",\"authors\":\"Kun Wang; Xuemei Nan; Jinjin Tong; Guangyong Zhao; Linshu Jiang; Benhai Xiong\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fmicb.2020.02027\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a57779efde37d3c688b03f616f1f2681277233a2fb7991dd2886955cb971a77d\",\"relevance\":84,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fmicb.2020.02027\"},{\"id\":\"1a0a3f3caa1e32233563ed82f09e817107967b9ed3006e373163cb2bcc954893\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.cetjournal.it\\/index.php\\/cet\\/article\\/view\\/10108; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2283-9216; doi:10.3303\\/CET1977080; 2283-9216; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/725acd93d6024a07a70b0fe15dc9b1ab\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3303\\/CET1977080; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/725acd93d6024a07a70b0fe15dc9b1ab\",\"title\":\"The Influence of Sieving on the Dust Explosion Characteristics of a Lignite Coal\",\"paper_abstract\":\"For the new developments in the area of coal-fired power plants, the flexibility is a major concern. The power plants must be able to operate with a high variety of coal qualities, with different particle size distribution, moisture content and ash content. In order to research the combustibility of different sieved fractions of lignite coal in solid fuel power plants, the explosion characteristics were investigated experimentally. The aim of this study is to determine the ignition characteristics of a dried brown coal. Different sieved fractions are researched in order to investigate the influence of particle size distribution on the ignition sensitivity and explosion severity of the coal. Different explosion characteristics are determined using standardised test apparatuses, such as the MIKE-3 apparatuses and the 20-L sphere. Following characteristics are determined: minimum ignition energy (MIE), maximum explosion pressure (Pmax), maximum rate of explosion pressure rise (dP\\/dt)max and the dust explosion constant (Kst). The behaviour of the explosion characteristics are related with the particle size distribution of the sieved fractions.\",\"published_in\":\"Chemical Engineering Transactions, Vol 77 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Chemical engineering; TP155-156; Computer engineering.

[Methods] First,the reliability of the simulation method was verified by experimental data. Then the simulation model of the explosion venting cabin was established using the finite element analysis software. And the principle of thin-plate explosion venting structure was analyzed;the damage failure and load variation under different thin plate thicknesses were studied. Finally,the quadratic function model of specific impulse and deflection changing with the thickness is obtained by function fitting. [Results] The results show that the failure of the cabin first occurred at the connection between the thin plate and bulkhead,and gradually extended to the corners and edges of bulkhead;the thinner the plate,the likely an explosion venting opening is to form. When an explosion venting opening forms,the whole thin plate flies out of the cabin;the existence of the explosion venting structure has little effect on the initial shock wave overpressure,but it can effectively reduce the quasi-static pressure and specific impulse in the cabin. The main factors causing the deformation of the protective bulkhead are the initial shock wave and the reflected shock wave,and the main factor causing the ultimate damage of the protective bulkhead is the quasi-static pressure acting for a long time.

Steam explosion had a tendency to improve the concentration of total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) ( P = 0.082). In conclusion, steam explosion of OPF and EFB reduced NDF, ADF, and hemicellulose content and increased gas production and TVFA concentration.\",\"published_in\":\"Tropical Animal Health and Production ; volume 52, issue 3, page 1223-1228 ; ISSN 0049-4747 1573-7438\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Food Animals; Animal Science and Zoology\",\"subject\":\"Food Animals; Animal Science and Zoology\",\"authors\":\"Wu, Hao; Zhou, Zhenming; Yang, Yuanlong; Meng, Qingxiang\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s11250-019-02117-4\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"14052ce8456a5007436293bc5b8cd3ec43570a6b07d2de3b606b68b178127d86\",\"relevance\":73,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s11250-019-02117-4\"},{\"id\":\"c30cb4009d7f8ca762d67d77d2806da8563ac223b25db482c985c950b9468209\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2478\\/acs-2019-0026; https:\\/\\/content.sciendo.com\\/view\\/journals\\/acs\\/12\\/2\\/article-p185.xml\",\"title\":\"Steam explosion of wood particles from fibreboard and particle board with indirect control by enzymatic hydrolysis\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Pretreatment of particles obtained from lignocellulosic materials by steam explosion with indirect control by enzymatic hydrolysis has been studied. The dendromass pretreatment model has been applied for recycled fibreboard and particle board based on softwood. Their structure and chemical composition partly predetermine these lignocellulosic materials consisting of a mixture of spruce and fir particles also for bioethanol production. Optimum steam explosion temperature of 205 \\u00b0C was determined based on the concentration of total monosaccharides \\u2014 glucose, xylose and arabinose, among all experimentally prepared hydrolysates. This corresponds to basic conditions for fine disintegration of biomass to lignocellulosic structure with good holocellulose accessibility. Particles obtained from fibreboard and particle board primarily consisting of softwood without steam explosion pretreatment provide relatively low cellulose accessibility for commercial enzymes activity while monosaccharides concentration is partly reduced because of torrefaction at high temperatures. The concentration of monosaccharides in hydrolysates was determined for original sample and each steam explosion temperature. Based on the steam explosion conditions, the effect of severity factors was investigated to find optimum pretreatment conditions to increase accessibility of softwood cellulose and hemicelluloses. The identified optimum severity factor R O = 4.09 matches the optimum steam explosion temperature of 205 \\u00b0C and the residence time of 10 minutes.\",\"published_in\":\"Acta Chimica Slovaca ; volume 12, issue 2, page 185-191 ; ISSN 1339-3065\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Pa\\u017eitn\\u00fd, Andrej\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2478\\/acs-2019-0026\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c30cb4009d7f8ca762d67d77d2806da8563ac223b25db482c985c950b9468209\",\"relevance\":72,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2478\\/acs-2019-0026\"},{\"id\":\"5f1dd41fcb7e5eb699168c4071f17d6d3abeb2ff9f4a666bec9a68ce158661b6\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.degruyter.com\\/view\\/j\\/lpts.2019.56.issue-3\\/lpts-2019-0018\\/lpts-2019-0018.xml?format=INT; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0868-8257; 0868-8257; doi:10.2478\\/lpts-2019-0018; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/8e2361f348cd486693c7d5b1a37fb6e3\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.2478\\/lpts-2019-0018; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/8e2361f348cd486693c7d5b1a37fb6e3\",\"title\":\"Impact Modelling of Explosion of Mixture Explosive Charges on the Environment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The present paper provides the modelling of the explosion of the charges of the traditional (trotyl) and new blended explosive substances: polymix GR1\\/8 (74 %) + KRUK2 (26 %), compolite GS6, polymix GR4-T10.

We propose twelve nodes to represent accident evolution and establish a Bayesian network model for chemical plant explosion accidents, combining historical data with expert experience to support the prevention, management, and real-time warning. Hypothetical scenarios and catastrophic explosion scenarios were analyzed by setting different combinations of states for nodes. Moreover, the impacts of factors such as factory type, material form, accident equipment, the emergency response on casualty and property loss are evaluated. We find that sensitivity of property loss and casualties to factory type and ongoing work are less significant; the equipment factors result in more casualties than that from personnel factors; the impact of emergency response on the accident results is significant; equipment safety management and personnel safety training are the most important measures to prevent chemical plant explosion risks.\",\"published_in\":\"Sustainability, Vol 12, Iss 1, p 137 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"risk analysis; chemical plant explosion; bayesian network; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350\",\"subject\":\"risk analysis; chemical plant explosion; bayesian network; Environmental effects of industries and plants;  Renewable energy sources;  Environmental sciences; \",\"authors\":\"Rongchen Zhu; Xin Li; Xiaofeng Hu; Deshui Hu\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su12010137\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"fe970791d486707605fa8fe0f1f2fc9c3d160173f6b41f483b61d1f5eea443f8\",\"relevance\":68,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su12010137\"},{\"id\":\"b06b2761ac7fddb1addde823c7a615309967cb57f9f882118df99805da859b39\",\"relation\":\"Energies; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/en12081574\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10084\\/135209; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/en12081574\",\"title\":\"Explosion characteristics of propanol isomer-air mixtures\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper describes a series of experiments performed to study the explosion characteristics of propanol isomer (1-propanol and 2-propanol)-air binary mixtures.

By using the difference-in-differences method and the sample from the property agent, we found that the explosion event generated a long-time effect on the public and property market in the city of Tianjin. Relative to those properties far away from the explosion site, the sales price and the sale-to-list ratio of the property near the explosion site were detected to have significant drops for the first six months after the explosion event. The temporal decrease of the relative sales price and the sale-to-list ratio are the evidence of short period overreaction from the public, which decays over time. This study demonstrates an indirect method to estimate the perceived risk of the general public and provides valuable insight into sustainable port management policies.\",\"published_in\":\"Sustainability, Vol 12, Iss 3, p 1169 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"tianjin port explosion; risk perception; property value; difference-in-differences; the housing market; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350\",\"subject\":\"tianjin port explosion; risk perception; property value; difference-in-differences; the housing market; Environmental effects of industries and plants;  Renewable energy sources;  Environmental sciences; \",\"authors\":\"Yaoxuan Huang; Tsz Leung Yip; Cong Liang\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su12031169\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"864b0ca41bca639de5bdfc9c07d5bde0eb2d0adb1f1235233f7d85f16c3c03dd\",\"relevance\":63,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su12031169\"},{\"id\":\"7dab3c80a238db0ab1a613aaea00a56a1472573d1f753fa0aa72b12764911a4d\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/2763907; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1070-9622; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1875-9203; 1070-9622; 1875-9203; doi:10.1155\\/2019\\/2763907; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/cbcb2103af8b44b7865c40c36b3c74a3\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/2763907; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/cbcb2103af8b44b7865c40c36b3c74a3\",\"title\":\"Experimental Study on the Ignition Sensitivity and Explosion Severity of Different Ranks of Coal Dust\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study is conducted to examine the ignition sensitivity and explosion severity differences among different ranks of coal dust and reveal the causes underlying these differences.

In the presence of a sufficient amount of oxygen and an ignition source, such a situation could lead to explosion that may result in the destruction of building structures and the building in general. Strengthening the stability of supporting structures is aimed at protecting industrial premises against possible destruction by explosion indoors. One of the effective ways to protect construction structures against the excessive pressure of explosion is to use explosion venting panels. In order to solve practical tasks on protecting industrial premises and structures against explosion, one must be able to choose both the area and parameters for explosion venting panels. In addition, in order to reduce the related loads to safe quantities, it is necessary to properly calculate the bearing structures in terms of dynamic stability while maintaining their carrying capacity. The set task to ensure protection against explosion by applying explosion venting panels with flexible elements can be solved through integrated accounting for mechanical properties of cellular polycarbonate sheets. We have performed experimental research into performance of the inertia-free explosion venting panels with flexible enclosing elements exposed to dynamic loads under conditions of explosion. Based on the obtained results, the effective rigidity and critical displacement of cellular polycarbonate sheets of flexible elements have been determined. It has been established that for cellular polycarbonate sheets with a thickness of 4\\u20128 mm effective rigidity ranges within 301\\u2013215 N\\u00b7m; the critical displacement of edges in this case is 2.9\\u20139.8 mm.

The peculiarity of the considered oscillatory process is that as a result of the interaction of well charges with each other, the mass of a separate charge will be expressed by the effective mass, and the seismicity coefficient is a constant value for given conditions of mass explosions. The latter circumstance allows to confidently predict the seismic effect of a career explosion. For example, on the same horizon or in similar mining and geological conditions with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes. The coefficients Kc and n are interconnected by a functional dependence, which is determined on the basis of experimental studies, and later allows you to easily move from one coefficient to the values of another. All parameters included in the dependence to determine the intensity of ground oscillations in the explosion of a dispersed charge fit into the law of similarity of M.A. Sadovskyi with the explosion of chemical explosives. Using the result of experimental studies of the seismic action of short-delayed mass explosions in quarries, a technique has been developed to determine the actual number of simultaneously exploded well charges that are not provided for in the passport of a mass explosion. At the same time, in parallel with the mass explosion, the method provides for the explosion of a single borehole charge before or after the first one.

GC, UPLC, and HPLC techniques were employed to analyze the quality characteristics of the rapeseed oil, including the canolol content and other quality characteristics. Additionally, the effect of steam explosion pretreatment technology on the canolol content of rapeseed oil was studied and the formation mechanism of canolol elucidated. The results revealed that when the steam explosion pressure reached 1.0 MPa, the canolol content of the tested oil increased from 41.21 to 2,168.69 mg\\/kg (52.63\\u2010fold increase) and that sinapic acid played a significant role in the conversion of canolol. Thus, the sinapine was converted into the intermediate (sinapic acid) by hydrolysis, which in turn was transformed into canolol through decarboxylation. The instantaneous high\\u2010energy environment generated by steam explosion pretreatment could intensify the hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions of sinapine and sinapinic acid, thereby significantly increasing the canolol content of the oil. To prove the superiority of steam explosion pretreatment, we compared it with other pretreatment technologies, including traditional high\\u2010temperature roasting and popular microwave pretreatment.

In this method, only the explosion energy and distance from the centre of explosion are required to find the damage by using simple predictive models in terms of empirical-type formulas. The explosion model herein is a TNO multiphysic method. This provides the maximum overpressure and pulse duration in terms of the explosion length and distance from explosion centre. Thereafter, the obtained results are combined with the SDOF model of the blast wall to determine the ductility ratio and the damage. By using advanced optimisation techniques, two types of predictive models are found. In the first model, the formula is found in terms of 2 parameters of explosion length and distance from explosion centre. However, the 2nd model has 3 parameters of explosion length, distance, and also the natural period of the blast wall. These predictive models are then used to find explosion damages and ductility ratio. The results are compared with FEM analysis and pressure-impulse (P-I) method. It is shown that both types of models fit well with the outputs of the simulation. Moreover, results of both models are close to FEM analysis. The comparison tables provided in this paper show that, in the asymptotic region of P-I diagrams, results are not accurate. Therefore, this new method is superior to classical pressure-impulse (P-I) diagrams in the literature. Advantage of the new method is the easy damage assessment by using simple empirical-type formulas. Therefore, the researchers can use the method in this paper, for damage assessment in other types of blast resistive structures.\",\"published_in\":\"Advances in Civil Engineering, Vol 2019 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Engineering (General).

The maximum pressure of pipe near the explosion point increases linearly with the increase of explosive equivalent, and a proportional relation is observed between the fracture width of pipe and the explosive equivalent. The degree and duration of pavement deformation increase significantly with the increase of explosive equivalents. The dynamic response of the pipes is rarely affected by the buried depth, and the change of maximum effective stress is no more than 7%. However, the buried depth is of great influence on the damage degree of pavement. When the buried depth increases from 0.9 m to 1.5 m, the pavement deformation can be reduced effectively. The variation rule of pavement deformation is similar to the change rule of maximum overpressure and effective plastic stress; they change in the form of concave functions with the increase of buried depth. The results can provide theoretical basis for municipal pipeline construction design and urban safety planning and provide references for the risk assessment of gas explosion in buried pipelines.\",\"published_in\":\"Advances in Civil Engineering, Vol 2020 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Engineering (General).

An explosion index can be used to estimate explosion severity. In this study, the moisture content parameter, one of the intrinsic characteristics of coal dust, was used to estimate the explosion index. For this purpose, 32 samples of coal with different moisture content were collected from different mines in Iran and were prepared as coal rounds. The coal dust explosion process was carried out in a 2-litre closed chamber. After determining the most important and influential parameters, prediction models of the explosion index were presented using linear regression. For this purpose, 75 percent of data was randomly assigned for training and 25 percent of data was used for testing and validation. The performance of these models was assessed through the root mean square error (RMSE), the proportion of variance accounted for (VAF), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the mean absolute error (MAE). Then the results of the laboratory method were compared with the results of the regression model.

The results show that the temperature distribution of the dynamic explosion temperature field is affected by the velocity of the charge, and the temperature distribution of the temperature field is different with the change of the charge velocity. Through the analysis and fitting of the simulation data, the temperature calculation formula of the static and dynamic explosion temperature field is obtained, which can better establish the relationship between the temperature peak of the static and dynamic explosion temperature field and various influencing factors, and use this function.

GC, UPLC, HPLC, and GC\\u2010MS techniques were used to analyze the quality characteristics of the prepared flaxseed oil. These included the food safety risk indices, micronutrient components, and oxidative stability. The effects of different steam explosion pressures on the quality characteristics and relative volatile components of flaxseed oil were also investigated. The results revealed that steam explosion pretreatment technology could significantly increase the oil yield, improve micronutrient content, and strengthen the oxidation stability of the product. Moreover, the food safety risk indices (e.g., benzopyrene) were controlled within a reasonable range, while the fatty acid content remained almost unchanged. Notably, the relative pyrazine content in the total volatile components of flaxseed oil was 68.25% when the steam explosion pressure reached 1.2 MPa. This was considered as the main factor that contributed to the unique concentrated fragrance of the produced flaxseed oil. To prove the superiority of the steam explosion pretreatment, we compared this technique with traditional high\\u2010temperature roasting and popular microwave pretreatment techniques. The results revealed that flaxseed oil prepared by steam explosion pretreatment displayed the best quality characteristics and most concentrated fragrance. Thus, steam explosion technology shows great potential for application to produce high\\u2010quality concentrated fragrance flaxseed oil.

In this study, the researcher observes the cost of explosion used by PT Vitrama Properti in its mining of granites. According to the economic analysis, to determine the cost of explosion need to count on the breakeven point. The method employed in this research is to analyze the breakeven point. Breakeven point is a calculation used to know the volume of explosion rate so that the total income and total cost will be at the breakeven point. The data collection is conducted from December 2016 to February 2017, including the data of drilling cost, explosion usage cost, the salary of employees and contract employees, excavators and dump trucks fuel cost, equipment ownership cost, and the specification of explosion tools and equipment. The result of the data analysis shows that the total explosion cost paid by PT Vitrama Properti in January 2017 is Rp.1,041,936,063,00 and the total income earned is Rp.1,287,134,940.00, so the total profit made is Rp.245,198,976.00. Whereas, the breakeven point of PT Vitrama Properti in January 2017 is on the explosion volume rate of 23,109.08 m3 with the total earning and total cost is Rp.841,170,781.00. One of the significant factors to reduce the cost of explosion is to improve the geometry of explosion and to make the effective use of ANFO. After implementing the improved geometry of the explosion, the breakeven point is also improved from the volume rate of 23,109.08 m3 to the volume rate of 21,090.35 m3. Also, to increase the income from the explosion process can be done by increasing the sale of granite from the explosion (boulder) into 7,072.17 m3 with the total income of Rp.257,426,988.00, as well as by increasing the total product sale of 24,752.59 m3 with the total income obtained of Rp.900,994,458.00.\",\"published_in\":\"MINERAL; Vol 2 No 2 (2017): MINERAL; 69-77 ; 2620-729X ; 2540-7708\",\"year\":\"2020-01-30\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Susanto, Hendra; Tono, E.P.S.B Taman; Pitulima, Janiar\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.ubb.ac.id\\/index.php\\/mineral\\/article\\/view\\/1561\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"cee40e8e73edee9e83df334c5c87499104160c542e5032d4230c740747a17c3e\",\"relevance\":43,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9c25281bf914136f62f5a01814e1a5f5975023c4314552385fa15f44036e7aec\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.unnes.ac.id\\/sju\\/index.php\\/higeia\\/article\\/view\\/30202\\/14692; https:\\/\\/journal.unnes.ac.id\\/sju\\/index.php\\/higeia\\/article\\/view\\/30202; doi:10.15294\\/higeia.v3i4.30202\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.unnes.ac.id\\/sju\\/index.php\\/higeia\\/article\\/view\\/30202; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15294\\/higeia.v3i4.30202\",\"title\":\"Analisis Potensi Bahaya Metal Dust Explosion Menggunakan Metode Fault Tree Analysis\",\"paper_abstract\":\"ABSTRAK CSB menemukan rata-rata sekitar 10 insiden dust explosion terjadi per tahun pada rentang waktu 25 tahun.

Explosion risk assessment and structure blast analysis are essential for these production facilities, and research studies have been carried out. Explosion due to blowout during drilling operation is also a critical risk for drilling units, and this has not been researched much until the accident of the drilling unit in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. This paper provides the risk and evaluation of explosion and structure under blast pressure during the drilling operation, whereas previous research studies have mainly been interested in process plants. This study suggests weight saving in drilling units through the consideration of the actual behavior of gas explosion. Weight saving is the priority of offshore unit design due to payload.

Aluminium, magnesium, titanium, iron and zinc were considered and their explosion safety parameters were analysed as a function of their mean primary particle size either determined by BET measurements, particle size distribution. To depict the course of explosion behaviour for these metals, extensive literature review has been performed and additional experimental tests were also performed. Generally, decreasing the particle size in a metallic powder leads to a higher explosion severity. It appears that this statement is true till a critical Diameter below which the explosion severity (pmax, dp\\/dtmax) decreases for all the considered powders. This critical size can be explained by theoretical considerations on the nature of thermal transfer in the flame, namely by analysing the Cassel model. Finally, semi-empirical models were also developed for aluminium to highlight the specific micrometre and nanometre behaviour and the influence of turbulence, particle burning time, Diameter and concentration. The influence of these key parameters needs to be further assessed in a future work in order to better understand the mechanisms involved and to extend the scope to other powdered materials.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"ddc:624\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Krietsch, Arne; Vignes, A.; Dufaud, O.; Santandr\\u00e9a, A.; Perrin, L.; Bouillard, J.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/opus4.kobv.de\\/opus4-bam\\/frontdoor\\/index\\/index\\/docId\\/48711\",\"oa_state\":\"0\",\"url\":\"9d9da315cd8182e04fb06d3db47f32a054fff2c8b3f7af403772909814e0331b\",\"relevance\":38,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"cd0e7924beeec0df8a4363a7d8702cb24cddc9370a8e47264d494fc63baaf020\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/hdl\\/11585\\/706310; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11585\\/706310; doi:10.1016\\/j.jlp.2019.103920; 2-s2.0-85069736690\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11585\\/706310; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.jlp.2019.103920\",\"title\":\"Influence of initial temperature and pressure on the explosion behavior of n-dodecane\\/air mixtures\",\"paper_abstract\":\"There is an increasing industrial interest towards long-chain hydrocarbons, also due to the fact that they can be obtained from renewable organic materials. These substances are flammable and, under certain conditions, can explode. Nevertheless, very few experimental data are available on their thermal and kinetic characteristics and, more specifically, on their flammability and explosion behavior under various process conditions. In the work presented in this paper, the explosion behavior of n-dodecane has been investigated through experiments performed in a closed 5-l cylindrical vessel by varying the concentration of (vaporized) fuel in air at different initial temperatures - 130 \\u00b0C and 160 \\u00b0C - and pressures - 1, 2 and 3 bar. From the recorded pressure-time histories, the most important parameters for the assessment of process hazards and the safe design of process equipment - maximum pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, and deflagration index - have been quantified. It has been found that, prior to feeding air and igniting the fuel\\/air mixture, the n-dodecane injected into the explosion vessel undergoes pyrolysis phenomena that interfere with combustion, thus affecting the performed measurements. On the basis of these results, it can be expected that pyrolysis also affects the flammability and explosion behavior of long-chain hydrocarbons others than n-dodecane involved in industrial processes at high temperature and, thus, it should be taken into consideration when addressing safety-related issues. \\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Closed-vessel explosion; Deflagration index; Initial conditions; Maximum pressure; n-Dodecane; Pyrolysis\",\"subject\":\"Closed-vessel explosion; Deflagration index; Initial conditions; Maximum pressure; n-Dodecane; Pyrolysis\",\"authors\":\"Cammarota, F.; Di Benedetto, A.; Di Sarli, V.; Salzano, E.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11585\\/706310\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"cd0e7924beeec0df8a4363a7d8702cb24cddc9370a8e47264d494fc63baaf020\",\"relevance\":37,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"4ba273776d8284405d4978e310cc57ebce02229d96edc659bfaa15dc182e7340\",\"relation\":\"10.1016\\/j.engfailanal.2019.01.007; Engineering Failure Analysis; Makale - Uluslararas\\u0131 Hakemli Dergi - Kurum \\u00d6\\u011fretim Eleman\\u0131; Web of Science - Scopus; Web of Science Core Collection - Science Citation Index Expanded; 1350-6307; 1873-1961; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.engfailanal.2019.01.007; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12508\\/579; 97; 288; 299\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12508\\/579; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.engfailanal.2019.01.007\",\"title\":\"Crankcase explosion for two-stroke marine diesel engine by using fault tree analysis method in fuzzy environment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"WOS: 000456719900023 ; The purpose of this study is to investigate crankcase explosion in two-stroke marine diesel engine systematically by using fault tree analysis method in fuzzy environment for system reliability and shipping sustainability.

To prevent disastrous damages, the Task Committee on Design of Blast Resistant Buildings in Petrochemical Facilities of the ASCE suggested several empirical methods to determine gas explosion blast loads for the structural design of petrochemical facilities. However, the procedures for determining overpressure from gas explosion are not easy for practicing engineers to follow, due to the complexity of gas explosion mechanisms and numerous affecting factors. In addition, the blast loads are greatly influenced by the class or Mach number in the empirical methods, but high uncertainty exists in selecting a reasonable class or Mach number for preliminary design. In an effort to reduce the difficulty and ambiguity, this study provides a thorough review and comparative analysis of the empirical methods suggested by ASCE for determining overpressure from gas explosion. In addition, this paper presents a case study that demonstrates the determination of blast loads in accordance with the ASCE guidelines.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-08\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Ree, Suhyun; Kang, Thomas H.-K.; Lee, Hyerin; Shin, Myoungsu\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholarworks.unist.ac.kr\\/handle\\/201301\\/32963\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d66ca5c4c8c67ca2c9b5c93063cd793cfb979ce84d46a506c235bd15ff6d2a4f\",\"relevance\":34,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2169cf863cfa9b640002c6e6d9934cfe655d14df70c4f246a1c1e8c8f987cdc9\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.doiserbia.nb.rs\\/img\\/doi\\/0354-9836\\/2020\\/0354-98362000020F.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0354-9836; 0354-9836; doi:10.2298\\/TSCI190626020F; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/29472db39332484f878fbf3de5a52356\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.2298\\/TSCI190626020F; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/29472db39332484f878fbf3de5a52356\",\"title\":\"Design of explosion-proof control system for liquefied gas tank leakage based on data fusion\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Aiming at the problems of low system efficiency and high energy consumption of nodes in the current explosion-proof control system for liquefied gas tank leakage, a data fusion-based explosion-proof control system for liquefied gas tank leakage is designed.

Confidence in event screening can be increased if multiple independent approaches are used. We describe a new approach to event screening using the seismic moment tensor and its representation on the hypersphere, specifically the 5-sphere of 6-degree unit vectors representing the normalized symmetric moment tensor. The sample of moment tensors from an explosion data set is unimodal on the 5-sphere and can be parametrized by the Langevin distribution, which is sometimes referred to as the Normal distribution on the hypersphere. Screening is then accomplished by finding the angle from the explosion population mean to any newly measured moment tensor and testing if that angle is in the tail of the Langevin distribution (conservatively quantified as greater than 99.9 per cent of the cumulative density). We apply the screen to a sample of earthquakes from the Western USA and the September 2017 explosion and subsequent collapse at the Pungyye-Ri Test Site in North Korea.

In this study, a numerical model of gas explosion in a residential building was developed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The numerical simulations were performed for different gas cloud filling regions and equivalence ratios to identify the initial scenario, and the simulation results were compared with the real consequences of gas explosion. Additionally, the temporal and spatial evolvement characteristics of explosion overpressure and indoor temperature were analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of vent area ratio and the activation pressure of vent panels in the kitchen were investigated to propose effective mitigation measures for the gas explosions inside residential buildings. The results show that the simulation results reproduced by the CFD model are in good agreement with the real accident consequences. During the explosion process, the overpressure distribution in a room is almost uniform at the same moment and there exists little spatial difference. The maximum temperature can reach up to 1953\\u00b0C, which can cause secondary fire accidents easily. The maximum flame speed is in the range of 34.3 m\\/s and 230.9 m\\/s. It indicates that gas explosion inside residential buildings is a typical deflagration process. When the vent area ratio is less than 0.3, the overpressure peaks decrease rapidly with the increase of the vent area ratio. However, when the vent area ratio is larger than 0.3, the overpressure peaks are almost independent on the vent area ratio. There is a proportional relationship between the overpressure peaks and the activation pressure of vent panels. These achievements provide reliable reference data for the accident investigation of gas explosion and subsequent treatment.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Kang Cen; Bin Song; Ruiqing Shen; Yidong Zhang; Wuge Yu; Qingsheng Wang\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/2068958\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"18388d58c11dd40c4c3b96d8877042004ec8eed516f6bf0eed7c2bb777738308\",\"relevance\":26,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/2068958\"},{\"id\":\"aa3e2c7ec9689eca376d56c8d08ffa1656fe341fd61f0fe9827732372dad9a8d\",\"relation\":\"Sustainability; Sustainability, 1 Feb. 2020, v. 12, no. 3, 1169, p. 1-16; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10397\\/82320; 1; 16; 12; 3; doi:10.3390\\/su12031169; WOS:000524899603003; 2-s2.0-85081276021; 2071-1050; 1169\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10397\\/82320; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su12031169\",\"title\":\"Risk perception and property value : evidence from Prot Tianjin Port explosion\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper aims to investigate the perceived risk after the Tianjin port explosion event and its impact on property value.

This study demonstrates an indirect method to estimate the perceived risk of the general public and provides valuable insight into sustainable port management policies. ; Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies ; 202006 bcrc ; published_final\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Tianjin port explosion; Risk perception; Property value; Difference-in-differences; The housing market\",\"subject\":\"Tianjin port explosion; Risk perception; Property value; Difference-in-differences; The housing market\",\"authors\":\"Huang, Y; Yip, TL; Liang, C\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10397\\/82320\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"aa3e2c7ec9689eca376d56c8d08ffa1656fe341fd61f0fe9827732372dad9a8d\",\"relevance\":25,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"d7fe606757dc844773610bee86aad8fa4617d2ad41c92c49ef487449dd3241c5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/epubs.surrey.ac.uk\\/858640\\/; http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1021\\/acsomega.0c03280; 10.1021\\/acsomega.0c03280; http:\\/\\/epubs.surrey.ac.uk\\/858640\\/1\\/Experimental%20investigation%20of%20the%20impact%20of%20CO%20-%20AAM.docx; Wang, Hua, Gu, Sai and Chen, Tao (2020) Experimental Investigation of the Impact of CO, C\\u2082H\\u2086, and H\\u2082 on the Explosion Characteristics of CH\\u2084 ACS Omega, 5 (38). pp. 24684-24692.; doi:10.1021\\/acsomega.0c03280\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/epubs.surrey.ac.uk\\/858640\\/1\\/Experimental%20investigation%20of%20the%20impact%20of%20CO%20-%20AAM.docx; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1021\\/acsomega.0c03280\",\"title\":\"Experimental Investigation of the Impact of CO, C\\u2082H\\u2086, and H\\u2082 on the Explosion Characteristics of CH\\u2084\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Gas explosions are destructive disasters in coal mines.

In general, the explosion-energy evolution is monotonic and relatively smooth, suggesting a possible analytic solution. We derive analytic solutions for the expansion of the gain region under the following assumptions: spherical symmetry, one-zone shell, and powered by neutrinos and \\u03b1 particle recombination. We consider two hypotheses: (I) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos and \\u03b1 recombination and (II) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos alone. Under these assumptions, we derive the fundamental dimensionless parameters and analytic scalings. For the neutrino-only hypothesis (II), the asymptotic explosion energy scales as $E_{\\\\infty } \\\\approx 1.5 M_\\\\mathrm{ g} u _0^2 \\\\eta ^{2\\/3}$, where Mg is the gain mass, $ u _0$ is the free-fall velocity at the shock, and \\u03b7 is a ratio of the heating and dynamical time-scales. Including both neutrinos and recombination (hypothesis I), the asymptotic explosion energy is $E_{\\\\infty } \\\\approx M_g u _0^2 (1.5\\\\eta ^{2\\/3} + \\\\beta f(\\\\rho _0))$, where \\u03b2 is the dimensionless recombination parameter. We use Bayesian inference to fit these analytic models to simulations. Both hypotheses fit the simulations of the lowest progenitor masses that tend to explode spherically. The fits do not prefer hypothesis I or II; however, prior investigations suggest that \\u03b1 recombination is important. As expected, neither hypothesis fits the higher mass simulations that exhibit aspherical explosions. In summary, this explosion energy theory is consistent with the spherical explosions of low progenitor masses; the inconsistency with higher progenitor-mass simulations suggests that a theory for them must include aspherical dynamics.\",\"published_in\":\"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ; volume 500, issue 4, page 5393-5407 ; ISSN 0035-8711 1365-2966\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Space and Planetary Science; Astronomy and Astrophysics\",\"subject\":\"Space and Planetary Science; Astronomy and Astrophysics\",\"authors\":\"Gogilashvili, Mariam; Murphy, Jeremiah W; Mabanta, Quintin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/mnras\\/staa3546\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1bd7f1943faf08190e16e06d3ceabd947607d99a06ab7e30f5c50d6de2070a15\",\"relevance\":23,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/mnras\\/staa3546\"},{\"id\":\"a8365c26c25349851d6aa7fe2a19f0d25c851b54f62ca4a92f4310c001577d1a\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/6824819; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1070-9622; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1875-9203; 1070-9622; 1875-9203; doi:10.1155\\/2019\\/6824819; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/8d7a1907818b473ba843d52aaa4d5a7b\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/6824819; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/8d7a1907818b473ba843d52aaa4d5a7b\",\"title\":\"Experimental and Numerical Simulation Study on the Shock and Vibration Effect of OD1422-X80 Mainline Natural Gas Pipeline Explosion\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this paper, the explosion experiment of the OD1422-X80 natural gas pipeline was carried out. The phenomenon of pipeline explosion was recorded, and a large amount of data on vibration effects were obtained. The data showed that the ground vibration during the explosion was mainly caused by the physical explosion process, and the subsequent gas explosion did not produce strong vibration. Based on the ANSYS\\/LS-DYNA platform, a numerical calculation model of this experiment was established. The numerical results agreed well with the experimental results. Simulation and experimental results showed that when the gas pressure in the pipe was lower than 7 MPa, the pipeline cracks stop growing. The maximum speed of the pipe wall moving outward reached 50 m\\/s, which formed a huge impact compression effect on the surrounding soil. This state spread to distant places and gradually decayed into an elastic stress wave, which formed a ground vibration effect. Time-frequency analysis was introduced into the vibration signal processing. The analysis results showed that the main frequency of pipeline explosion vibration was distributed around 10 Hz and had a long duration. The research results provided a reference for subsequent gas pipeline explosion test and numerical simulation research.\",\"published_in\":\"Shock and Vibration, Vol 2019 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Physics; QC1-999\",\"subject\":\"Physics; \",\"authors\":\"Huayuan Ma; Mingshou Zhong; Xinghua Li; Quanmin Xie; You Zhou; Qin Yin\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/6824819\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a8365c26c25349851d6aa7fe2a19f0d25c851b54f62ca4a92f4310c001577d1a\",\"relevance\":22,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1155\\/2019\\/6824819\"},{\"id\":\"06014ce8327d1408bcc431b0a3f0d6f04351cc699505c04ddc493928c18c0acd\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/au-research\\/grants\\/arc\\/CE170100004; http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/au-research\\/grants\\/arc\\/FT160100035; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/450725; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/mnras\\/stz1304\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/450725; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/mnras\\/stz1304\",\"title\":\"Gravitational wave emission from 3D explosion models of core-collapse supernovae with low and normal explosion energies\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Understanding gravitational wave emission from core-collapse supernovae will be essential for their detection with current and future gravitational wave detectors. This requires a sample of waveforms from modern 3D supernova simulations reaching well into the explosion phase, where gravitational wave emission is expected to peak. However, recent waveforms from 3D simulations with multigroup neutrino transport do not reach far into the explosion phase, and some are still obtained from non-exploding models. We therefore calculate waveforms up to 0.9 s after bounce using the neutrino hydrodynamics code COCONUT-FMT. We consider two models with low and normal explosion energy, namely explosions of an ultra-stripped progenitor with an initial helium star mass of 3.5 M-circle dot, and of an 18 M-circle dot single star. Both models show gravitational wave emission from the excitation of surface g modes in the proto-neutron star with frequencies between similar to 800 and 1000 Hz at peak emission. The peak amplitudes are about 6 and 10 cm, respectively, which is somewhat higher than in most recent 3D models of the pre-explosion or early explosion phase. Using a Bayesian analysis, we determine the maximum detection distances for our models in simulated Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and Einstein Telescope (ET) design sensitivity noise.

In this study, a numerical model of gas explosion in a residential building was developed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The numerical simulations were performed for different gas cloud filling regions and equivalence ratios to identify the initial scenario, and the simulation results were compared with the real consequences of gas explosion. Additionally, the temporal and spatial evolvement characteristics of explosion overpressure and indoor temperature were analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of vent area ratio and the activation pressure of vent panels in the kitchen were investigated to propose effective mitigation measures for the gas explosions inside residential buildings. The results show that the simulation results reproduced by the CFD model are in good agreement with the real accident consequences. During the explosion process, the overpressure distribution in a room is almost uniform at the same moment and there exists little spatial difference. The maximum temperature can reach up to 1953\\u00b0C, which can cause secondary fire accidents easily. The maximum flame speed is in the range of 34.3 m\\/s and 230.9 m\\/s. It indicates that gas explosion inside residential buildings is a typical deflagration process. When the vent area ratio is less than 0.3, the overpressure peaks decrease rapidly with the increase of the vent area ratio. However, when the vent area ratio is larger than 0.3, the overpressure peaks are almost independent on the vent area ratio. There is a proportional relationship between the overpressure peaks and the activation pressure of vent panels. These achievements provide reliable reference data for the accident investigation of gas explosion and subsequent treatment.\",\"published_in\":\"Mathematical Problems in Engineering, Vol 2019 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Engineering (General).

Our main conclusion is that in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism the remnant of a pulsar in these low-energy CCSNe has some significance, in that the launching of jets by the newly born neutron star (NS) spins-up the NS and create a pulsar. We crudely estimated the period of the pulsars to be tens of milliseconds in these cases. The convective zones seed perturbations that lead to accretion of stochastic angular momentum that in turn is assumed to launch jittering jets in this explosion mechanism.

For the lowest stellar masses, we study, MZAMS \\u2243 8.5\\u201311 M\\u2299, the binding energy above the convective zones is low, and so is the expected explosion energy in the jittering jets explosion mechanism that works in a negative feedback cycle.

Explosion chambers of the two volumes, 20 l and 1 m\\u00b3, specified in the Standard, were used to carry out standard procedures according to EN 14034 to determine hybrid mixture explosion parameters such as maximum overpressure and maximum rate of pressure rise. Three flammable dusts widely accepted as standards were chosen \\u2013 Pittsburgh seam bituminous coal dust, Lycopodium Clavatum spores and Niacin. Two flammable gases (methane and hydrogen) were used. Methane and hydrogen are used for standard testing of flammable gas mixtures explosion parameters in explosion chambers. The explosion parameters of various mixtures of flammable dusts, flammable gases and air were measured. Standard ignition sources for dust dispersion, two 5 kJ chemical igniters, were used in both chambers. Explosion parameters were also measured using the standard permanent spark described in EN 15967 as an ignition source for a comparison of the effect of different ignition energies on explosion parameters. The results show a significant increase of normalised maximum rates of pressure rise in a 20 l chamber compared with a 1 m\\u00b3 chamber caused by higher turbulence levels in the smaller chamber.

The results show that the explosion propagation of lignite dust in the 20L spherical explosion test system has four different stages: the first explosion stage, the full explosion combustion stage, the continuous combustion stage and the combustion attenuation stage. The test results are slightly different from that of the fluent simulation of lignite dust explosion by using the high-speed camera to collect the dust explosion images.

The results show the following. (1) The mathematical models for numerical simulation of gas explosion can accurately simulate the gas explosion and its propagation process. The time-space step size has a great influence on the simulation results. The grid spacing for numerical simulation of mine gas explosion is determined to be 0.1 m and the time step length is determined to be 0.001 s. (2) The ignition energy has a limited effect on gas explosion characteristics. It only has a certain influence on the gas explosion process, but has little influence on the overpressure of shock wave. The larger the ignition energy is, the faster the explosion reaction speed is, and the maximum overpressure increases slightly. When the ignition energy increases to a certain value, the time of peak shock wave and the maximum overpressure both tend to be stable. The ignition energy has little effect on gas explosion characteristics when an explosion accident occurs underground with a large amount of gas accumulation. (3) The gas explosion equivalent has a great influence on the overpressure of gas explosion shock wave. The higher the explosion equivalent is, the greater the pressure is, and the peak value of the shock wave overpressure increases with the explosion equivalent as a power function. The research results have important guiding significance for the research and development of new technology for prevention and control of gas explosion.

The dust samples came from Populus alba L., Pinus massoniana Lamb., and Cinnamonum camphora (L.) Pres., species that are commonly utilized in medium density fiberboard production in China. The thermogravimetric characteristics, element composition, and morphology of dust samples were analyzed to help explain the explosion phenomena in a 20 L sphere. The analysis showed that both the maximum explosion pressure and explosion index of wood dust presented a decreasing trend with increasing particle size, and the maximum explosion pressure values were in the range of 7 to 9 bar, regardless of species. For both explosion pressure and explosion index values, the wood dust with similar particle sizes were different, which are ranked as Populus alba > Cinnamonum camphora > Pinus massoniana. In addition, for the explosion pressure of wood dust with similar particle size, the dust concentration had threshold values. Additionally, the particle size and dust concentration had a synergistic effect on the explosion pressure and explosion index. Wood dust with a smaller particle size is more likely to explode at the threshold of concentration.

During coal exploitation, coal dust explosion has been one of the most common and serious disasters. Nevertheless, the generated dust can suspend in the air, further leading to a secondary explosion. However, there are limited studies focusing on the propagation characteristics of secondary explosion induced by coal dust. Therefore, this paper aims to detect coal dust explosion in a pipe network and investigate the secondary explosion caused by the first explosion. In specific, this paper numerically analyzed the propagation characteristics of first and secondary explosion of coal dust in aspects of flame temperature, airflow rate and CO mass concentration. The results indicate that the maximum flame temperature of the secondary explosion of coal dust could reach up to 4500 K, which was more intense than the first explosion. After the secondary explosion, the air velocity witnessed a significant increase, compared with the first explosion, but the air velocity at the linear section of the pipe network witnessed the highest because of the air supplement at two sides. Different from the highest CO concentration at the ignition area in the first explosion, the CO concentration in the secondary explosion source area decreased rapidly and the maximum CO concentration appeared in the flame front. Moreover, because of enough oxygen supplement, the explosion reaction was much more sufficient, so that the maximum CO concentration was less than that in the first explosion.

However, this gas is flammable and explosive during pipeline transportation and easily causes an explosion. In order to achieve safe transmission, the explosion characteristics and propagation law of low\\u2010concentration gas are systematically studied through a large\\u2010scale pipeline experimental system. We found that the peak pressure of low\\u2010concentration gas explosion in pipeline has a quadratic function relationship with the propagation distance. Moreover, the peak pressure of gas explosion initially decreases from the explosion source, and then a turning point appears after a certain distance of propagation, which is followed by a sharp increase of peak pressure of gas explosion. The explosion pressure becomes maximum at the outlets of a pipeline. The arrival time of explosion flame is logarithmically relevant to propagation distance, while the speed of flame propagation gradually increases along with the increase of propagation distance. The flame propagation is faster at the exit point. In addition, the diameter of pipeline has also an important influence on the explosion propagation process of low\\u2010concentration gas. So, the larger the diameter, the higher the explosion pressure. The explosion pressure of DN700 pipeline is obviously higher than that of DN500, and the explosion pressure rises faster; the speed of flame propagation of gas explosion in DN700 pipeline is also higher than that in DN500 pipeline.

In the presence of a sufficient amount of oxygen and an ignition source, such a situation could lead to explosion that may result in the destruction of building structures and the building in general. Strengthening the stability of supporting structures is aimed at protecting industrial premises against possible destruction by explosion indoors. One of the effective ways to protect construction structures against the excessive pressure of explosion is to use explosion venting panels. In order to solve practical tasks on protecting industrial premises and structures against explosion, one must be able to choose both the area and parameters for explosion venting panels. In addition, in order to reduce the related loads to safe quantities, it is necessary to properly calculate the bearing structures in terms of dynamic stability while maintaining their carrying capacity. The set task to ensure protection against explosion by applying explosion venting panels with flexible elements can be solved through integrated accounting for mechanical properties of cellular polycarbonate sheets. We have performed experimental research into performance of the inertia-free explosion venting panels with flexible enclosing elements exposed to dynamic loads under conditions of explosion. Based on the obtained results, the effective rigidity and critical displacement of cellular polycarbonate sheets of flexible elements have been determined.

In this method, only the explosion energy and distance from the centre of explosion are required to find the damage by using simple predictive models in terms of empirical-type formulas. The explosion model herein is a TNO multiphysic method. This provides the maximum overpressure and pulse duration in terms of the explosion length and distance from explosion centre. Thereafter, the obtained results are combined with the SDOF model of the blast wall to determine the ductility ratio and the damage. By using advanced optimisation techniques, two types of predictive models are found. In the first model, the formula is found in terms of 2 parameters of explosion length and distance from explosion centre. However, the 2nd model has 3 parameters of explosion length, distance, and also the natural period of the blast wall. These predictive models are then used to find explosion damages and ductility ratio. The results are compared with FEM analysis and pressure-impulse (P-I) method. It is shown that both types of models fit well with the outputs of the simulation. Moreover, results of both models are close to FEM analysis. The comparison tables provided in this paper show that, in the asymptotic region of P-I diagrams, results are not accurate. Therefore, this new method is superior to classical pressure-impulse (P-I) diagrams in the literature. Advantage of the new method is the easy damage assessment by using simple empirical-type formulas. Therefore, the researchers can use the method in this paper, for damage assessment in other types of blast resistive structures.

The steel\\u2013concrete composite bridge is widely used in expressways and urban viaducts. Explosives are distributed in multiple locations above the deck to avoid stress concentration. The explosion damage analysis is carried out with the equivalent trinitrotoluene of 50 kg, which represents a car explosion in the state of full oil tank. The multi-Euler domain method based on the fully coupled Lagrange and Euler models is adopted for the structural analysis of the explosion process with the commercial software Autodyn. This study shows that the structural failure goes through three stages: elastoplastic, plastic, and plastic hinge with full section. From 1\\/8 to 1\\/2 of the bridge span, the failure times of the bridge are 277, 164, 133, and 133 ms, matching the displacements of 412, 889, 819, and 819 mm, respectively, while the explosion occurs above steel beams. For the explosion occurring above the concrete deck, the failure times are 335, 154, 121, and 125 ms, corresponding to the deflections of 479, 930, 722, and 752 mm. When the explosion occurs from bearings to the quarter of the bridge span, shear failure of steel beams occurs before bending failure, and both of them control the explosion-resistant design of structures. For the detonation occurring at 1\\/4 to 1\\/2 of the bridge length, the explosion damage of the steel\\u2013concrete composite bridge is controlled by flexural failure, and only local shear failure occurs. The multi-beam steel\\u2013concrete composite bridge which meets the design requirements will generate plastic hinge and lose bearing capacity under car explosion wherever the explosion occurs.

The rapid pressure developed during a dust explosion can be mitigated by venting. The present work explored the effects of venting on the explosion of different mixing weight ratios of aluminium and silver powder mixtures. The explosion characteristics of aluminium-silver mixtures were assessed in a 0.0012 m3 confined and vented cylindrical vessel. It was found that the application of 0.1 bar static burst pressure (Pstat) venting membrane gives one tenth reduction on explosion pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise for 70:30 and 50:50 mixing weight ratios of aluminium-silver mixtures explosion, respectively. This finding suggests that besides the venting application effect, the oxidation reaction of aluminium could be disrupted due to the presence of silver powder in the metal mixtures which results in lower heat transfer and reduction of the mass burning rate, hence, lessen flame speeds and explosion severity. However, the venting effectiveness is reduced when the Pstat increases. In order to assess the applicability of the dust explosion venting standard; NFPA 68 and EN 14491, the experimental results were compared with the calculated values according to the standards. The comparative results show that, both NFPA 68 and EN 14491 give underestimated values for explosion venting as compared with the experimental results.

[Methods] The dynamic response of the 45 # clamped air-back steel plate with diameter of 600 mm and thickness of 5 mm subjected to multiple underwater explosion loading was studied by a method of combining experiment and numerical simulation. The plastic deformation history of the steel plate was obtained and the basic law of plastic deformation was analyzed. [Results] The results show that the morphology produced by plastic deformation of the 45 # clamped air-back steel plate subjected to multiple underwater explosion loading is spherical-like,and the deformation mode is mainly bending deformation and biaxial tensile deformation. When the amount of explosive and the explosion distance are fixed,the deflection increment of the center of the steel plate will be decreased gradually as the number of underwater explosion loading increased,and after the second explosion loading,the deflection increment will be third-order of the first explosion loading. When the total amount of explosive is constant,compared with the results of multiple uniform underwater explosion loading,both the deflection and thickness reduction rate of the steel plate after single underwater explosion loading are larger,and the maximum difference of the center deflection is 20.25%.

The vertical well had a diameter of 0.7 m and different depths (2 m, 4 m, and 6 m), and the horizontal well had a diameter of 0.8 m and a length of 20 m at both sides. The effects of different ignition positions, well depths, and gas compositions and concentrations on the explosion characteristics and rules governing the propagation of flammable gases in a municipal sewage pipeline were investigated. The findings suggest that different ignition positions (at the top, middle, and bottom of the inspection well) did not lead to a significant difference between peak explosion pressure and temperatures but had a substantial influence on the propagation velocity of the explosion flame near the corner of the junction between the vertical inspection well and the horizontal well. Different inspection well depths had no significant impact on the peak explosion pressure or temperature but had a substantial effect on the propagation velocity of the explosion flame at the bottom of the well. Compared with a methane (CH4) explosion at a concentration of 6%, the peak explosion pressure, peak explosion temperature, and flame propagation velocity of a CH4 and oil-gas mixture at a concentration ratio of 6% : 1% were found to be significantly higher. With increasing oil-gas concentrations (2%, 4%, and 6%), the peak pressure, temperature, and flame propagation velocity continued to decrease. The findings of this study can help prevent explosion accidents in municipal sewage pipelines and provide a reference to support the establishment of related standards. Engineering (General).

The explosion characteristics and flame propagation behavior of oil shale dust are worth studying. The difference between the multiple explosion behaviors of oil shale dust was investigated with the use of a 20 L explosive spherical tank and a dust MIE experimental device. The explosion characteristics and microstructure changes of the explosive products in multiple explosions were examined. The experimental results show that the maximum explosion pressure (Pmax) dropped, and simultaneously, the minimum ignition energy (MIE), the explosion time (t), and the maximum rate of pressure rise (dp\\/dtmax) increased as the explosions continued. Furthermore, the oil shale continued exploding until the third explosion. Some original oil shale dust (OOSD) and explosive residues were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. The SEM images of the explosive residues indicate a high fragmentation degree and well-developed pore structure during the entire multiexplosion process. Oxygen-containing functional groups, the aliphatic C-H bond, and the aromatic C-H bond in oil shale dust all participated in the oil shale dust explosion process.

It is generally accepted that most vapor explosion phenomena fall into three different modes of contact; fuel pouring into coolant, coolant injection into fuel and stratified fuel-coolant layers. In this study, we review previous stratified steam explosion experiments as well as recent experiments performed at the KTH in Sweden. While experiments with prototypic reactor materials are minimal, we do note that generally the energetics is limited for the stratified mode of contact. When the fuel mass involved in a steam explosion in a stratified geometry is compared to a pool geometry based on geometrical aspects, one can conclude that there is a very limited set of conditions (when melt jet diameter is small) under which a steam explosion is more energetic in a stratified geometry. However, under these limited conditions the absolute energetic explosion output would still be small because the total fuel mass involved would be limited.

The ability to predict the reduced explosion pressure for a given vent area is crucial in the design of venting devices. In preceding publications by BASF, a model to predict the reduced explosion pressure was introduced. The model describes the pressure development inside the vessel using a zero-dimensional approach for the explosion. The mass reduction due to the vented gases is calculated from the Efflux function. To improve the accordance of the predicted explosion pressures with experimental data, the existing model is refined in the present work by applying a one-dimensional model to represent the flame propagation along the vessela centreline. This increases the accuracy of the predicted reduced explosion pressures compared to the previous version, especially for large vent areas. The explosion is described by an iterative routine for the combustion process and the induced flow velocities and turbulence. The integration of the effect of increased turbulence due to the flow of vented gases on the burning velocity was found to be crucial. Chemical engineering; TP155-156; Computer engineering.

A Difference-inDifferences approach was then applied based on the transaction records. The results indicated that the impact of the negative \\\"hazard effect\\\" on the average total price of property was not significantly higher than the positive \\\"renew effect\\\" in the nine months after the gas explosion. The net effect of the \\\"renew effect\\\" was more likely to increase the price as the gas explosion time passes. Moreover, the quantile analysis suggested that the high-priced properties significantly benefited from the \\\"renew effect\\\" after three months of gas explosion, while the positive effect on properties with low total price was significantly after nine months of the explosion. Overall, the total increase of the house price due to the net \\\"renew effect\\\" in the gas explosion area was higher than the total cost of the reconstruction and renovation contributed by the public and private sectors. \\u9ad8\\u96c4\\u6c23\\u7206;\\u5be6\\u50f9\\u767b\\u9304;\\u5730\\u7406\\u8cc7\\u8a0a\\u7cfb\\u7d71;\\u5dee\\u7570\\u4e2d\\u7684\\u5dee\\u7570\\u6cd5; Kaohsiung Gas Explosions; Real Estate Transaction; Geographic Information System; Difference-in-Differences  \\u6797\\u58eb\\u6df5; Lin , Shih-Yuan; \\u5f90\\u58eb\\u52db; Hsu, Shih-Hsun; \\u9673\\u742e\\u4ec1; Chen, Tsung-Jen\"},{\"id\":\"a57779efde37d3c688b03f616f1f2681277233a2fb7991dd2886955cb971a77d\",\"content\":\"Steam Explosion Pretreatment Changes Ruminal Fermentation in vitro of Corn Stover by Shifting Archaeal and Bacterial Community Structure Steam explosion is an environment-friendly pretreatment method to improve the subsequent hydrolysis process of lignocellulosic biomass. Steam explosion pretreatment improved ruminal fermentation and changed fermentation pattern of corn stover during ruminal fermentation in vitro. The study gave a comprehensive insight into how stream explosion pretreatment shifted archaeal and bacterial community structure to change ruminal fermentation in vitro of corn stover. Results showed that steam explosion pretreatment dramatically improved the apparent disappearance of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF). Steam explosion pretreatment significantly increased the molar proportion of propionate and decreased the ratio of acetate to propionate. At archaeal level, steam explosion pretreatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter, which can effectively remove metabolic hydrogen to keep the fermentation continuing. At bacterial level, the shift in fermentation was achieved by increasing the relative abundance of cellulolytic bacteria and propionate-related bacteria, including Spirochaetes, Elusimicrobia, Fibrobacteres, Prevotella, Treponema, Ruminococcus, and Fibrobacter. steam explosion; corn stover; ruminal fermentation in vitro; archaeal community; bacterial community; Microbiology; QR1-502 Frontiers in Microbiology, Vol 11 (2020) Kun Wang; Xuemei Nan; Jinjin Tong; Guangyong Zhao; Linshu Jiang; Benhai Xiong\"},{\"id\":\"1a0a3f3caa1e32233563ed82f09e817107967b9ed3006e373163cb2bcc954893\",\"content\":\"The Influence of Sieving on the Dust Explosion Characteristics of a Lignite Coal For the new developments in the area of coal-fired power plants, the flexibility is a major concern. The power plants must be able to operate with a high variety of coal qualities, with different particle size distribution, moisture content and ash content. In order to research the combustibility of different sieved fractions of lignite coal in solid fuel power plants, the explosion characteristics were investigated experimentally. The aim of this study is to determine the ignition characteristics of a dried brown coal. Different sieved fractions are researched in order to investigate the influence of particle size distribution on the ignition sensitivity and explosion severity of the coal. Different explosion characteristics are determined using standardised test apparatuses, such as the MIKE-3 apparatuses and the 20-L sphere. Following characteristics are determined: minimum ignition energy (MIE), maximum explosion pressure (Pmax), maximum rate of explosion pressure rise (dP\\/dt)max and the dust explosion constant (Kst). The behaviour of the explosion characteristics are related with the particle size distribution of the sieved fractions. Chemical engineering; TP155-156; Computer engineering.

The phenomenon of pipeline explosion was recorded, and a large amount of data on vibration effects were obtained. The data showed that the ground vibration during the explosion was mainly caused by the physical explosion process, and the subsequent gas explosion did not produce strong vibration. Based on the ANSYS\\/LS-DYNA platform, a numerical calculation model of this experiment was established. The numerical results agreed well with the experimental results. Simulation and experimental results showed that when the gas pressure in the pipe was lower than 7 MPa, the pipeline cracks stop growing. The maximum speed of the pipe wall moving outward reached 50 m\\/s, which formed a huge impact compression effect on the surrounding soil. This state spread to distant places and gradually decayed into an elastic stress wave, which formed a ground vibration effect. Time-frequency analysis was introduced into the vibration signal processing. The analysis results showed that the main frequency of pipeline explosion vibration was distributed around 10 Hz and had a long duration. The research results provided a reference for subsequent gas pipeline explosion test and numerical simulation research.

The explosion characteristics and flame propagation behavior of oil shale dust are worth studying. The difference between the multiple explosion behaviors of oil shale dust was investigated with the use of a 20 L explosive spherical tank and a dust MIE experimental device. The explosion characteristics and microstructure changes of the explosive products in multiple explosions were examined. The experimental results show that the maximum explosion pressure (Pmax) dropped, and simultaneously, the minimum ignition energy (MIE), the explosion time (t), and the maximum rate of pressure rise (dp\\/dtmax) increased as the explosions continued. Furthermore, the oil shale continued exploding until the third explosion. Some original oil shale dust (OOSD) and explosive residues were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. The SEM images of the explosive residues indicate a high fragmentation degree and well-developed pore structure during the entire multiexplosion process. Oxygen-containing functional groups, the aliphatic C-H bond, and the aromatic C-H bond in oil shale dust all participated in the oil shale dust explosion process.

[Methods] First,the reliability of the simulation method was verified by experimental data. Then the simulation model of the explosion venting cabin was established using the finite element analysis software. And the principle of thin-plate explosion venting structure was analyzed;the damage failure and load variation under different thin plate thicknesses were studied. Finally,the quadratic function model of specific impulse and deflection changing with the thickness is obtained by function fitting. [Results] The results show that the failure of the cabin first occurred at the connection between the thin plate and bulkhead,and gradually extended to the corners and edges of bulkhead;the thinner the plate,the likely an explosion venting opening is to form. When an explosion venting opening forms,the whole thin plate flies out of the cabin;the existence of the explosion venting structure has little effect on the initial shock wave overpressure,but it can effectively reduce the quasi-static pressure and specific impulse in the cabin. The main factors causing the deformation of the protective bulkhead are the initial shock wave and the reflected shock wave,and the main factor causing the ultimate damage of the protective bulkhead is the quasi-static pressure acting for a long time.

This corresponds to basic conditions for fine disintegration of biomass to lignocellulosic structure with good holocellulose accessibility. Particles obtained from fibreboard and particle board primarily consisting of softwood without steam explosion pretreatment provide relatively low cellulose accessibility for commercial enzymes activity while monosaccharides concentration is partly reduced because of torrefaction at high temperatures. The concentration of monosaccharides in hydrolysates was determined for original sample and each steam explosion temperature. Based on the steam explosion conditions, the effect of severity factors was investigated to find optimum pretreatment conditions to increase accessibility of softwood cellulose and hemicelluloses.

We propose twelve nodes to represent accident evolution and establish a Bayesian network model for chemical plant explosion accidents, combining historical data with expert experience to support the prevention, management, and real-time warning. Hypothetical scenarios and catastrophic explosion scenarios were analyzed by setting different combinations of states for nodes. Moreover, the impacts of factors such as factory type, material form, accident equipment, the emergency response on casualty and property loss are evaluated. We find that sensitivity of property loss and casualties to factory type and ongoing work are less significant; the equipment factors result in more casualties than that from personnel factors; the impact of emergency response on the accident results is significant; equipment safety management and personnel safety training are the most important measures to prevent chemical plant explosion risks. risk analysis; chemical plant explosion; bayesian network; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350 Sustainability, Vol 12, Iss 1, p 137 (2019) Rongchen Zhu; Xin Li; Xiaofeng Hu; Deshui Hu\"},{\"id\":\"b06b2761ac7fddb1addde823c7a615309967cb57f9f882118df99805da859b39\",\"content\":\"Explosion characteristics of propanol isomer-air mixtures This paper describes a series of experiments performed to study the explosion characteristics of propanol isomer (1-propanol and 2-propanol)-air binary mixtures.

The dynamic responses of these walls were evaluated under blast loading using overpressure test system, digital image correlation (DIC) full-field strain testing, and high-speed photography recording of the crushing process. Analysis of the results of the overpressure and strain tests revealed the effect of the wall height on the overpressure behind the wall. Increasing the height of the explosion-proof wall can improve the protection ratio of the wall by more than 2%. The variation of full-field strain of different materials at the same burst ratio was obtained. The engineered cementitious composite explosion-proof wall was obviously superior to that of ordinary concrete in strain control on the back-explosion surface.

By using the difference-in-differences method and the sample from the property agent, we found that the explosion event generated a long-time effect on the public and property market in the city of Tianjin. Relative to those properties far away from the explosion site, the sales price and the sale-to-list ratio of the property near the explosion site were detected to have significant drops for the first six months after the explosion event. The temporal decrease of the relative sales price and the sale-to-list ratio are the evidence of short period overreaction from the public, which decays over time.

In the presence of a sufficient amount of oxygen and an ignition source, such a situation could lead to explosion that may result in the destruction of building structures and the building in general. Strengthening the stability of supporting structures is aimed at protecting industrial premises against possible destruction by explosion indoors. One of the effective ways to protect construction structures against the excessive pressure of explosion is to use explosion venting panels. In order to solve practical tasks on protecting industrial premises and structures against explosion, one must be able to choose both the area and parameters for explosion venting panels. In addition, in order to reduce the related loads to safe quantities, it is necessary to properly calculate the bearing structures in terms of dynamic stability while maintaining their carrying capacity. The set task to ensure protection against explosion by applying explosion venting panels with flexible elements can be solved through integrated accounting for mechanical properties of cellular polycarbonate sheets. We have performed experimental research into performance of the inertia-free explosion venting panels with flexible enclosing elements exposed to dynamic loads under conditions of explosion. Based on the obtained results, the effective rigidity and critical displacement of cellular polycarbonate sheets of flexible elements have been determined.

The peculiarity of the considered oscillatory process is that as a result of the interaction of well charges with each other, the mass of a separate charge will be expressed by the effective mass, and the seismicity coefficient is a constant value for given conditions of mass explosions. The latter circumstance allows to confidently predict the seismic effect of a career explosion. For example, on the same horizon or in similar mining and geological conditions with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes. The coefficients Kc and n are interconnected by a functional dependence, which is determined on the basis of experimental studies, and later allows you to easily move from one coefficient to the values of another. All parameters included in the dependence to determine the intensity of ground oscillations in the explosion of a dispersed charge fit into the law of similarity of M.A. Sadovskyi with the explosion of chemical explosives. Using the result of experimental studies of the seismic action of short-delayed mass explosions in quarries, a technique has been developed to determine the actual number of simultaneously exploded well charges that are not provided for in the passport of a mass explosion. At the same time, in parallel with the mass explosion, the method provides for the explosion of a single borehole charge before or after the first one.

Additionally, the effect of steam explosion pretreatment technology on the canolol content of rapeseed oil was studied and the formation mechanism of canolol elucidated. The results revealed that when the steam explosion pressure reached 1.0 MPa, the canolol content of the tested oil increased from 41.21 to 2,168.69 mg\\/kg (52.63\\u2010fold increase) and that sinapic acid played a significant role in the conversion of canolol.

Using a Godbert-Greenwold (G-G) Furnace experimental device, Hartmann tube experimental device, and 20 L explosion vessel, the oil shale and coal mixed dust ignition sensitivity experiment, flame propagation experiment, and explosion characteristics experiment were carried out. The minimum ignition temperature (MIT), minimum ignition energy (MIE), maximum explosion pressure ( P max ), maximum rate of pressure rise (( dp\\/dt ) max ), and explosibility index ( K St ) parameters and the flame propagation behavior of the mixed dust were analyzed in detail. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the coal and oil shale dust before and after the explosion was carried out to study the changes in the microscopic morphology of the dust particles. The results show that due to the oil shale having a high volatile content and low moisture content, in the mixture, the greater the percentage of oil shale, the more likely the dust cloud is to be ignited and the faster the explosion flame is propagated; the greater the percentage of oil shale, the greater the ( dP\\/dt ) max and K St will be and, under a high dust concentration, a greater P max will be produced.

In this method, only the explosion energy and distance from the centre of explosion are required to find the damage by using simple predictive models in terms of empirical-type formulas. The explosion model herein is a TNO multiphysic method. This provides the maximum overpressure and pulse duration in terms of the explosion length and distance from explosion centre. Thereafter, the obtained results are combined with the SDOF model of the blast wall to determine the ductility ratio and the damage. By using advanced optimisation techniques, two types of predictive models are found. In the first model, the formula is found in terms of 2 parameters of explosion length and distance from explosion centre. However, the 2nd model has 3 parameters of explosion length, distance, and also the natural period of the blast wall. These predictive models are then used to find explosion damages and ductility ratio. The results are compared with FEM analysis and pressure-impulse (P-I) method. It is shown that both types of models fit well with the outputs of the simulation. Moreover, results of both models are close to FEM analysis. The comparison tables provided in this paper show that, in the asymptotic region of P-I diagrams, results are not accurate. Therefore, this new method is superior to classical pressure-impulse (P-I) diagrams in the literature. Advantage of the new method is the easy damage assessment by using simple empirical-type formulas. Therefore, the researchers can use the method in this paper, for damage assessment in other types of blast resistive structures. Engineering (General).

The reliability of the numerical models was verified on the basis of the explosion experiments. According to the amount of gas leakage, the TNT explosive equivalent was determined. The gas leakage explosion process of buried PE pipes was studied, and the pressure and stress changes of pipes and pavements under different explosive equivalents and buried depths were analyzed; at last, the deformation law of pipes and pavements were discussed. The results show that the PE pipes are fractured during the leakage explosion and a spherical explosion cavity is formed in the soil. The pavement above the explosion point bulges upward and forms a circle. The maximum pressure of pipe near the explosion point increases linearly with the increase of explosive equivalent, and a proportional relation is observed between the fracture width of pipe and the explosive equivalent. The degree and duration of pavement deformation increase significantly with the increase of explosive equivalents. The dynamic response of the pipes is rarely affected by the buried depth, and the change of maximum effective stress is no more than 7%. However, the buried depth is of great influence on the damage degree of pavement. When the buried depth increases from 0.9 m to 1.5 m, the pavement deformation can be reduced effectively. The variation rule of pavement deformation is similar to the change rule of maximum overpressure and effective plastic stress; they change in the form of concave functions with the increase of buried depth. The results can provide theoretical basis for municipal pipeline construction design and urban safety planning and provide references for the risk assessment of gas explosion in buried pipelines.

For this purpose, 32 samples of coal with different moisture content were collected from different mines in Iran and were prepared as coal rounds. The coal dust explosion process was carried out in a 2-litre closed chamber. After determining the most important and influential parameters, prediction models of the explosion index were presented using linear regression.

While the ability of dust explosions to propagate is widely recognized, some misconceptions still exist. One of the common myths is that a dust explosion cannot propagate through small diameter pipes and that explosion isolation may not be required in that case. This article first presents a simplified theory of flame propagation in pipes. Dust explosion experiments performed in industrial-scale pipes smaller or equal to 4 in (or 100 mm) in diameter are then reviewed.

In this study, the researcher observes the cost of explosion used by PT Vitrama Properti in its mining of granites. According to the economic analysis, to determine the cost of explosion need to count on the breakeven point. The method employed in this research is to analyze the breakeven point. Breakeven point is a calculation used to know the volume of explosion rate so that the total income and total cost will be at the breakeven point. The data collection is conducted from December 2016 to February 2017, including the data of drilling cost, explosion usage cost, the salary of employees and contract employees, excavators and dump trucks fuel cost, equipment ownership cost, and the specification of explosion tools and equipment. The result of the data analysis shows that the total explosion cost paid by PT Vitrama Properti in January 2017 is Rp.1,041,936,063,00 and the total income earned is Rp.1,287,134,940.00, so the total profit made is Rp.245,198,976.00. Whereas, the breakeven point of PT Vitrama Properti in January 2017 is on the explosion volume rate of 23,109.08 m3 with the total earning and total cost is Rp.841,170,781.00. One of the significant factors to reduce the cost of explosion is to improve the geometry of explosion and to make the effective use of ANFO. After implementing the improved geometry of the explosion, the breakeven point is also improved from the volume rate of 23,109.08 m3 to the volume rate of 21,090.35 m3. Also, to increase the income from the explosion process can be done by increasing the sale of granite from the explosion (boulder) into 7,072.17 m3 with the total income of Rp.257,426,988.00, as well as by increasing the total product sale of 24,752.59 m3 with the total income obtained of Rp.900,994,458.00.

Aluminium, magnesium, titanium, iron and zinc were considered and their explosion safety parameters were analysed as a function of their mean primary particle size either determined by BET measurements, particle size distribution. To depict the course of explosion behaviour for these metals, extensive literature review has been performed and additional experimental tests were also performed. Generally, decreasing the particle size in a metallic powder leads to a higher explosion severity. It appears that this statement is true till a critical Diameter below which the explosion severity (pmax, dp\\/dtmax) decreases for all the considered powders. This critical size can be explained by theoretical considerations on the nature of thermal transfer in the flame, namely by analysing the Cassel model. Finally, semi-empirical models were also developed for aluminium to highlight the specific micrometre and nanometre behaviour and the influence of turbulence, particle burning time, Diameter and concentration. The influence of these key parameters needs to be further assessed in a future work in order to better understand the mechanisms involved and to extend the scope to other powdered materials. ddc:624  Krietsch, Arne; Vignes, A.; Dufaud, O.; Santandr\\u00e9a, A.; Perrin, L.; Bouillard, J.\"},{\"id\":\"cd0e7924beeec0df8a4363a7d8702cb24cddc9370a8e47264d494fc63baaf020\",\"content\":\"Influence of initial temperature and pressure on the explosion behavior of n-dodecane\\/air mixtures There is an increasing industrial interest towards long-chain hydrocarbons, also due to the fact that they can be obtained from renewable organic materials. These substances are flammable and, under certain conditions, can explode. Nevertheless, very few experimental data are available on their thermal and kinetic characteristics and, more specifically, on their flammability and explosion behavior under various process conditions. In the work presented in this paper, the explosion behavior of n-dodecane has been investigated through experiments performed in a closed 5-l cylindrical vessel by varying the concentration of (vaporized) fuel in air at different initial temperatures - 130 \\u00b0C and 160 \\u00b0C - and pressures - 1, 2 and 3 bar. From the recorded pressure-time histories, the most important parameters for the assessment of process hazards and the safe design of process equipment - maximum pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, and deflagration index - have been quantified. It has been found that, prior to feeding air and igniting the fuel\\/air mixture, the n-dodecane injected into the explosion vessel undergoes pyrolysis phenomena that interfere with combustion, thus affecting the performed measurements. On the basis of these results, it can be expected that pyrolysis also affects the flammability and explosion behavior of long-chain hydrocarbons others than n-dodecane involved in industrial processes at high temperature and, thus, it should be taken into consideration when addressing safety-related issues. \\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd Closed-vessel explosion; Deflagration index; Initial conditions; Maximum pressure; n-Dodecane; Pyrolysis  Cammarota, F.; Di Benedetto, A.; Di Sarli, V.; Salzano, E.\"},{\"id\":\"4ba273776d8284405d4978e310cc57ebce02229d96edc659bfaa15dc182e7340\",\"content\":\"Crankcase explosion for two-stroke marine diesel engine by using fault tree analysis method in fuzzy environment WOS: 000456719900023 ; The purpose of this study is to investigate crankcase explosion in two-stroke marine diesel engine systematically by using fault tree analysis method in fuzzy environment for system reliability and shipping sustainability.

The effect of pipe length on combustible gas explosion and the influence of explosion shock wave on thin-walled pipe loading were also studied. The experimental device included photoelectric, pressure, and strain sensors which were used to evaluate the explosion parameters and stress of the thin-walled pipe. The result was that the longer the pipeline, the higher the wall overpressure and the bigger the maximum tube wall. The pressure time curve was consistent with the thin-walled strain time\\u2013history curve. The pipe bend accelerates the flame propagation to a certain extent, and the pipe length influenced the law of flame ignition and explosion in pipe integrally; the longer the pipe, the greater the pressure and the speed of the flame. The maximum explosion pressure appears at the end of the pipe, and the loading of the shock wave on pipe wall belongs to dynamic response.

To prevent disastrous damages, the Task Committee on Design of Blast Resistant Buildings in Petrochemical Facilities of the ASCE suggested several empirical methods to determine gas explosion blast loads for the structural design of petrochemical facilities. However, the procedures for determining overpressure from gas explosion are not easy for practicing engineers to follow, due to the complexity of gas explosion mechanisms and numerous affecting factors. In addition, the blast loads are greatly influenced by the class or Mach number in the empirical methods, but high uncertainty exists in selecting a reasonable class or Mach number for preliminary design. In an effort to reduce the difficulty and ambiguity, this study provides a thorough review and comparative analysis of the empirical methods suggested by ASCE for determining overpressure from gas explosion. In addition, this paper presents a case study that demonstrates the determination of blast loads in accordance with the ASCE guidelines.

Confidence in event screening can be increased if multiple independent approaches are used. We describe a new approach to event screening using the seismic moment tensor and its representation on the hypersphere, specifically the 5-sphere of 6-degree unit vectors representing the normalized symmetric moment tensor. The sample of moment tensors from an explosion data set is unimodal on the 5-sphere and can be parametrized by the Langevin distribution, which is sometimes referred to as the Normal distribution on the hypersphere. Screening is then accomplished by finding the angle from the explosion population mean to any newly measured moment tensor and testing if that angle is in the tail of the Langevin distribution (conservatively quantified as greater than 99.9 per cent of the cumulative density). We apply the screen to a sample of earthquakes from the Western USA and the September 2017 explosion and subsequent collapse at the Pungyye-Ri Test Site in North Korea.

In this study, a numerical model of gas explosion in a residential building was developed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The numerical simulations were performed for different gas cloud filling regions and equivalence ratios to identify the initial scenario, and the simulation results were compared with the real consequences of gas explosion. Additionally, the temporal and spatial evolvement characteristics of explosion overpressure and indoor temperature were analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of vent area ratio and the activation pressure of vent panels in the kitchen were investigated to propose effective mitigation measures for the gas explosions inside residential buildings. The results show that the simulation results reproduced by the CFD model are in good agreement with the real accident consequences. During the explosion process, the overpressure distribution in a room is almost uniform at the same moment and there exists little spatial difference. The maximum temperature can reach up to 1953\\u00b0C, which can cause secondary fire accidents easily. The maximum flame speed is in the range of 34.3 m\\/s and 230.9 m\\/s. It indicates that gas explosion inside residential buildings is a typical deflagration process. When the vent area ratio is less than 0.3, the overpressure peaks decrease rapidly with the increase of the vent area ratio. However, when the vent area ratio is larger than 0.3, the overpressure peaks are almost independent on the vent area ratio. There is a proportional relationship between the overpressure peaks and the activation pressure of vent panels. These achievements provide reliable reference data for the accident investigation of gas explosion and subsequent treatment.

This study demonstrates an indirect method to estimate the perceived risk of the general public and provides valuable insight into sustainable port management policies. ; Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies ; 202006 bcrc ; published_final Tianjin port explosion; Risk perception; Property value; Difference-in-differences; The housing market  Huang, Y; Yip, TL; Liang, C\"},{\"id\":\"d7fe606757dc844773610bee86aad8fa4617d2ad41c92c49ef487449dd3241c5\",\"content\":\"Experimental Investigation of the Impact of CO, C\\u2082H\\u2086, and H\\u2082 on the Explosion Characteristics of CH\\u2084 Gas explosions are destructive disasters in coal mines.

In general, the explosion-energy evolution is monotonic and relatively smooth, suggesting a possible analytic solution. We derive analytic solutions for the expansion of the gain region under the following assumptions: spherical symmetry, one-zone shell, and powered by neutrinos and \\u03b1 particle recombination. We consider two hypotheses: (I) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos and \\u03b1 recombination and (II) explosion energy is powered by neutrinos alone. Under these assumptions, we derive the fundamental dimensionless parameters and analytic scalings. For the neutrino-only hypothesis (II), the asymptotic explosion energy scales as $E_{\\\\infty } \\\\approx 1.5 M_\\\\mathrm{ g} u _0^2 \\\\eta ^{2\\/3}$, where Mg is the gain mass, $ u _0$ is the free-fall velocity at the shock, and \\u03b7 is a ratio of the heating and dynamical time-scales. Including both neutrinos and recombination (hypothesis I), the asymptotic explosion energy is $E_{\\\\infty } \\\\approx M_g u _0^2 (1.5\\\\eta ^{2\\/3} + \\\\beta f(\\\\rho _0))$, where \\u03b2 is the dimensionless recombination parameter. We use Bayesian inference to fit these analytic models to simulations. Both hypotheses fit the simulations of the lowest progenitor masses that tend to explode spherically. The fits do not prefer hypothesis I or II; however, prior investigations suggest that \\u03b1 recombination is important. As expected, neither hypothesis fits the higher mass simulations that exhibit aspherical explosions. In summary, this explosion energy theory is consistent with the spherical explosions of low progenitor masses; the inconsistency with higher progenitor-mass simulations suggests that a theory for them must include aspherical dynamics.

The phenomenon of pipeline explosion was recorded, and a large amount of data on vibration effects were obtained. The data showed that the ground vibration during the explosion was mainly caused by the physical explosion process, and the subsequent gas explosion did not produce strong vibration. Based on the ANSYS\\/LS-DYNA platform, a numerical calculation model of this experiment was established. The numerical results agreed well with the experimental results. Simulation and experimental results showed that when the gas pressure in the pipe was lower than 7 MPa, the pipeline cracks stop growing. The maximum speed of the pipe wall moving outward reached 50 m\\/s, which formed a huge impact compression effect on the surrounding soil. This state spread to distant places and gradually decayed into an elastic stress wave, which formed a ground vibration effect. Time-frequency analysis was introduced into the vibration signal processing. The analysis results showed that the main frequency of pipeline explosion vibration was distributed around 10 Hz and had a long duration. The research results provided a reference for subsequent gas pipeline explosion test and numerical simulation research.

This requires a sample of waveforms from modern 3D supernova simulations reaching well into the explosion phase, where gravitational wave emission is expected to peak. However, recent waveforms from 3D simulations with multigroup neutrino transport do not reach far into the explosion phase, and some are still obtained from non-exploding models. We therefore calculate waveforms up to 0.9 s after bounce using the neutrino hydrodynamics code COCONUT-FMT. We consider two models with low and normal explosion energy, namely explosions of an ultra-stripped progenitor with an initial helium star mass of 3.5 M-circle dot, and of an 18 M-circle dot single star. Both models show gravitational wave emission from the excitation of surface g modes in the proto-neutron star with frequencies between similar to 800 and 1000 Hz at peak emission. The peak amplitudes are about 6 and 10 cm, respectively, which is somewhat higher than in most recent 3D models of the pre-explosion or early explosion phase. Using a Bayesian analysis, we determine the maximum detection distances for our models in simulated Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and Einstein Telescope (ET) design sensitivity noise. The more energetic 18 M-circle dot explosion will be detectable to about 17.5 kpc by the LIGO\\/Virgo network and to about 180 kpc with the ET.

The explosion pressure characteristics were closely related to the coal dust particle size and concentration. The maximum explosion pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, and deflagration index for nano-sized coal dust were larger than for its micro-sized counterpart, indicating that a nano-sized coal dust explosion is more dangerous. The highest deflagration index K st for coal dust was 13.97 MPa\\/(m\\u00b7s), indicating weak explosibility. When 7% methane was added to the air, the maximum deflagration index K st for methane\\u2013coal dust was 42.62 MPa\\/(m\\u00b7s), indicating very strong explosibility.

In this study, a numerical model of gas explosion in a residential building was developed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The numerical simulations were performed for different gas cloud filling regions and equivalence ratios to identify the initial scenario, and the simulation results were compared with the real consequences of gas explosion. Additionally, the temporal and spatial evolvement characteristics of explosion overpressure and indoor temperature were analyzed. Furthermore, the effects of vent area ratio and the activation pressure of vent panels in the kitchen were investigated to propose effective mitigation measures for the gas explosions inside residential buildings. The results show that the simulation results reproduced by the CFD model are in good agreement with the real accident consequences. During the explosion process, the overpressure distribution in a room is almost uniform at the same moment and there exists little spatial difference. The maximum temperature can reach up to 1953\\u00b0C, which can cause secondary fire accidents easily. The maximum flame speed is in the range of 34.3 m\\/s and 230.9 m\\/s. It indicates that gas explosion inside residential buildings is a typical deflagration process. When the vent area ratio is less than 0.3, the overpressure peaks decrease rapidly with the increase of the vent area ratio. However, when the vent area ratio is larger than 0.3, the overpressure peaks are almost independent on the vent area ratio. There is a proportional relationship between the overpressure peaks and the activation pressure of vent panels. These achievements provide reliable reference data for the accident investigation of gas explosion and subsequent treatment. Engineering (General).

Our main conclusion is that in the frame of the jittering jets explosion mechanism the remnant of a pulsar in these low-energy CCSNe has some significance, in that the launching of jets by the newly born neutron star (NS) spins-up the NS and create a pulsar. We crudely estimated the period of the pulsars to be tens of milliseconds in these cases.

Studies have shown that the standard procedures and equipment applied to spherical particles suffer from many issues: control of the turbulence level, non-uniform dust dispersion, and particle fragmentation due to the injection system. The applicability of the standard procedures and equipment to non-spherical particles is still an open issue. In this work, we have investigated, via CFD simulations, the distribution of turbulence and dust concentration in the standard 20 l spherical vessel for non-spherical particles. Results have shown that a higher turbulence level and a higher amount of dust actually fed into the vessel are reached with respect to spherical particles.

Upper and lower bounds for the explosion time are established, as well as an algorithm to compute the explosion time (under some restrictions). We show that the critical moments are finite for all maturities. For negative correlation, we apply our algorithm for the moment explosion time to compute the lower critical moment.

Blast walls are generally used for the purpose of reducing the explosion consequences. This study introduce a new concept of blast wall (perforated blast wall) which can disrupt loaindg pressure during the explosion. A dynamic finite element analysis was performed to investigate the effects of the geometric characteristics on the performance of perforated blast walls. A series of computations were performed varying with opening size, plate thickness and opening layout associated with Blockage Ratio. A proposal formula was derived as a function of those design parameters for easily expecting the dynamic structural response characteristics.

In this paper, the coupled Eulerian\\u2013Lagrangian (CEL) method in AUTODYN is used to simulate the process of shock wave propagation and solve FSI problems. Firstly, the governing equation and the treatment of fluid and structure interface of the CEL method are briefly reviewed. Afterwards, two underwater explosion numerical models are established, and the results are compared with the empirical formula and experimental data, respectively, to verify the reliability of numerical solutions. The results obtained by this method show good agreements with those of the empirical formula and experiment. Furthermore, the model of the multilayer structures composed of two hemispherical shells and the fluid filled between the shells subjected to underwater explosion is established, and the pressure characteristics of the shock wave propagating across the multilayer structures are analyzed regarding the wave reflection and transmission. Finally, the effects of the shell thickness and the filled fluid type among the multilayer structures on the wave reflection and transmission are studied.
