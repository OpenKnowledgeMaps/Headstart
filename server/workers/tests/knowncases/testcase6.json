Design Serial cross sectional analysis of cause specific heart disease mortality rates using national death certificate data in the overall population as well as stratified by race-sex, age, and geography. Setting United States, 1999-2018. Participants 12.9 million decedents from total heart disease (49% women, 12% black, and 19% &lt;65 years old). Main outcome measures Age adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) and years of potential life lost (YPLL) for each heart disease subtype, and respective mean annual percentage change. Results Deaths from total heart disease fell from 752 192 to 596 577 between 1999 and 2011, and then increased to 655 381 in 2018. From 1999 to 2018, the proportion of total deaths from heart disease attributed to ischemic heart disease decreased from 73% to 56%, while the proportion attributed to heart failure increased from 8% to 13% and the proportion attributed to hypertensive heart disease increased from 4% to 9%. Among heart disease subtypes, AAMR was consistently highest for ischemic heart disease in all subgroups (race-sex, age, and region). After 2011, AAMR for heart failure and hypertensive heart disease increased at a faster rate than for other subtypes. The fastest increases in heart failure mortality were in black men (mean annual percentage change 4.9%, 95% confidence interval 4.0% to 5.8%), whereas the fastest increases in hypertensive heart disease occurred in white men (6.3%, 4.9% to 9.4%). The burden of years of potential life lost was greatest from ischemic heart disease, but black-white disparities were driven by heart failure and hypertensive heart disease. Deaths from heart disease in 2018 resulted in approximately 3.8 million potential years of life lost. Conclusions Trends in AAMR and years of potential life lost for ischemic heart disease have decelerated since 2011. For almost all other subtypes of heart disease, AAMR and years of potential life lost became stagnant or increased. Heart failure and hypertensive heart disease account for the greatest increases in premature deaths and the largest black-white disparities and have offset declines in ischemic heart disease. Early and targeted primary and secondary prevention and control of risk factors for heart disease, with a focus on groups at high risk, are needed to avoid these suboptimal trends beginning earlier in life.\",\"published_in\":\"BMJ ; page m2688 ; ISSN 1756-1833\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Shah, Nilay S; Molsberry, Rebecca; Rana, Jamal S; Sidney, Stephen; Capewell, Simon; O\\u2019Flaherty, Martin; Carnethon, Mercedes; Lloyd-Jones, Donald M; Khan, Sadiya S\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1136\\/bmj.m2688\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"e8f665f010531f3cafcd31b31d22ed0d0877faa263036a416c5d15cfac5eb7fe\",\"relevance\":120,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1136\\/bmj.m2688\"},{\"id\":\"327a35e12f6d776ce3694a88c68dbc9204eca1f20f727feb8cf44de7d18d3512\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.worc.ac.uk\\/8658\\/1\\/care%20of%20infants%20children%20and%20adults%20with%20congenital%20heart%20disease.pdf; http:\\/\\/eprints.worc.ac.uk\\/8658\\/7\\/key_issues_in_the-care-of-children-with-cover.pdf; Gaskin, Kerry and Kennedy, F.

We suggest that cardiovascular risk factors should be assessed systematically in individuals with obstructive airway disease with the potential to facilitate targeted treatments.\",\"published_in\":\"BMJ Open Respiratory Research, Vol 7, Iss 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medicine; R; Diseases of the respiratory system; RC705-779\",\"subject\":\"Medicine; R; Diseases of the respiratory system; \",\"authors\":\"Truls Sylvan Ingebrigtsen; Jacob Louis Marott; Peter Lange\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1136\\/bmjresp-2019-000470\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"998504bdde3cff1b53b88bfce2693ad81bb688bfaf7603033dbf7dbd8e0a5813\",\"relevance\":113,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1136\\/bmjresp-2019-000470\"},{\"id\":\"6854d5fc22852066c37d0ffbd1a27a6b3dff9e54307623696cd5418cb0d8a035\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/centerprode.com\\/ojss\\/ojss0302\\/coas.ojss.0302.02045n.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2560-5283; doi:10.32591\\/coas.ojss.0302.02045n; 2560-5283; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/48e8d9f783d84de38b30ce70e74e39a2\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.32591\\/coas.ojss.0302.02045n; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/48e8d9f783d84de38b30ce70e74e39a2\",\"title\":\"Social Support Among Heart Disease Patients: A Critical Review of Literature\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The aim of this paper was to critically review literature regarding the social support among heart disease patients. Social support has been prospectively associated with prognosis among heart disease patients. Psychosocial factors such as depression and low social support are established risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with heart disease. Patients living with heart disease who receive proper social support have a better prognosis than those who do not have this support. This is a qualitative meta synthesis study. Thus, literature on social support among heart disease patients were searched and reviewed. Information about the available social support, beneficial supportive actions, social support factors contributing to heart disease, and social support challenges faced by heart disease patients were identified and discussed. The paper concludes that information regarding social support available to heart disease patients, supportive actions beneficial to heart disease patients, social support factors contributing to heart disease and social support challenges faced by heart disease patients is paramount for the development of a clinical assessment tool and support model for heart disease patients; and recommends that identified information should be used to develop a clinical assessment tool to obtain baseline social support information from every heart disease patient, to inform effective social support interventions.\",\"published_in\":\"Open Journal for Sociological Studies, Vol 3, Iss 2, Pp 45-52 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"social support; heart disease; available support; challenges; support factors; Sociology (General); HM401-1281\",\"subject\":\"social support; heart disease; available support; challenges; support factors; \",\"authors\":\"Phillip Nhlanhla\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.32591\\/coas.ojss.0302.02045n\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"6854d5fc22852066c37d0ffbd1a27a6b3dff9e54307623696cd5418cb0d8a035\",\"relevance\":112,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.32591\\/coas.ojss.0302.02045n\"},{\"id\":\"908ed79be7c5c2501f06412f249d8a05be19b6fa77aa3f32081a2e49657bcffd\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/crinn.conferencehunter.com\\/index.php\\/jcrinn\\/article\\/view\\/122; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2600-8793; 2600-8793; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/40971f2856bc427691b45f724d6b8331\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/40971f2856bc427691b45f724d6b8331\",\"title\":\"Towards Designing A Hierarchical Fuzzy System for Early Diagnosis of Heart Disease\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Heart disease may represent a range of conditions that affect our heart. Disease under heart diseases umbrella include coronary heart disease, heart attack, congestive heart failure, and congenital heart disease, is the leading cause of death. Moreover, heart disease not only attacks the elderly. In the present day, lots of younger people might be getting affected by the number of heart diseases. In order to decrease the mortality rate caused by heart disease, it is necessary for the disease, to be diagnosed at an early stage. In this paper, we have proposed the use of hierarchical fuzzy systems (HFSs) for early diagnosis of heart disease. However, to design the HFSs is challenging, especially for the complex system. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on designing a hierarchical fuzzy system to handle the complex medical application. The designed HFS consists of six key main steps implemented on heart disease. The input variables of heart disease includes shortness of breath, discomfort, pressure, heaviness, or pain in the chest, arm, or below the breastbone, fatigue, nausea, difficulties in climbing stairs, swelling in ankles, difficulty to sleep at night, irregular heartbeats, fullness, sweating, take frequent break during the day, dizzy and depressed. Additionally, the output of heart disease is to classify whether the patient is healthy or suspecting with heart disease. The study contributes to providing insight into a way of designing the HFSs, particularly for the complex medical application.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Computing Research and Innovation, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 31-41 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Probabilities.

Design A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background Growing evidence suggests a relationship between occupational silica exposure and heart disease; however, the link between them is less clear. Data sources PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer and EMBASE were searched for articles published between 1 January 1995 and 20 June 2019. Articles that investigated the effects of occupational silica exposure on the risk of heart disease were considered. Study selection We included cohort studies, including prospective, retrospective and retroprospective studies. Data extraction and synthesis We extracted data using a piloted data collection form and conducted random-effects meta-analysis and exposure-response analysis. The meta-relative risk (meta-RR), a measure of the average ratio of heart disease rates in those with and without silica exposure, was used as an inverse variance-weighted average of relative risks from the individual studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies was used for study quality assessment. Outcome measure We calculated the risk of heart diseases such as pulmonary heart disease, ischaemic heart disease and others. Results Twenty cohort studies were included. The results suggest a significant increase in the risk of overall heart disease (meta-RR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.13). Stronger evidence of association with pulmonary heart disease was found in the risk estimate of both categories of heart disease (meta-RR=1.24, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.43) and in the exposure-response analysis (meta-RR=1.39, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.62). Our subgroup analyses also revealed that the statistical heterogeneity among studies could be attributed mainly to the diversity in reference group, occupation and study quality score. Conclusions Silica-exposed workers are at an increased risk for overall heart disease, especially pulmonary heart disease. Further research is needed to better clarify the relationship between occupational silica exposure and ischaemic heart disease.

Ischemic heart disease is one of the most frequent causes of heart failure and it is normally attributed to coronary artery disease, defined by the presence of one or more obstructive plaques, which determine a reduced coronary blood flow, causing myocardial ischemia and consequent heart failure. However, coronary obstruction is only an element of a complex pathophysiological process that leads to myocardial ischemia. In the literature, attention paid to the role of microcirculation, in the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and heart failure, is growing. Coronary microvascular dysfunction determines an inability of coronary circulation to satisfy myocardial metabolic demands, due to the imbalance of coronary blood flow regulatory mechanisms, including ion channels, leading to the development of hypoxia, fibrosis and tissue death, which may determine a loss of myocardial function, even beyond the presence of atherosclerotic epicardial plaques.

The underlying mechanisms, however, remain uncertain. AIMS: To examine the association between cyanotic congenital heart disease and internalising problems and assess whether parenting stress mediates this association. METHOD: The study sample was 699 children and adolescents (aged 2-17 years) with congenital heart disease (253 with cyanotic congenital heart disease and 446 with acyanotic congenital heart disease) in Taiwan. The Child Behavior Checklist and the Parenting Stress Index were used to assess internalising problems and parenting stress, respectively. A series of multiple regression models was conducted using the SPSS PROCESS procedure to test the association between types of congenital heart disease and internalising problems and the mediating role of parenting stress. A bootstrapping approach was applied to determine the significance of mediation. RESULTS: Compared with acyanotic congenital heart disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease was associated with increased levels of internalising problems (B=2.52, P<0.01), and this association was mediated by parenting stress (B=0.97, 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval 0.24, 1.75). In particular, parents of children with cyanotic congenital heart disease reported significantly more parenting stress compared with parents of children with acyanotic congenital heart disease (B=4.63, P<0.01), which contributed to elevated levels of internalising problems in the offspring (B=0.21, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Cyanotic congenital heart disease conferred risks for internalising problems in children and adolescents, and this association was mediated by parenting stress. Interventions to decrease internalising problems in children and adolescents with cyanotic congenital heart disease may be more effective by targeting parenting stress.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-04\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Chang, LY;Chiu, SN;Wang, CC;Weng, WC;Chang, HY\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.nhri.org.tw\\/handle\\/3990099045\\/12236\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"9e9610e283c943ba720b36afe19c236dc4d21786fdd2a4249e4391aaf483c8ea\",\"relevance\":103,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2eb744a24c50296f84e9aeae0f761c8ac84c9bca4a28dcf80970c896c621cb56\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/pmid\\/31978374; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/wos\\/WOS:000514855100014; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/hdl\\/10281\\/260618; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10281\\/260618; doi:10.1016\\/S2352-4642(19)30402-X; 2-s2.0-85079540364; https:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S235246421930402X?via=ihub\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10281\\/260618; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/S2352-4642(19)30402-X; https:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S235246421930402X?via=ihub\",\"title\":\"Global, regional, and national burden of congenital heart disease, 1990\\u20132017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: Previous congenital heart disease estimates came from few data sources, were geographically narrow, and did not evaluate congenital heart disease throughout the life course. Completed as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017, this study aimed to provide comprehensive estimates of congenital heart disease mortality, prevalence, and disability by age for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Methods: Mortality estimates were generated for aggregate congenital heart disease and non-fatal estimates for five subcategories (single ventricle and single ventricle pathway congenital heart anomalies; severe congenital heart anomalies excluding single ventricle heart defects; critical malformations of great vessels, congenital valvular heart disease, and patent ductus arteriosus; ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect; and other congenital heart anomalies), for 1990 through to 2017. All available global data were systematically analysed to generate congenital heart disease mortality estimates (using Cause of Death Ensemble modelling) and prevalence estimates (DisMod-MR 2\\u00b71). Systematic literature reviews of all types of congenital anomalies to capture information on prevalence, associated mortality, and long-term health outcomes on congenital heart disease informed subsequent disability estimates. Findings: Congenital heart disease caused 261 247 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 216 567\\u2013308 159) globally in 2017, a 34\\u00b75% decline from 1990, with 180 624 deaths (146 825\\u2013214 178) being among infants (aged <1 years). Congenital heart disease mortality rates declined with increasing Socio-demographic Index (SDI); most deaths occurred in countries in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. The prevalence rates of congenital heart disease at birth changed little temporally or by SDI, resulting in 11 998 283 (10 958 658\\u201313 123 888) people living with congenital heart disease globally, an 18\\u00b77% increase from 1990 to 2017, and causing a total of 589 479 (287 200\\u2013973 359) years lived with disability. Interpretation: Congenital heart disease is a large, rapidly emerging global problem in child health. Without the ability to substantially alter the prevalence of congenital heart disease, interventions and resources must be used to improve survival and quality of life. Our findings highlight the large global inequities in congenital heart disease and can serve as a starting point for policy changes to improve screening, treatment, and data collection.

However, the impact of this reactivation on the genome-wide regulatory landscape in heart disease has remained obscure. Here we show that pervasive epigenomic changes occur in heart disease, with thousands of regulatory sequences reacquiring fetal-like chromatin signatures. We used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq targeting a histone modification associated with active transcriptional enhancers to generate genome-wide enhancer maps from left ventricle tissue from 18 healthy controls and 18 individuals with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Healthy individuals had a highly reproducible epigenomic landscape, consisting of more than 31,000 predicted heart enhancers. In contrast, we observed reproducible disease-associated gains or losses of activity at more than 7,500 predicted heart enhancers. Next, we profiled human fetal heart tissue by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. Comparison with adult tissues revealed that the heart disease epigenome and transcrip-tome both shift toward a fetal-like state, with 3,400 individual enhancers sharing fetal regulatory properties. Our results demonstrate widespread epigenomic changes in DCM, and we provide a comprehensive data resource ( http:\\/\\/heart.lbl.gov ) for the mechanistic exploration of heart disease etiology.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-04-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Spurrell, Cailyn; Barozzi, Iros; Mannion, Brandon; Blow, Matthew; Fukuda-Yuzawa, Yoko; Afzal, Sarah; Akiyama, Jennifer; Afzal, Veena; Tran, Stella; Plajzer-Frick, Ingrid; Novak, Catherine; Kato, Momoe; Lee, Elizabeth; Garvin, Tyler; Pham, Quan; Harrington, Anne; Lisgo, Steven; Bristow, James; Cappola, Thomas; Morley, Michael; Margulies, Kenneth; Pennacchio, Len; Dickel, Diane; Visel, Axel\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/escholarship.org\\/uc\\/item\\/1b18p0b8\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"828c88bfdb68c936e6440402b67c33e9c8167781aae2d19c6e98ba77a3bb54c2\",\"relevance\":101,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"0b72d9b795fd1f9300bca1624df0770d43e78862afe47071fdbbc6594b6fa6a4\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2078-2489\\/11\\/4\\/207; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2078-2489; doi:10.3390\\/info11040207; 2078-2489; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e651badb5fe045918083613607f043cb\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/info11040207; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e651badb5fe045918083613607f043cb\",\"title\":\"Ensemble Deep Learning Models for Heart Disease Classification: A Case Study from Mexico\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Heart diseases are highly ranked among the leading causes of mortality in the world. They have various types including vascular, ischemic, and hypertensive heart disease. A large number of medical features are reported for patients in the Electronic Health Records (EHR) that allow physicians to diagnose and monitor heart disease. We collected a dataset from Medica Norte Hospital in Mexico that includes 800 records and 141 indicators such as age, weight, glucose, blood pressure rate, and clinical symptoms. Distribution of the collected records is very unbalanced on the different types of heart disease, where 17% of records have hypertensive heart disease, 16% of records have ischemic heart disease, 7% of records have mixed heart disease, and 8% of records have valvular heart disease. Herein, we propose an ensemble-learning framework of different neural network models, and a method of aggregating random under-sampling. To improve the performance of the classification algorithms, we implement a data preprocessing step with features selection. Experiments were conducted with unidirectional and bidirectional neural network models and results showed that an ensemble classifier with a BiLSTM or BiGRU model with a CNN model had the best classification performance with accuracy and F1-score between 91% and 96% for the different types of heart disease. These results are competitive and promising for heart disease dataset. We showed that ensemble-learning framework based on deep models could overcome the problem of classifying an unbalanced heart disease dataset. Our proposed framework can lead to highly accurate models that are adapted for clinical real data and diagnosis use.\",\"published_in\":\"Information, Vol 11, Iss 207, p 207 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"heart disease classification; neural network; ensemble-learning model; under-sampling; features selection; deep learning; Information technology; T58.5-58.64\",\"subject\":\"heart disease classification; neural network; ensemble-learning model; under-sampling; features selection; deep learning; Information technology;; 5-\",\"authors\":\"Asma Baccouche; Begonya Garcia-Zapirain; Cristian Castillo Olea; Adel Elmaghraby\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/info11040207\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"0b72d9b795fd1f9300bca1624df0770d43e78862afe47071fdbbc6594b6fa6a4\",\"relevance\":100,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/info11040207\"},{\"id\":\"3e260bb6ff71cf22ec6e6e648610ce8718b6deaeb8777f49b80475ef8c19b439\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s41687-019-0165-7; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2509-8020; doi:10.1186\\/s41687-019-0165-7; 2509-8020; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b1d6c7e95b9e4e52af90e3fdf4ca1e8c\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s41687-019-0165-7; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b1d6c7e95b9e4e52af90e3fdf4ca1e8c\",\"title\":\"A scoping review and mapping exercise comparing the content of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) across heart disease-specific scales\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Over the past decade, the importance of person-centered care has led to increased interest in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). In cardiovascular care, selecting an appropriate PROM for clinical use or research is challenging because multimorbidity is often common in patients. The aim was therefore to provide an overview of heart-disease specific PROMs and to compare the content of those outcomes using a bio-psycho-social framework of health. Methods A scoping review of heart disease-specific PROMs, including arrhythmia\\/atrial fibrillation, congenital heart disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and valve diseases was conducted in PubMed (January 2018). All items contained in the disease-specific PROMs were mapped to WHO\\u2019s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) according to standardized linking rules. Results A total of 34 PROMs (heart diseases in general n = 5; cardiac arrhythmia n = 6; heart failure n = 14; ischemic heart disease n = 9) and 147 ICF categories were identified. ICF categories covered Body functions (n = 61), Activities & Participation (n = 69), and Environmental factors (n = 17). Most items were about experienced problems of Body functions and less often about patients\\u2019 daily activities, and most PROMs were specifically developed for heart failure and no PROM were identified for valve disease or congenital heart disease. Conclusions Our results motivate and provide information to develop comprehensive PROMs that consider activity and participation by patients with various types of heart disease.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes, Vol 4, Iss 1, Pp 1-10 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"International Classification of Functioning; Disability and Health; Heart disease; Healthcare quality; Patient outcome assessment; Patient-reported outcome measures; Person-centered; Review; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"International Classification of Functioning; Disability and Health; Heart disease; Healthcare quality; Patient outcome assessment; Patient-reported outcome measures; Person-centered; Review; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Beatrix Algur\\u00e9n; Michaela Coenen; Dan Malm; Bengt Fridlund; Jan M\\u00e5rtensson; Kristofer \\u00c5restedt; on behalf of the Collaboration and Exchange in Swedish cardiovascular caring Academic Research (CESAR) group\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s41687-019-0165-7\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"3e260bb6ff71cf22ec6e6e648610ce8718b6deaeb8777f49b80475ef8c19b439\",\"relevance\":99,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s41687-019-0165-7\"},{\"id\":\"dc0ebc15cbe0a875e77080198d12408a34087ee618a9ca5263fe73623ce4558d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.dovepress.com\\/correlation-between-risk-or-severity-of-heart-failure-and-outcome-of-p-peer-reviewed-article-IJGM; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1178-7074; 1178-7074; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5a0352eff4ed431398bc3b67c5358632\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5a0352eff4ed431398bc3b67c5358632\",\"title\":\"Correlation Between Risk or Severity of Heart Failure and Outcome of Pregnancy\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Anita Deborah Anwar, Gatot NA Winarno, Elsy Nur Anggraeni Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran \\u2013 Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, IndonesiaCorrespondence: Anita Deborah AnwarDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran \\u2013 Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Jl.

Determinant factors, characteristics, and risk factors influence the incidence of heart disease in pregnancy, so the early detection of determinant factors can reduce the incidence of heart disease in pregnancy. This study aimed to find the relationship between determinant factors of maternal and fetal outcomes with the severity of heart disease in pregnancy.Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional analytical study. We used 342 cases of heart disease in pregnancy that were recorded in medical records at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, from January 2014 to December 2018. The data were grouped based on the severity of heart disease according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. The relationship of maternal determinant factors with the severity of heart disease was analyzed based on the NYHA classification.Results: Maternal occupation was significantly associated with a higher risk of NYHA class III\\u2013IV heart disease. Most of the patients with NYHA class III-IV were housewives. The severity of heart disease was also influenced by severe preeclampsia (p< 0.05) as a risk factor. Maternal outcome with heart disease of severity NYHA class III\\u2013IV was worse than with NYHA class I\\u2013II. The risk of maternal death was higher, and the mother\\u2019s length of stay in hospital and her need for monitoring were also increased. There were no significant differences in the outcome of the fetus, but the incidence of fetal mortality increased in patients with heart disease severity III\\u2013IV.Conclusion: Maternal determinant factors did not correlate with the severity of heart disease in pregnancy. Maternal outcomes were worse with increasing severity of heart disease. Fetal mortality was correlated with severity of heart disease but other outcomes were not affected.Keywords: determinant factor, heart disease, maternal and fetal outcomes\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of General Medicine, Vol Volume 13, Pp 201-206 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"determinant factor; heart disease; maternal and fetal outcomes; Medicine (General); R5-920\",\"subject\":\"determinant factor; heart disease; maternal and fetal outcomes; \",\"authors\":\"Anwar AD; Winarno GNA; Anggraeni EN\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/5a0352eff4ed431398bc3b67c5358632\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"dc0ebc15cbe0a875e77080198d12408a34087ee618a9ca5263fe73623ce4558d\",\"relevance\":98,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e560a519812d0782358dfe9d84124a7dbbc107b2f8e0deefe41229af246cc667\",\"relation\":\"boreal:239420; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2078.1\\/239420; doi:10.1093\\/ehjci\\/jeaa292; info:pmid\\/33188688; urn:ISSN:2047-2404; urn:EISSN:2047-2412\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2078.1\\/239420; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/ehjci\\/jeaa292\",\"title\":\"The year 2019 in the European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging: part II.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging was launched in 2012 and has during these years become one of the leading multimodality cardiovascular imaging journal.

In addition, we discuss the main features of cardiac dysfunction in the setting of liver cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and those following liver transplantation.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"arrhythmia; cardiogenic ischemic hepatitis; cirrhotic cardiomyopathy; congestive hepatopathy; heart failure; liver transplantation; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\",\"subject\":\"arrhythmia; cardiogenic ischemic hepatitis; cirrhotic cardiomyopathy; congestive hepatopathy; heart failure; liver transplantation; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\",\"authors\":\"El Hadi, Hamza; Di Vincenzo, Angelo; Vettor, Roberto; Rossato, Marco\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11577\\/3340066\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5d545ee3da2d2614518a2dceeee01d95c5adb9cf34f63e3f2c028dd884c76249\",\"relevance\":94,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"25f4c1b295732a33b47ff64cfce3a8cf39e429ba909d2fd80ac2806311853f69\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.3401406; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3401407; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3401407; oai:zenodo.org:3401407\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3401407; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3401407\",\"title\":\"ANALYSIS OF PREVALENCE OF CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT IN POPULATION OF PAKISTAN\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a very common heart defect in the population of Pakistan. Globally, its prevalence is about 10\\/1000 live births. Objectives: Hence, this study was aimed at detecting congenital heart disease in infants in population of Pakistan. Methodology: This descriptive study was conducted at Sheikh Zayed Hospital Rahim Yar Khan during December 2018 to July 2019. 500 infants who visited OPD for different complaints were assessed for congenital heart disease with the help of echocardiography. Results: Out of 500 infants, 303 (18%) were confirmed with congenital heart disease. Among the confirmed cases, 62.5 percent were males and 37.5 % were females. 78 % of the cases were between ages 1 to 3 months. The patients came with different presenting complaints like respiratory infection (48 %), underweight (31 %) and cyanosis (4%). Majority of cases were that of acyanotic congenital heart disease (98%). Ventricular septal defect (77.9%) was the most common congenital heart disease detected, followed by patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 11.5%, atrioventricular septal defect (ASD)7.9 %, teratology of Fallot (TOF) 0.9%, aortic stenosis2%. Conclusion: There is an utmost need to improve the efficacy of doctors of our pediatric OPDs to be able to detect heart murmur in our infant population.

Determinant factors, characteristics, and risk factors influence the incidence of heart disease in pregnancy, so the early detection of determinant factors can reduce the incidence of heart disease in pregnancy. This study aimed to find the relationship between determinant factors of maternal and fetal outcomes with the severity of heart disease in pregnancy.Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional analytical study. We used 342 cases of heart disease in pregnancy that were recorded in medical records at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, from January 2014 to December 2018. The data were grouped based on the severity of heart disease according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. The relationship of maternal determinant factors with the severity of heart disease was analyzed based on the NYHA classification.Results: Maternal occupation was significantly associated with a higher risk of NYHA class III\\u2013IV heart disease. Most of the patients with NYHA class III-IV were housewives. The severity of heart disease was also influenced by severe preeclampsia (p< 0.05) as a risk factor. Maternal outcome with heart disease of severity NYHA class III\\u2013IV was worse than with NYHA class I\\u2013II. The risk of maternal death was higher, and the mother\\u2019s length of stay in hospital and her need for monitoring were also increased. There were no significant differences in the outcome of the fetus, but the incidence of fetal mortality increased in patients with heart disease severity III\\u2013IV.Conclusion: Maternal determinant factors did not correlate with the severity of heart disease in pregnancy. Maternal outcomes were worse with increasing severity of heart disease.

Chronic kidney disease leads to early damage to the heart and blood vessels with the development of heart failure. The manifestation of one disease leads to the progression of another, since chronic heart failure is a condition in which the myocardium and kidneys are pathogenetically closely related to each other. The purpose of the work was to identify early predictors of chronic heart failure development and progression in patients with chronic kidney disease. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of case histories of 322 patients with chronic kidney disease stages 1\\u20134 was carried out. Patients were divided into two groups: the main group included those with chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure (n = 50), the comparison group \\u2014 patients with chronic kidney disease, but without chronic heart failure (n = 50). We studied the data of clinical, laboratory and instrumental examination. The obtained results were processed statistically. Results. Patients with chronic kidney disease and signs of heart failure had an increased body mass index, leg swelling, and stage 2 hypertension degrees 1\\u20132. The electrocardiograpy revealed a rhythm disturbance by the type of paroxysmal tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. A decrease in hemoglobin level, filtration function of the kidneys, as well as manifestations of dyslipidemia were detected. Conclusions. Diastolic hypertension, anemia and increased total cholesterol can be considered as early predictors of chronic heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. Consequently, the risk of heart failure development and progression increases with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml\\/min. Chronic heart failure develops earlier and progresses faster in patients with chronic kidney disease that developed as a result of chronic glomerulonephritis.\",\"published_in\":\"Po\\u010dki , Vol 8, Iss 1, Pp 29-33 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"predictors of heart failure; chronic kidney disease; anemia; Diseases of the genitourinary system.

Heart valve operation is the predominant treatment strategy for heart valve disease. This study analyzed the death risk from heart valve disease with respect to the frequency of heart valve operation and other operations in patients with mitral valve disease. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective nationwide population-based case\\u2013control study using a claims dataset from Taiwan\\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database. The case and control groups enrolled mitral valve disease patients from 2002 to 2013 who had either underwent an heart valve operation procedure or not, respectively. Conditional logistic regression was estimated the odds ratios (ORs) associated with various risk factors for heart valve operation-related death, including other operations and comorbidities. Results A total of 25,964 patients with mitral valve disease were recruited for the study and divided into heart valve operation (600 patients) and non-heart valve operation (25,364 patients) groups. After matching, a total of 1800 non-heart valve operation patients were selected for final analysis. Heart valve operation was associated with decreased risk of death (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.439), but operations related to other cardiovascular disease (CVD, aOR 3.691), respiratory conditions (aOR 3.210), and the urinary system (aOR 1.925) were associated with increased risk of death for patients with mitral valve disease. Patients with mitral valve disease and diabetes (aOR 1.505), chronic kidney disease (CKD, aOR 3.760), or emphysema (aOR 2.623) also had a higher risk of death. Patients who underwent more heart valve operations had a lower risk of death from mitral valve disease, but patients who underwent more other operations had a higher risk of death from mitral valve disease. Conclusions The death risk for patients with mitral valve disease patients could be lowered by more frequently performing heart valve operations. However, the risk of death is increased for patients with mitral valve disease who more frequently undergo other operations, chiefly those for other CVD system, respiratory conditions, and urinary system, or have comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and emphysema.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Vol 14, Iss 1, Pp 1-8 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Heart valve operations; Mitral valve disease; Other operations; Risk of death; Surgery; RD1-811; Anesthesiology; RD78.3-87.3\",\"subject\":\"Heart valve operations; Mitral valve disease; Other operations; Risk of death; Surgery;  Anesthesiology;; 3-3\",\"authors\":\"Ruo-Ling Li; Ci-Wen Luo; Yung-Chyuan Ho; Shiuan-Shinn Lee; Yu-Hsiang Kuan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s13019-019-0984-x\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"494527167b2f8c24763a98929e3bb76d84e2e7666054b2058710fd5e4b7bfb42\",\"relevance\":82,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s13019-019-0984-x\"},{\"id\":\"8fdd9972e0617844e3efa7e365a75ac23fe33af95f372a48bc028a39fba2ba05\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s41687-019-0165-7; http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/content\\/pdf\\/10.1186\\/s41687-019-0165-7.pdf; http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1186\\/s41687-019-0165-7\\/fulltext.html\",\"title\":\"A scoping review and mapping exercise comparing the content of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) across heart disease-specific scales\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Over the past decade, the importance of person-centered care has led to increased interest in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). In cardiovascular care, selecting an appropriate PROM for clinical use or research is challenging because multimorbidity is often common in patients. The aim was therefore to provide an overview of heart-disease specific PROMs and to compare the content of those outcomes using a bio-psycho-social framework of health. Methods A scoping review of heart disease-specific PROMs, including arrhythmia\\/atrial fibrillation, congenital heart disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and valve diseases was conducted in PubMed (January 2018). All items contained in the disease-specific PROMs were mapped to WHO\\u2019s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) according to standardized linking rules. Results A total of 34 PROMs (heart diseases in general n = 5; cardiac arrhythmia n = 6; heart failure n = 14; ischemic heart disease n = 9) and 147 ICF categories were identified. ICF categories covered Body functions ( n = 61), Activities & Participation ( n = 69), and Environmental factors ( n = 17). Most items were about experienced problems of Body functions and less often about patients\\u2019 daily activities, and most PROMs were specifically developed for heart failure and no PROM were identified for valve disease or congenital heart disease.

It has therefore been the subject of a tremendous amount of research, often with small-animal models such as rodents. However, the physiology of the human heart differs significantly from that of the rodent heart, underscoring the need for clinically relevant models to study heart disease. Here, we present a protocol to model ischemic heart disease using cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS-CMs) and to quantify the damage and functional impairment of the ischemic cardiomyocytes. Exposure to 2% oxygen without glucose and serum increases the percentage of injured cells, which is indicated by staining of the nucleus with propidium iodide, and decreases cellular viability. These conditions also decrease the contractility of hiPS-CMs as confirmed by displacement vector field analysis of microscopic video images. This protocol may furthermore provide a convenient method for personalized drug screening by facilitating the use of hiPS cells from individual patients. Therefore, this model of ischemic heart disease, based on iPS-CMs of human origin, can provide a useful platform for drug screening and further research on ischemic heart disease.\",\"published_in\":\"JoVE-Journal of Visualized Experiments\",\"year\":\"2020-07-31\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medicine; Issue 159; Ischemic heart disease; hypoxia; Myocardial infarction; Human induced pluripotent stem cells; cellular differentiation; Cardiomyocytes\",\"subject\":\"Medicine; Issue Ischemic heart disease; hypoxia; Myocardial infarction; Human induced pluripotent stem cells; cellular differentiation; Cardiomyocytes\",\"authors\":\"Liu, Yun; Liang, Yin; Wang, Mengxue; Wang, Chen; Wei, Heng; Naruse, Keiji; Takahashi, Ken\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ousar.lib.okayama-u.ac.jp\\/files\\/public\\/6\\/60253\\/2020073112015575177\\/fulltext.pdf\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"ef65cf01a3e9b48ca97124569d788ebd2e0320df1d2371f3a585a502194a18dc\",\"relevance\":80,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"7fa1e1013a072795207b6e1c74db7f12f042127e6a78782ea4540c63e9c8a23d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/KASACM-3\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/KASACM-3\",\"title\":\"A Conceptual Model: The Impact of Sociodemographic on Coronary Heart Disease\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The paper aims to examine the conceptual model on the impact of sociodemographic towards coronary heart disease.

Methods: In total, 23,498 monozygotic and 39,540 same-sex dizygotic twins from the Danish Twin Registry were followed from 1977 to 2011 in the Danish National Patient Registry for ischemic heart disease and stroke. Time-to-event analyses accounting for censoring and competing risk of death were used to estimate familial risk (casewise concordance relative to the cumulative incidence) and heritability of ischemic heart disease, stroke, and the co-occurrence by age. Results: During follow-up, we observed 5561 and 4186 twin individuals with ischemic heart disease and stroke respectively, with 936 twin pairs concordant for ischemic heart disease and stroke. Familial risks were significant for both, with higher cumulative risks in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins. Estimates for heritability were significant for ischemic heart disease as well as for stroke diagnosed after the age of 80. The casewise concordance of ischemic heart disease in twins whose co-twin was diagnosed with stroke did not differ for monozygotic and dizygotic twins; however, from age 55 it was 10% higher than the cumulative risk in the overall twin cohort and was 25% higher at age 90. A similar pattern was seen for stroke following the co-twin\\u2019s ischemic heart disease. Conclusions: As in previous studies, we found a higher heritability of ischemic heart disease than of stroke. There was a significant familial risk but no heritability for the co-occurrence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. The co-occurrence is therefore likely due to other shared familial than genetic factors, highlighting that preventive initiatives should target families rather than individuals.\",\"published_in\":\"Scandinavian Journal of Public Health ; page 140349482095332 ; ISSN 1403-4948 1651-1905\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health; General Medicine\",\"subject\":\"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health; General Medicine\",\"authors\":\"Osler, Merete; Villumsen, Martin Dalgaard; J\\u00f8rgensen, Martin Balslev; Hjelmborg, Jacob V.B.; Christensen, Kaare; Wium-Andersen, Marie Kim\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1403494820953322\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"3aa5f8b821323e63059d56ba5fe868dd95ad146440f3d4d6dc408b854e994ba5\",\"relevance\":77,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1403494820953322\"},{\"id\":\"ee079bbdbf071b678b32cb294a8f3db5997feafd6f6171cbbb6a9c065cdd34a9\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/cvr\\/cvaa062; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/cardiovascres\\/advance-article-pdf\\/doi\\/10.1093\\/cvr\\/cvaa062\\/33153088\\/cvaa062.pdf\",\"title\":\"Macrophage lineages in heart valve development and disease\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Heterogeneous macrophage lineages are present in the aortic and mitral valves of the heart during development and disease.

Hypothesis Focused cardiac ultrasound by a nonspecialist practitioner (NSP) will increase the detection of occult heart disease in asymptomatic cats compared with physical examination and ECG. Animals Three hundred forty\\u2010three client\\u2010owned cats: 54 excluded and 289 analyzed. Methods Multicenter prospective cohort study. Twenty\\u2010two NSPs were trained to perform FCU. Cats without clinical signs of heart disease were recruited, and NSPs performed the following in sequential order: physical examination, ECG, FCU, and point\\u2010of\\u2010care N\\u2010terminal pro\\u2010B\\u2010type natriuretic peptide assay (POC\\u2010BNP). After each step, NSPs indicated yes, no, or equivocal as to whether they believed heart disease was present. The level of agreement between the NSP diagnosis and a blinded cardiologist's diagnosis after echocardiogram was evaluated using Cohen's kappa test. Results Cardiologist diagnoses included 148 normal cats, 102 with heart disease, and 39 equivocal ones. Agreement between NSP and cardiologist was slight after physical examination (kappa 0.253 [95% CI, 0.172\\u20100.340]), did not increase after ECG (0.256 [0.161\\u20100.345]; P = .96), increased after FCU (0.468 [0.376\\u20100.558]; P = .002), and the level of agreement was similar after POC\\u2010BNP (0.498 [0.419\\u20100.580]; P = .67). In cats with mild, moderate, and marked occult heart disease, the proportion of cats having a NSP diagnosis of heart disease after FCU was 45.6%, 93.1%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Focused cardiac ultrasound performed by NSPs increased the detection of occult heart disease, especially in cats with moderate to marked disease. Focused cardiac ultrasound appears to be a feasible and useful tool to assist NSPs in the detection of heart disease in cats.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Vol 33, Iss 5, Pp 1892-1901 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"cardiomyopathy; echocardiography; ECG; feline; myocardial disease; Veterinary medicine; SF600-1100\",\"subject\":\"cardiomyopathy; echocardiography; ECG; feline; myocardial disease; Veterinary medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Kerry A.

There are limited data available about epidemiology ofheart failure in low-income countries like Nepal. The main objective of this study is to explore etiological spectrum of heartfailure in Nepal. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the cardiology department of Kathmandu Medical College fromApril 15, 2019, to July 15, 2019. Data were collected from patients diagnosed as heart failure following the European Societyof Cardiology criteria and having left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50% and classified into Heart failure with midrangeor reduced ejection fraction. Diastolic heart failure, Cor-pulmonale, and stroke were excluded. The data were enteredand analyzed in Statistical Package for Social Sciences 20.0 using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Among 132 heart failure patients (mean age: 63.9\\u00b113.9 years), around two-thirds (65.2%) had heart failure withreduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction of less than 40%) and one third (34.8%) had heart failure with mid-range ejectionfraction (40 to 49%). Dilated cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of heart failure among nearly half (47.7%) of studyparticipants, followed by valvular heart disease (19.7%), hypertensive heart disease (14.4%) and ischaemic heart disease(13.6%). Almost half of the study participants with dilated cardiomyopathy had severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.(p<0.05). Conclusion: Dilated cardiomyopathy was the most prevalent cause of heart failure, followed by valvular heart disease inour study.\",\"published_in\":\"Nepalese Heart Journal; Vol 16 No 2 (2019); 23-28 ; 2382-5464 ; 2091-2978\",\"year\":\"2019-11-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Bhattarai, Mahesh; Shah, Rakesh Kumar; Sainju, Nayan Kamal; Bhandari, Buna; Keshari, Sumir; Karki, Damber Bahadur\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.nepjol.info\\/index.php\\/NHJ\\/article\\/view\\/26313\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"078f2b12fdbcc9133441a0c90dd8b54ab2f2b98c7b6276b91ec9fe9dbb3ec7f5\",\"relevance\":71,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2819f94e0dcfcd976cfc2e8725022a79da526a217f5fe3cb1cf6b27d566806f1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.tci-thaijo.org\\/index.php\\/JNAT\\/article\\/view\\/174863\\/135770; https:\\/\\/www.tci-thaijo.org\\/index.php\\/JNAT\\/article\\/view\\/174863\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.tci-thaijo.org\\/index.php\\/JNAT\\/article\\/view\\/174863\",\"title\":\"Eating Pattern in Muslim Patients with Coronary Heart Disease ; \\u0e41\\u0e19\\u0e27\\u0e17\\u0e32\\u0e07\\u0e01\\u0e32\\u0e23\\u0e23\\u0e31\\u0e1a\\u0e1b\\u0e23\\u0e30\\u0e17\\u0e32\\u0e19\\u0e2d\\u0e32\\u0e2b\\u0e32\\u0e23\\u0e43\\u0e19\\u0e1c\\u0e39\\u0e49\\u0e1b\\u0e48\\u0e27\\u0e22\\u0e21\\u0e38\\u0e2a\\u0e25\\u0e34\\u0e21\\u0e42\\u0e23\\u0e04\\u0e2b\\u0e25\\u0e2d\\u0e14\\u0e40\\u0e25\\u0e37\\u0e2d\\u0e14\\u0e2b\\u0e31\\u0e27\\u0e43\\u0e08\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Coronary heart disease has the highest mortality rate in Thailand and the world.

Some computational methods have been proposed to predict the patient\\u2019s heart disease risk. Meanwhile, the accurate prediction of diseases is a critical aspect of machine learning and to further enhance the classification of heart disease risk, this paper proposes an improved ensemble learning approach. The mean of the data columns is used to partition the dataset into smaller subsets, and then a classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is applied to model each partition. Randomization is introduced during the data partitioning. The resulting ensemble produces a robust model for the prediction of heart disease risk. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the Cleveland and Framingham heart disease datasets are used. When compared with other machine learning methods and some recent scholarly works, the proposed method showed significant improvement.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Ensemble learning; Machine learning; CART\",\"subject\":\"Ensemble learning; Machine learning; CART\",\"authors\":\"Mienye, Ibomoiye Domor; Sun, Yanxia; Wang, Zenghui\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10210\\/430433\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"9a5402c9c13000b7d4204a35a41d46b5c1a49035e2cc78322683c94ce2562442\",\"relevance\":69,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"a81603eafdc1878c894f45f307581de16d3f73b74fd111af788b071b9857b702\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ecrjournal.com\\/articles\\/chagas-disease-heart-failure-issue-worldwide; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1758-3756; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1758-3764; doi:10.15420\\/ecr.2018.30.2; 1758-3764; 1758-3756; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3c4cca618885462184b4cb15bef4ff6b\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15420\\/ecr.2018.30.2; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3c4cca618885462184b4cb15bef4ff6b\",\"title\":\"Chagas Disease and Heart Failure: An Expanding Issue Worldwide\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Chagas disease, originally a South American endemic health problem, is expanding worldwide because of people migration. Its main impact is on the cardiovascular system, producing myocardial damage that frequently results in heart failure. Pathogenic pathways are mainly related to inmunoinflamatory reactions in the myocardium and, less frequently, in the gastrointestinal tract. The heart usually shows fibrosis, producing dilatation and damage of the electrogenic cardiac system. These changes result in cardiomyopathy with heart failure and frequent cardiac arrhythmias and heart blocks. Diagnosis of the disease must include a lab test to detect the parasite or its immune reactions and the usual techniques to evaluate cardiac function. Therapeutic management of Chagas heart failure does not differ significantly from the most common treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy, with special focus on arrhythmias and several degrees of heart block. Heart transplantation is reserved for end-stage cases. Major international scientific organisations are delivering recommendations for prevention and early diagnosis.

This study describes the reported cases of congenital heart disease in Portugal in 2015 regarding antenatal diagnosis, cardiac defect, and presence of other congenital anomalies\\/chromosomal abnormalities. These indicators are compared in live births and medical pregnancy terminations. Additionally, postnatal deaths were characterized. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Congenital heart disease data derived from the 2015 Portuguese National Registry of Congenital Birth Defects were analyzed. The prevalence rates per 1000 births were assessed by the chi-square test of independence. RESULTS: The prevalence of congenital heart disease in this study was 5\\/1000 live-births (339 live-births, 20% with critical defects). The most common defects were ventricular septal defect (38%), atrial septal defect (15%), aortic coarctation (7%), tetralogy of Fallot (7%) and pulmonary stenosis (5%). One third of the live births had antenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease. In the live-births with critical congenital heart disease, 54% had antenatal diagnosis and 14% were diagnosed at birth. There were records of 84 pregnancy terminations; 49% had critical defects, 75% had non-cardiac congenital anomalies and 40% had chromosomal abnormalities. There were 15 postnatal deaths recorded (3.4% mortality rate), associated with prematurity\\/low birthweight, critical congenital heart disease, other non-cardiac congenital anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities. DISCUSSION: The data analysis revealed a prevalence of congenital heart disease in this study of 5\\/1000 births (inferior to other international studies), with a distribution per type of anomaly similar to that reported in previously published work. There were significant regional differences that need further studying. CONCLUSION: These results are paramount to characterize the Portuguese scenario and improve Healthcare planning. It is important to improve reporting in the Portuguese National Registry of Congenital Birth Defects. ; publishersversion ; published\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Heart Defects; Congenital \\/ epidemiology; Portugal; Registries; Medicine(all)\",\"subject\":\"Heart Defects; Congenital \\/ epidemiology; Portugal; Registries;\",\"authors\":\"Melo, Isabel Saraiva; Braz, Paula; Roquette, Rita; Sousa, Paulo; Nunes, Carla; Dias, Carlos\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10362\\/101777\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b7c4b74c32de7838da4915e884dbcb7cc9cae44ce38209d96cda12a0d4bda826\",\"relevance\":67,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"43a2a550a77f471f01b017157785e96556977e9ca042425ceeacfdc6108bd5c7\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1186\\/s13104-019-4803-1; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1756-0500; doi:10.1186\\/s13104-019-4803-1; 1756-0500; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/506e8c9bae3b4057b6e98b9cf892f775\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s13104-019-4803-1; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/506e8c9bae3b4057b6e98b9cf892f775\",\"title\":\"The spectrum of heart disease among adults at the Bamenda Regional Hospital, North west Cameroon: a semi urban setting\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Objective We sought to determine the spectrum of heart diseases among adult patients at the Bamenda Regional Hospital in the North West Region of Cameroon.

Due to the heterogeneity of ACHD and secondary complications, risk profiles are, however, not uniform. This document aims to give an overview of relevant data and outline our pragmatic approach to disease prevention and management. Based on anatomy and additional physiological factors including symptoms, exercise capacity, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis, we propose a pragmatic approach to categorising patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk groups. We regard especially patients with complex cyanotic conditions, those with palliated univentricular hearts, heart failure, severe valvular disease or pulmonary hypertension as high-risk patients. To avoid infection, we recommend self-isolation and exemption from work for these cohorts. Infected ACHD patients with low or moderate risk and without signs of deterioration may be remotely followed and cared for at home while in self isolation. High-risk patients or those with signs of respiratory or cardiovascular impairment require admission ideally at a tertiary ACHD centre. Especially patients with complex, cyanotic disease, heart failure and arrhythmias require particular attention. Treatment in patients with cyanotic heart disease should be guided by the relative degree of desaturation compared with baseline and lactate levels rather than absolute oxygen saturation levels. Patients with right heart dilatation or dysfunction are potentially at increased risk of right heart failure as mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome can lead to increase in pulmonary arterial pressures.\",\"published_in\":\"Heart, vol. 106, iss. 17, pp. 1302-1309\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Radboudumc 0: Other Research RIHS: Radboud Institute for Health Sciences\",\"subject\":\"Radboudumc 0: Other Research RIHS: Radboud Institute for Health Sciences\",\"authors\":\"Radke, R.M.; Frenzel, T.; Baumgartner, H; Diller, G.P.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2066\\/225292\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"9e6adbf5c6f97f420b6aec55606f1442fd44dc056dad35987af588c879998f79\",\"relevance\":65,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2fa98fc83a0ada919f4804f9f8855bd33beee71a18ffbc9c07f6d449d48f47ba\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.jfmpc.com\\/article.asp?issn=2249-4863;year=2020;volume=9;issue=3;spage=1431;epage=1435;aulast=Prasad; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2249-4863; 2249-4863; doi:10.4103\\/jfmpc.jfmpc_1056_19; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/82632cb125774c508beea1117fa82a0d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.4103\\/jfmpc.jfmpc_1056_19; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/82632cb125774c508beea1117fa82a0d\",\"title\":\"Compliance to the secondary prophylaxis and awareness of rheumatic heart disease: A cross-sectional study in low-income province of India\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: Rheumatic heart disease is a preventable problem and regular secondary prophylaxis and proper awareness about this disease among common people may reduce the burden of this disease in any region.

Methods: One-hundred-eighty children (aged 1-15 years) with underlying heart disease were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. The heart failures were categorized based on the Ross classification into 2 groups, non-heart failure (Ross classification I) and heart failure (Ross classification II-IV). The NT\\u2010proBNP level was determined and chest radiograph was done in posteroanterior upright position for CT ratio. Results: The mean NT-proBNP level was 223.1 pg\\/ml (+180.3) and a mean CT ratio was 53.6% (+5.6) in the non-heart failure group. The mean NT-proBNP level was 1,054 pg\\/ml (+1,840.3) and a mean CT ratio was 58.6% (+6.1) in heart failure group. There was a significantly positive correlation between heart failure symptoms and the level of NT-proBNP and CT ratio.

Marginalization related Diminished Returns (MDRs) refer to smaller health benefits of high SES for racial and ethnic minorities compared to the majority group. It is still unknown, however, if MDRs also apply to the effects of education on heart disease. Purpose: Using a nationally representative sample, we explored racial\\/ethnic variation in the link between educational attainment and heart disease among American adults. Methods: We analyzed data (n=25,659) from a nationally representative survey of American adults in 2013. The first wave of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health - Adult (PATH-Adult) study was used. The independent variable was education (college graduate, high school graduate, less than a high school diploma). The dependent variable was any heart disease. Age and gender were the covariates. Race, as well as ethnicity, were the moderators. Logistic regressions were used to analyze the data. Results: Individuals with higher educational attainment had lower odds of heart disease. Race and ethnicity showed statistically significant interactions with education, suggesting that the protective effect of higher education on reducing odds of heart disease was smaller for Hispanic and Black people than for non-Hispanic and White individuals. Conclusion: Education reduces the risk of heart disease better among non-Hispanic Whites than for Hispanics and Blacks. Therefore, we may expect a disproportionately higher than expected risk of heart disease in Hispanics and Blacks with high educational attainment. Future research should test if the presence of high levels of environmental and behavioral risk factors contribute to the high risk of heart disease in highly educated Black and Hispanic Americans. Policymakers should not reduce health inequalities to just gaps in SES because disparities are present across SES levels, with high SES Blacks and Hispanics remaining at risk of health problems.\",\"published_in\":\"The Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal ; volume 14, issue 1, page 5-12 ; ISSN 1874-1924\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\",\"subject\":\"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\",\"authors\":\"Assari, Shervin; Cobb, Sharon; Saqib, Mohammed; Bazargan, Mohsen\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2174\\/1874192402014010005\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c08abec6c310a2f4ac8d073271d90392a37f811f888972c73bebbd5b502e4003\",\"relevance\":57,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.2174\\/1874192402014010005\"},{\"id\":\"39e2d06b33aab0fd550aa0a03f6e76bb920aa79a78cc72142e9e3db064696dff\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/e-journal.unair.ac.id\\/MOG\\/article\\/view\\/13083\\/7412; http:\\/\\/e-journal.unair.ac.id\\/MOG\\/article\\/view\\/13083; doi:10.20473\\/mog.V1I12019.17-23\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/e-journal.unair.ac.id\\/MOG\\/article\\/view\\/13083; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.20473\\/mog.V1I12019.17-23\",\"title\":\"Maternal mortality risk factor in pregnancy with heart disease at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Objectives: This research want to identify some factors that increasing risk of maternal death in pregnant woman with heart disease.Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective analytic study with cross sectional design, with total sampling 92 patient with heart disease in pregnancy at maternity room Dr. Soetomo hospital, Surabaya, during periode January until December 2017.Results: Prevalency of pregnancy with heart disease in dr.

Ischemic heart disease incidence and its risk factors were studied in 196 coalmine workers (sinkers, stope miners). Rose Questionnaire, daily ECG monitoring and bicycle ergometry were used to detect angina. The indices of lipid metabolism, hemostatic system, the level of homocysteine, uric acid, C-reactive protein, constitutional-morphological type by Rees \\u2013 Eysenck, genetic markers of blood groups of AB0, P and MN systems were studied.When elaborating the prognostic system, we used the Bayes method. A prognostic coefficient was calculated for each factor. Prediction of ischemic heart disease was carried out according to the sum of prognostic coefficients.Results. Ischemic heart disease was detected in 18 (9.2 %) miners. According to the above mentioned indices, a medical technology was elaborated to predict the ischemic heart disease, based on the determination of the most significant risk markers: age, work experience in harmful working conditions, type A behavior, arterial hypertension, fasting hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, decrease in the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, increase in the value of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, hyperfibrinogenemia, increase in the level of soluble fibrin monomer complexes and C-reactive protein, abdominal obesity, hypersthenic constitutional-morphological type by Rees \\u2013 Eysenck, genetic markers of blood groups of AB0, P and MN systems.Conclusion.

RECENT FINDINGS:Current data demonstrate that adults with CHD generally experience higher short-term mortality after heart transplantation and MCS implantation, but enjoy superior long-term survival. Such patients are nonetheless less likely to receive a transplant than non-ACHD peers due to a variety of factors, including lack of applicability of current listing criteria to HF in ACHD. MCS is underutilized in ACHD, but provides similar quality of life benefits for ACHD and non-ACHD patients alike. Heart failure in ACHD is complex and difficult to treat, and both heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support are often challenging to implement in this patient population. However, long-term results are encouraging, and existing data supports increasing use of MCS and transplant earlier in their disease course. Multidisciplinary care is critical to success in these complex patients.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-02-01T14:42:25Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Adult congenital heart disease; Failing Fontan; Heart transplantation; LVAD; Mechanical circulatory support\",\"subject\":\"Adult congenital heart disease; Failing Fontan; Heart transplantation; LVAD; Mechanical circulatory support\",\"authors\":\"Serfas, John D; Patel, Priyesh A; Krasuski, Richard A\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10161\\/17940\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"3dd92f6f4e207ab177d1a888a7b3c88018d5341db5d9a3aadde7e8e65db37409\",\"relevance\":52,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"c2207c438c32b3dcf3093692d388cafb938c521b1fbabd65478bdbd4fbfcc552\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.hvt-journal.com\\/articles\\/art164; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1694-7886; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1694-7894; 1694-7886; 1694-7894; doi:10.24969\\/hvt.2019.164; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/ea696633c8164836b54e2c4f208b6029\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24969\\/hvt.2019.164; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/ea696633c8164836b54e2c4f208b6029\",\"title\":\"The proportion of coronary heart disease in development of chronic heart failure by retrospective analysis of three-year registry of hospitalization cases in tertiary healthcare institutions of Kyrgyz Republic\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this retrospective study, we analyzed epidemiological aspects and etiological structure of heart failure in tertiary cardiac hospitals of republic, namely National Center of Cardiology and SRI of Heart Surgery and Organs Transplantation in three-year follow-up from 2016 to 2018.

Over the last years, cardiopulmonary exercise test has gained importance in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of congenital heart diseases, as has already occurred in HF. Objective: To describe the behavior of hemodynamic, metabolic and ventilatory parameters in response to exercise in adults with congenital heart disease. Methods: Observational cross-sectional study evaluating 31 adults with congenital acyanotic or cyanotic heart disease, treated clinically, surgically or percutaneously, referred for cardiopulmonary exercise test. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed. Results: Patients aged 35.7 \\u00b1 14.2 years were included. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was 44.86 \\u00b1 18.01% of predicted at peak exercise and 36.92 \\u00b1 12.93% of predicted maximal VO2 at anaerobic threshold.

Ischemic heart disease is one of the most frequent causes of heart failure and it is normally attributed to coronary artery disease, defined by the presence of one or more obstructive plaques, which determine a reduced coronary blood flow, causing myocardial ischemia and consequent heart failure. However, coronary obstruction is only an element of a complex pathophysiological process that leads to myocardial ischemia. In the literature, attention paid to the role of microcirculation, in the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and heart failure, is growing. Coronary microvascular dysfunction determines an inability of coronary circulation to satisfy myocardial metabolic demands, due to the imbalance of coronary blood flow regulatory mechanisms, including ion channels, leading to the development of hypoxia, fibrosis and tissue death, which may determine a loss of myocardial function, even beyond the presence of atherosclerotic epicardial plaques. For this reason, ion channels may represent the link among coronary microvascular dysfunction, ischemic heart disease and consequent heart failure.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Molecular Sciences, Vol 21, Iss 3167, p 3167 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"heart failure; ischemic heart disease; microcirculation; ion channel; coronary artery disease; coronary microvascular dysfunction; Biology (General); QH301-705.5; Chemistry; QD1-999\",\"subject\":\"heart failure; ischemic heart disease; microcirculation; ion channel; coronary artery disease; coronary microvascular dysfunction;  Chemistry; \",\"authors\":\"Paolo Severino; Andrea D\\u2019Amato; Mariateresa Pucci; Fabio Infusino; Lucia Ilaria Birtolo; Marco Valerio Mariani; Carlo Lavalle; Viviana Maestrini; Massimo Mancone; Francesco Fedele\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijms21093167\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"d495501464b3249736d9cd4c90b7def78eeaff6521c94ef265efd9ce8bf38ccf\",\"relevance\":47,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijms21093167\"},{\"id\":\"a2149159d5dee3456111de14f00cf66e5d84c14404d676aa430082aa462c0648\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.3251638; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3251639; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3251639; oai:zenodo.org:3251639\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3251639; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3251639\",\"title\":\"FEATURES OF THE COURSE OF THE CHRONIC RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE IN MODERN CONDITIONS\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Yakimenko \\u0415. \\u0410., Zakatova L.

The prevalence of a chronic rheumatic heart disease among adult population of Ukraine (18 years and older) is 397.6 on 100 thousand population, and incidence \\u2014 6.4 on 100 thousand adult population. In Ukraine the specific weight of a chronic rheumatic heart disease as the reasons of primary disability among all population and employable population continues to remain the same (0.4 %) without tendency to decrease. At 30-50 % of patients with rheumatic heart diseases in the anamnesis do not reveal data on the postponed acute rheumatic fever. For the last decade the incidence of a chronic rheumatic heart disease decreased by 60 %, however, mortality increased by 78 %. Dynamics of negotiability to rheumatological departament of patients with acute and chronic forms of rheumatism and feature of a course of a chronic rheumatic heart disease in modern conditions was analysed. It was established that now the chronic rheumatic heart disease develops without the previous acute rheumatic fever, it is diagnosed at a stage of the formed heart disease or development of disturbances of a heartbeat and, is compensated throughout a long time. The clinical example of the patient having a chronic rheumatic heart disease is provided. Feature of this clinical case are: the long asymptomatic course of damage of heart, initially revealed mitral and aortal defect at the age of 51 year with prevalence of a mitral stenosis complicated by fibrillation of auricles; a mitral commissurotomy at the age of 56 years with fast development of a restenosis (in 58 years) when prosthetics of the mitral valve was offered; many years (up to 76 years) rather satisfactory condition with sharp deterioration within one month, due to the revealed critical mitral stenosis, heart failure \\u0406\\u0406\\u0406 St. Key words: acute rheumatic fever, chronic rheumatic heart disease, features of a current, clinical case.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-05-24\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Yakimenko, \\u0415. \\u0410.; Zakatova, L.

; Appropriate care behaviors of parents for children with congenital heart disease can relieve various complications their children\\u2019s disease. With proper care, these ill children can also be treated through heart surgery as physician\\u2019s plan. This descriptive correlational study aimed to explore care behaviors of parents on preventing respiratory infection in children with congenital heart disease, and the relationship between knowledge, self-efficacy and care behaviors of parents on preventing respiratory tract infection in children with congenital heart disease. The conceptual framework of this study based on literature review of the researcher. The study sample consisted of 102 parents of children aged 1to- 6 years old with acyanotic congenital heart disease who were scheduled for heart surgery. Participants were recruited through the inclusion criteria during follow-up appointments at the out-patient cardiac clinic of tertiary public hospitals in Northern Thailand. Data were collected from January 2014 to March 2014. Research instruments included: 1) the Demographic Data of Parents and Children with Congenital Heart Disease record form, 2) the Parental Knowledge of Care Behaviors to Prevent Respiratory Infection in Children with Congenital Heart Disease Questionnaire, 3) the Parental Self-efficacy of Care Behaviors on Preventing Respiratory Tract Infection in Children with Congenital Heart Disease Questionnaire, and 4) the Parental Care Behaviors to Prevent Respiratory Infection in Children with Congenital Heart Disease Questionnaire. The last three questionnaires had a content validity index of .92, .83 and .93, respectively with reliability rates of .78, .97 and .89 respectively. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Spearman statistical correlation. The study findings showed that: All parents had high levels of care behaviors on preventing respiratory infection in children with congenital heart disease. Within each dimension, all parents showed high levels of care behaviors in providing the suitable nutrition, getting immunizations, and isolation and contact precaution. Additionally, 98% of the sample possessed a high level of ability in administrating medication to prevent congestive heart failure. Parental care behaviors had a statistically significant positive relationship to knowledge and self-efficacy. The relationship was at a moderate level (r = .367, p <.001, and r = .658, p <.001, respectively). The results of this study bring about better understanding to nurses to nurses regarding the parental care behaviors on preventing respiratory tract infections in children with congenital heart disease.

The prevalence of a chronic rheumatic heart disease among adult population of Ukraine (18 years and older) is 397.6 on 100 thousand population, and incidence \\u2014 6.4 on 100 thousand adult population. In Ukraine the specific weight of a chronic rheumatic heart disease as the reasons of primary disability among all population and employable population continues to remain the same (0.4 %) without tendency to decrease. At 30-50 % of patients with rheumatic heart diseases in the anamnesis do not reveal data on the postponed acute rheumatic fever. For the last decade the incidence of a chronic rheumatic heart disease decreased by 60 %, however, mortality increased by 78 %. Dynamics of negotiability to rheumatological departament of patients with acute and chronic forms of rheumatism and feature of a course of a chronic rheumatic heart disease in modern conditions was analysed. It was established that now the chronic rheumatic heart disease develops without the previous acute rheumatic fever, it is diagnosed at a stage of the formed heart disease or development of disturbances of a heartbeat and, is compensated throughout a long time. The clinical example of the patient having a chronic rheumatic heart disease is provided. Feature of this clinical case are: the long asymptomatic course of damage of heart, initially revealed mitral and aortal defect at the age of 51 year with prevalence of a mitral stenosis complicated by fibrillation of auricles; a mitral commissurotomy at the age of 56 years with fast development of a restenosis (in 58 years) when prosthetics of the mitral valve was offered; many years (up to 76 years) rather satisfactory condition with sharp deterioration within one month, due to the revealed critical mitral stenosis, heart failure \\u0406\\u0406\\u0406 St. Key words: acute rheumatic fever, chronic rheumatic heart disease, features of a current, clinical case.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-09-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Yakimenko, \\u0415. \\u0410.; Zakatova, L.

It was originally a health problem endemic to South America, predominantly affecting residents of poor rural areas. With globalization and increasing migratory flows from these areas to large cities, the immigration of T. cruzi chronically-infected people to developed, non-endemic countries has occurred. This issue has emerged as an important consideration for heart transplant professionals. Currently, Chagas patients with end-stage heart failure may need a heart transplantation (HTx). This implies that in post-transplant immunosuppression therapy to avoid rejection in the recipient, there is the possibility of T. cruzi infection reactivation, increasing the morbidity and mortality rates. The management of heart transplant recipients due to Chagas disease requires awareness for early recognition and parasitic treatment of T. cruzi infection reactivation. This issue poses challenges for heart transplant professionals, especially regarding the differential diagnosis between rejection and reactivation episodes. The aim of this review is to discuss the complexity of the Chagas disease reactivation phenomenon in patients submitted to HTx for end-stage chagasic cardiomyopathy.\",\"published_in\":\"Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease, Vol 5, Iss 106, p 106 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"chagasic cardiomyopathy; heart transplantation; Chagas disease reactivation; cardiac allograft rejection; treatment of reactivation; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"chagasic cardiomyopathy; heart transplantation; Chagas disease reactivation; cardiac allograft rejection; treatment of reactivation; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Maria da Consola\\u00e7\\u00e3o Vieira Moreira; Jos\\u00e9 Renan Cunha-Melo\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/tropicalmed5030106\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"837df37261f42563306e46c8b44dc5721af11e5630771aef55541c10e4ba444b\",\"relevance\":43,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/tropicalmed5030106\"},{\"id\":\"9da242241d62e6aaa54eb3f80aff0e3ec6c17b32ae3c9d882f8a47a5f640eeab\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/kazanmedjournal.ru\\/kazanmedj\\/article\\/viewFile\\/13364\\/10570; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0368-4814; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2587-9359; 0368-4814; 2587-9359; doi:10.17816\\/KMJ2019-530; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/16c37dee709e45a4ad4f17e06883359a\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17816\\/KMJ2019-530; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/16c37dee709e45a4ad4f17e06883359a\",\"title\":\"Diagnosis of chronic heart failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Aim. To identify methods for diagnosing early signs of heart failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods. We examined 54 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without exacerbation. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 - 26 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in combination with chronic heart failure; group 2 - 28 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without chronic heart failure. The groups were comparable by age and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Electrocardiography, echocardiography were performed with additional determination of the right heart chamber parameters, spirometry, X-ray, pulse oximetry. The level of highly sensitive C-reactive protein, blood acid-base composition and brain natriuretic peptide was evaluated. Results. Patients with comorbidity have decreased exercise tolerance according to the 6-minute walk test and mMRS scale, higher body mass index and dyspnea intensity, larger linear dimensions of the heart chambers and their volume parameters. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was observed in 21 (80%) of patients in group 1, therefore, the signs of heart failure can be explained by diastolic dysfunction of the right and left ventricles. Among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure in our study, extended linear dimensions and structural changes in the ventricles, indicating pre- and postcapillary hypertension, were significantly more common. Conclusion. The use of tissue Doppler study allows more accurately determining the diastolic function of the right and left ventricles; the brain natriuretic peptide study is a sensitive marker of early forms of diastolic chronic heart failure.\",\"published_in\":\"Kazanskij Medicinskij \\u017durnal, Vol 100, Iss 3, Pp 530-536 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic heart failure; diastolic dysfunction of the right and left ventricles; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic heart failure; diastolic dysfunction of the right and left ventricles; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"V I Koliev; I E Sarapulova; L V Ryabova\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17816\\/KMJ2019-530\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"9da242241d62e6aaa54eb3f80aff0e3ec6c17b32ae3c9d882f8a47a5f640eeab\",\"relevance\":42,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17816\\/KMJ2019-530\"},{\"id\":\"047ebc306b3c336c9896d842edf0d3c063646014f147ac21f9bfd93a495a3276\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.sciencepubco.com\\/index.php\\/ijet\\/article\\/view\\/14874\\/15345; https:\\/\\/www.sciencepubco.com\\/index.php\\/ijet\\/article\\/view\\/14874; doi:10.14419\\/ijet.v7i4.14874\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.sciencepubco.com\\/index.php\\/ijet\\/article\\/view\\/14874; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14419\\/ijet.v7i4.14874\",\"title\":\"Proposing a new methodology on vague association rule mining for the diagnosis of heart disease hesitation patterns\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In the realistic situation, the health care has which contain imprecisely specified data.

The reduction in prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease in a symptomatic population causes a lower pretest probability and clinical likelihood of disease, influencing the diagnostic work-up. Noninvasive functional or anatomic imaging for myocardial ischemia is recommended as the initial test to diagnose coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients, where obstructive disease cannot be excluded by clinical assessment alone.

The mean NT-proBNP level was 1,054 pg\\/ml (+1,840.3) and a mean CT ratio was 58.6% (+6.1) in heart failure group. There was a significantly positive correlation between heart failure symptoms and the level of NT-proBNP and CT ratio. In this study, the cut-off value of NT-proBNP for heart failure was more than 400 pg\\/ml (OR 6.97, ROC 0.694, sensitivity 52.6%, specificity 86.3%) and CT ratio more than 55% (OR 3.57, ROC 0.654, sensitivity 68%, specificity 62.8%). Conclusion: In pediatric heart diseases, there are strong positive correlations between heart failure with both NT-proBNP and CT ratio. These correlations help in the diagnosis of heart failure. NT-proBNP level more than 400 pg\\/ml and CT ratio more than 55% are indicative of heart failure in our population. Both investigations are inexpensive, readily available and do not require specialist experts.\",\"published_in\":\"Siriraj Medical Journal; Vol 71 No 5 (2019): September-October; 356-363 ; 2228-8082 ; 2629-995X\",\"year\":\"2019-09-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Jittham, Worawan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.tci-thaijo.org\\/index.php\\/sirirajmedj\\/article\\/view\\/217185\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"4746e77bb872f41e7e61e1c3a935f62bd04426cdec6a050e2a04d1c2fcc968ee\",\"relevance\":36,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"c1c2564971ff3465238b0ff98f81edc881fa831a9e6060aae3492889bda9d877\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/jebmh.com\\/assets\\/data_pdf\\/Geetika_Kalra_-_FINAL.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2349-2562; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2349-2570; doi:10.18410\\/jebmh\\/2019\\/505; 2349-2562; 2349-2570; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/4650330becd2498e8ed8fcc885c444ec\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.18410\\/jebmh\\/2019\\/505; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/4650330becd2498e8ed8fcc885c444ec\",\"title\":\"A STUDY OF PATTERN OF CARDIAC VALVULAR INVOLVEMENT IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE BY USING 2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY\",\"paper_abstract\":\"BACKGROUND Rheumatic Heart Disease is estimated to affect more than 15 million people worldwide and leads to 2,30,000 deaths every year.1 More than 80% of children younger than 15 years of age grow up in the regions of the world where RHD is endemic.2 In developing countries the course is more violent with severe valvular pathological lesions necessitating surgery in young children.3 METHODS A total of 550 patients attending Subharti Medical College with confirmed valvular heart disease were studied for a period of 1 year using clinical and echocardiographic examination. 350 of these patients had rheumatic heart disease as the aetiology of valvular disease. RESULTS In this study, we used clinical and echocardiographic examination over a period of 1 year and evaluated 550 patients with confirmed valvular heart disease 350 of whom were diagnosed to have rheumatic heart diseases (RHD). 57.14% of these were females and the majority (26.28%) were in the age group of 16-20 years at the time of diagnosis. Our study also revealed that a vast majority of these patients (291) had mitral valve involvement (83.14%) of which 226 patients had isolated mitral stenosis (64.57%). The pulmonary valve was the least affected of all (1.71%). There were no patients with pure tricuspid stenosis. Tricuspid regurgitation (2.28%), pulmonary regurgitation (1.71%). Left sided lesions were far more common with pure MS (64.57%), pure MR (7.14%) and isolated AR and AS at 1.43% and 8.86%, respectively. The mixed valvular lesions were 14%. CONCLUSIONS Rheumatic heart disease was found to be more prevalent in females in the age group 16-20 years and involving the left side of heart more commonly.

However, heart can also cause diseases that affect the death. World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2012 showed that all deaths from cardiovascular disease (vascular) 7.4 million (42.3%) were caused by heart disease. Increased cases of heart disease require a step as an early prevention and prevention efforts by making early diagnosis of heart disease. In this research will be done early diagnosis of heart disease by using data mining process in the form of classification. The algorithm used is K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm with Forward Selection method. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used for classification in order to obtain a decision result from the diagnosis of heart disease, while the forward selection is used as a feature selection whose purpose is to increase the accuracy value. Forward selection works by removing some attributes that are irrelevant to the classification process. In this research the result of accuracy of heart disease diagnosis with K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is 73,44%, while result of K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm accuracy with feature selection method 78,66%.

Mitochondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), signaling molecules involved in muscle contraction and calcium transfer in the heart, but they also destroy ROS to maintain a balance. Disruption to this balance can lead to elevated ROS, causing DNA and cellular damage, triggering disease.

Methods: The study was cross-sectional and time duration was from September 2016 to March 2017 at Cardiology Department of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore. The patients suffering from heart diseases were included in the study. A scheduled interview was taken through a questionnaire. Through this interview, different risk factor contributing to heart disease were observed and information was assembled. Contextual risk factor modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors were mentioned in the questionnaire. Results: Total people selected for this research study were 582 in total. In these patients, different aspects that were remarkably connected with heart disease were marital status, blood sugar, blood sugar, sleep, stress, education and number of people in the family. Other factors that showed no connection with heart disease were socioeconomic status, diet, sex, residence and smoking. Out of 582 people, 226 were negative for heart disease while 356 were positive. Out of 356 positive male and female were 206 and 150 respectively. Conclusion: Significant factors that lead to heart-related diseases are contextual risk factor and stress.

Discussion: For a child with a CHD, the practice of sports could be risky but also an opportunity to improve heart function and reach personal fulfillment. CHD have an important impact on children's quality of life, and sports participation has beneficial effects on quality of life, weight loss, and exercise capacity, in patients with CHD.

The authors indicate that an assessment of the features of coping behaviour in somatic patients, in particular those suffering from cardiovascular system diseases, is essential for improving the effectiveness of rehabilitation process. An analysis of the previous studies showed that patients with coronary heart disease are more likely to use such defence mechanisms as projection, intellectualisation, denial and coping strategies, such as repression and confrontation. The research objective was to identify the features of coping behaviour in patients with the painful form of coronary heart disease. The study involved 100 people: 50 patients with painful coronary heart disease and 50 with no history of cardiovascular disease, aged between 52 and 56 years. The main research methods included clinical interview; diagnostic methods: Life Style Index test; diagnostic method for coping strategies developed by E. Heim; Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS); Type of Person\\u2019s Attitude towards the Disease test; methods of mathematical processing and statistical evaluation. Patients with the painful form of coronary heart disease use psychological defence mechanisms more often than healthy individuals. They also use non-adaptive types of coping as compared to healthy people of the same age. The obtained data also correlate with the type of person\\u2019s attitude towards a disease: dominance of the sensitive type, the melancholic type of response, and the neurasthenic type. These features should be considered when developing a consistent approach to the rehabilitation programme with the psychocorrection of patients with coronary heart disease.\",\"published_in\":\"Psychiatria i Psychologia Kliniczna, Vol 19, Iss 4, Pp 407-410 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"coronary disease; illness behaviour; coping; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"coronary disease; illness behaviour; coping; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Zhanna Gardanova; Anastasia Grachyova; Vyacheslav Ilgov; Aleksandra Burma; Valeriia Manina; Albert Gardanov\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15557\\/PiPK.2019.0044\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"7031b99b5c26b9fb0d7decaf5d569e12818295045f96161d06d5a989b5ec53c7\",\"relevance\":22,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15557\\/PiPK.2019.0044\"},{\"id\":\"716ba080beaabbf18a34dd32b8820b0e28acce4fbdf01ffcbc812e7695a89027\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/2047487320926780; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/2047487320926780; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/2047487320926780\",\"title\":\"Susceptibility to ischaemic heart disease: Focusing on genetic variants for ATP-sensitive potassium channel beyond traditional risk factors\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Aims Ischaemic heart disease is classically associated with coronary artery disease.

Methods In this prospective nested case\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093control study based on the Swedish Twin Registry, 41,463 twin individuals who were aged \\u00e2\\u0089\\u00a540 and heart disease-free were followed up for 16\\u00c2 years (from 1998 to 2014) to detect incident heart disease. Type 2 diabetes was ascertained from self-report, the National Patient Registry and glucose-lowering medication use. Heart disease diagnosis (including coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and onset age were identified from the National Patient Registry. Healthy lifestyle-related factors consisted of being a non-smoker, no\\/mild alcohol consumption, regular physical activity and being non-overweight. Participants were divided into three groups according to the number of lifestyle-related factors: (1) unfavourable (participants who had no or only one healthy lifestyle factor); (2) intermediate (any two or three); and (3) favourable (four). Generalised estimating equation models for unmatched case\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093control design and conditional logistic regression for co-twin control design were used in data analyses. Results Of all participants, 2304 (5.5%) had type 2 diabetes at baseline. During the observation period, 9262 (22.3%) had any incident heart disease. In unmatched case\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093control analyses and co-twin control analyses, the multi-adjusted OR and 95% CI of heart disease related to type 2 diabetes was 4.36 (3.95, 4.81) and 4.89 (3.88, 6.16), respectively. The difference in ORs from unmatched case\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093control analyses vs co-twin control analyses was statistically significant (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.42, 1.73; p \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0089&lt;\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00890.001). In stratified analyses by type 2 diabetes, compared with an unfavourable lifestyle, an intermediate lifestyle or a favourable lifestyle was associated with a significant 32% (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49, 0.93) or 56% (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.30, 0.63) decrease in heart disease risk among patients with type 2 diabetes, respectively. There were significant additive and multiplicative interactions between lifestyle and type 2 diabetes on heart disease. Conclusions\\/interpretation Type 2 diabetes is associated with more than fourfold increased risk of heart disease. The association still remains statistically significant, even after fully controlling for genetic and early-life familial environmental factors. However, greater adherence to a healthy lifestyle may significantly mitigate the risk of heart disease related to type 2 diabetes.\",\"published_in\":\"Diabetologia ; ISSN 0012-186X 1432-0428\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Internal Medicine; Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism\",\"subject\":\"Internal Medicine; Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism\",\"authors\":\"Yang, Rongrong; Xu, Hui; Pedersen, Nancy L.; Li, Xuerui; Yu, Jing; Bao, Cuiping; Qi, Xiuying; Xu, Weili\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s00125-020-05324-z\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"7bdf7d3bf623ceff29b2e0e3cd468fdb1618376d071e20359b1f24166bb1584a\",\"relevance\":20,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s00125-020-05324-z\"},{\"id\":\"346a63d3286ff031de0da3ade822b6131c3b9b439bb34719f1faf1882f54aa83\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/curis.ku.dk\\/portal\\/da\\/publications\\/leftsided-heart-disease-and-risk-of-death-in-patients-with-endstage-kidney-disease-receiving-haemodialysis(c37b9c9a-709c-463d-bf3a-c29065f712c1).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12882-020-02074-3; https:\\/\\/curis.ku.dk\\/ws\\/files\\/255730762\\/s12882_020_02074_3.pdf\",\"title\":\"Left-sided heart disease and risk of death in patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving haemodialysis:An observational study\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with end-stage kidney disease on haemodialysis. The potential clinical consequence of systematic echocardiographic assessment is however not clear. In an unselected, contemporary population of patients on maintenance haemodialysis we aimed to assess: the prevalence of structural and functional heart disease, the potential therapeutic consequences of echocardiographic screening and whether left-sided heart disease is associated with prognosis. Methods: Adult chronic haemodialysis patients in two large dialysis centres had transthoracic echocardiography performed prior to dialysis and were followed prospectively. Significant left-sided heart disease was defined as moderate or severe left-sided valve disease or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\u226440%. Results: Among the 247 included patients (mean 66 years of age [95%CI 64-67], 68% male), 54 (22%) had significant left-sided heart disease. An LVEF \\u226440% was observed in 31 patients (13%) and severe or moderate valve disease in 27 (11%) patients. The findings were not previously recognized in more than half of the patients (56%) prior to the study. Diagnosis had a potential impact on management in 31 (13%) patients including for 18 (7%) who would benefit from initiation of evidence-based heart failure therapy. After 2.8 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality among patients with and without left-sided heart disease was 52 and 32% respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95 (95%CI 1.25-3.06). A multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that left-sided heart disease was an independent predictor of mortality with a HR of 1.60 (95%CI 1.01-2.55) along with age (HR per year 1.05 [95%CI 1.03-1.07]). Conclusion: Left ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate to severe valve disease are common and often unrecognized in patients with end-stage kidney failure on haemodialysis and are associated with a higher risk of death.

Particularly, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with enhanced atherosclerosis, heart muscle disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias, with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and oxidative stress playing in the background. In this topical review, we aimed to summarize current evidence on the epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, discuss the pathophysiological links between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease, illustrate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\\u2013related cardiovascular phenotypes, and finally provide a glimpse on the relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiac steatosis, mitochondrial (dys)function, and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Cardiovascular; NAFLD; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; gastroenterology\\/hepatology\",\"subject\":\"Cardiovascular; NAFLD; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; gastroenterology\\/hepatology\",\"authors\":\"Bisaccia, Giandomenico; Ricci, Fabrizio; Mantini, Cesare; Tana, Claudio; Romani, Gian Luca; Schiavone, Cosima; Gallina, Sabina\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11564\\/724134\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b39385cbb5006ea9369e73de90a0f82757df0e95d0ac9518ec774f25254e7625\",\"relevance\":18,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9f078510c0e7335635992be08c265123597e8cd89c090f0a5d9b07118d421198\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/apcz.umk.pl\\/czasopisma\\/index.php\\/JEHS\\/article\\/view\\/29230; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2391-8306; 2391-8306; doi:10.12775\\/JEHS.2020.10.02.022; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/96f76538832d4faea82aad0144e6f282\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.12775\\/JEHS.2020.10.02.022; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/96f76538832d4faea82aad0144e6f282\",\"title\":\"Dental status changes in patients with ischemic heart disease and the ways of its normalization\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Aim: increasing the effectiveness of treatment of periodontal disease in patients with ischemic heart disease Materials and methods.

In most endemic regions, affected patients present with heart failure. This statement will seek to examine the current state-of-the-art recommendations and to identify gaps in diagnosis and treatment globally that can inform strategies for reducing disease burden. Echocardiography screening based on World Heart Federation echocardiographic criteria holds promise to identify patients earlier, when prophylaxis is more likely to be effective; however, several important questions need to be answered before this can translate into public policy. Population-based registries effectively enable optimal care and secondary penicillin prophylaxis within available resources. Benzathine penicillin injections remain the cornerstone of secondary prevention. Challenges with penicillin procurement and concern with adverse reactions in patients with advanced disease remain important issues. Heart failure management, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of endocarditis, oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and prosthetic valves are vital therapeutic adjuncts. Management of health of women with unoperated and operated rheumatic heart disease before, during, and after pregnancy is a significant challenge that requires a multidisciplinary team effort. Patients with isolated mitral stenosis often benefit from percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty. Timely heart valve surgery can mitigate the progression to heart failure, disability, and death. Valve repair is preferable over replacement for rheumatic mitral regurgitation but is not available to the vast majority of patients in endemic regions. This body of work forms a foundation on which a companion document on advocacy for rheumatic heart disease has been developed. Ultimately, the combination of expanded treatment options, research, and advocacy built on existing knowledge and science provides the best opportunity to address the burden of rheumatic heart disease.\",\"published_in\":\"Circulation ; volume 142, issue 20 ; ISSN 0009-7322 1524-4539\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Physiology (medical); Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\",\"subject\":\"Physiology (medical); Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine\",\"authors\":\"Kumar, Raman Krishna; Antunes, Manuel J.; Beaton, Andrea; Mirabel, Mariana; Nkomo, Vuyisile T.; Okello, Emmy; Regmi, Prakash Raj; Rem\\u00e9nyi, Boglarka; Sliwa-H\\u00e4hnle, Karen; Z\\u00fchlke, Liesl Joanna; Sable, Craig\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1161\\/cir.0000000000000921\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"940b54c2a61cd79b26c01db4001ddabaae2cc978038f2cba773530ea00e24497\",\"relevance\":14,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1161\\/cir.0000000000000921\"},{\"id\":\"6369808e698c78cea6aef7362ab5355fd740ee64ec26d845893860960210a898\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.3483858; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3483859; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3483859; oai:zenodo.org:3483859\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3483859; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3483859\",\"title\":\"ANALYSIS OF PREVALENCE OF CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT IN POPULATION OF PAKISTAN\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a very common heart defect in the population of Pakistan. Globally, its prevalence is about 10\\/1000 live births. In Pakistan very few studies have been reported regarding the prevalence. Unfortunately, routine screening of heart of infants is not common in Pakistan. So it is very difficult to calculate exact pervasiveness of CHD in Pakistan. Objectives: Hence, this study was aimed at detecting congenital heart disease in infants in population of Abbottabad district. Methodology: This cross sectional study was conducted in DHQ Hospital Layyah during 2018 to 2019. 1683 infants who visited OPD for different complaints were assessed for congenital heart disease with the help of echocardiography. Results: out of 1683 infants, 303 (18%) were confirmed with congenital heart disease. Among the confirmed cases, 62.5 percent were males and 37.5 % were females. 78 % of the cases were between ages 1 to 3 months. The patients came with different presenting complaints like respiratory infection (48 %), underweight (31 %) and cyanosis (4%). Majority of cases were that of acyanotic congenital heart disease (98%). Ventricular septal defect (77.9%) was the most common congenital heart disease detected, followed by patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 11.5%, atrioventricular septal defect (ASD)7.9 %, tetratology of Fallot (TOF) 0.9 %, aortic stenosis2%. Conclusion: There is an utmost need to improve the efficacy of doctors of our pediatric OPDs to be able to detect heart murmur in our infant population.

We aimed to describe the regional burden, trends, and inequalities of rheumatic heart disease in the Americas. Methods: In this secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, we extracted data for deaths, prevalence of cases, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years lived with disability, and years of life lost (YLL) as measures of rheumatic heart disease burden using the GBD Results Tool. We analysed 1990\\u20132017 trends in rheumatic heart disease mortality and prevalence, quantified cross-country inequalities in rheumatic heart disease mortality, and classified countries according to rheumatic heart disease mortality in 2017 and 1990\\u20132017. Findings: GBD 2017 estimated that 3 604 800 cases of rheumatic heart disease occurred overall in the Americas in 2017, with 22 437 deaths. We showed that in 2017 rheumatic heart disease mortality in the Americas was 51% (95% UI 44\\u201359) lower (1\\u00b78 deaths per 100 000 population [95% uncertainty interval 1\\u00b77\\u20131\\u00b79] vs 3\\u00b77 deaths per 100 000 population [3\\u00b74\\u20133\\u00b79]) and prevalence was 30% (29\\u201333) lower (346\\u00b74 cases per 100 000 [334\\u00b71\\u2013359\\u00b72] vs 500\\u00b76 cases per 100 000 [482\\u00b79\\u2013519\\u00b77]) than the corresponding global estimates. DALYs were half of those globally (55\\u00b77 per 100 000 [49\\u00b78\\u201363\\u00b75] vs 118\\u00b77 per 100 000 [108\\u00b75 to 130\\u00b77]), with a 70% contribution from YLL (39\\u00b71 out of 55\\u00b77 per 100 000). A significant reduction in rheumatic heart disease mortality occurred, from a regional average of 88\\u00b74 YLL per 100 000 (95% uncertainty interval 88\\u00b72\\u201388\\u00b76) in 1990 to 38\\u00b72 (38\\u00b71\\u201338\\u00b74) in 2017, and a significant reduction in income-related inequality, from an excess of 191\\u00b77 YLL per 100 000 (68\\u00b76\\u2013314\\u00b78) between the poorest and richest countries in 1990 to 66\\u00b78 YLL per 100 000 (6\\u00b74\\u2013127\\u00b72) in 2017. Of the 37 countries studied, eight (22%) had both the highest level of premature rheumatic heart disease mortality in 2017 and the smallest reduction in this mortality between 1990 and 2017. Interpretation: The Americas have greatly reduced premature mortality due to rheumatic heart disease since 1990. These health gains were paired with a substantial reduction in the magnitude of income-related inequalities across countries, which is consistent with overall socioeconomic and health improvements observed in the Region. Countries with less favourable rheumatic heart disease situations should be targeted for strengthening of their national programmes.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a reliable, easily reproducible, medium-throughput method to culture pig and human heart slices under physiological conditions for a prolonged period of time. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel, medium-throughput biomimetic culture system that maintains viability and functionality of human and pig heart slices (300 \\u00b5m thickness) for 6 days in culture. We optimized the medium and culture conditions with continuous electrical stimulation at 1.2 Hz and oxygenation of the medium. Functional viability of these slices over 6 days was confirmed by assessing their calcium homeostasis, twitch force generation, and response to \\u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Temporal transcriptome analysis using RNAseq at day 2, 6, and 10 in culture confirmed overall maintenance of normal gene expression for up to 6 days, while over 500 transcripts were differentially regulated after 10 days. Electron microscopy demonstrated intact mitochondria and Z-disc ultra-structures after 6 days in culture under our optimized conditions. This biomimetic culture system was successful in keeping human heart slices completely viable and functionally and structurally intact for 6 days in culture. We also used this system to demonstrate the effects of a novel gene therapy approach in human heart slices. Furthermore, this culture system enabled the assessment of contraction and relaxation kinetics on isolated single myofibrils from heart slices after culture. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and optimized a reliable medium-throughput culture system for pig and human heart slices as a platform for testing the efficacy of novel heart failure therapeutics and reliable testing of cardiotoxicity in a 3D heart model.\",\"published_in\":\"642 ; 628\",\"year\":\"2019-07-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"Science & Technology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine; Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Hematology; Peripheral Vascular Disease; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; calcium; cardiotoxicity; genetic therapy; heart failure; therapeutics; DISEASE; heart slice; 1103 Clinical Sciences; 1102 Cardiorespiratory Medicine and Haematology; Cardiovascular System & Hematology\",\"subject\":\"Science & Technology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine; Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems; Hematology; Peripheral Vascular Disease; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; calcium; cardiotoxicity; genetic therapy; heart failure; therapeutics; DISEASE; heart slice;   Cardiovascular System & Hematology\",\"authors\":\"Ou, Q; Jacobson, Z; Abouleisa, R; Tang, X-L; Hindi, S; Kumar, A; Ivey, KN; Giridharan, GA; Al-Baz, A; Brittian, K; Rood, B; Lin, Y-H; Watson, SA; Perbellini, F; McKinsey, TA; Hill, BG; Jones, SP; Terracciano, CM; Bolli, R; Mohamed, TM\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10044\\/1\\/71962\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e642a4feb3ecec625cada6feb683e24d7a7c25f1b8bcbd1848f25ec1ee78d491\",\"relevance\":11,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"a862f2cba6ea654e245462c2f57ae8c0408083dbc9a5eaed1192b45b6533b4a3\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/hdl\\/11588\\/827376; journal:EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL.

This condition is very common in the population of Pakistan. Objectives of the study: The basic aim of the study is to analyze the prevalence of congenital heart defect among local population of Pakistan. Materials and methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in Lahore general hospital, Lahore during November 2018 to March 2019. The data was collected from 100 patients who visited the OPD of the hospital. The data was collected through non probability sampling technique. All infants visiting to the OPD due to any complaint would be examined for any abnormal murmur. Any abnormal heart sound case was referred for echocardiography for confirmation. Results: The data was collected 100 patients. Among the confirmed cases, 62.5 percent were males. 78 percent of the cases were between ages 1 to 3 months. The patients came with different presenting complaints as listed below. The presenting complaint was mostly respiratory infection 48 %, underweight 31 %, cyanosis (4%). It was found that the majority (98%) of cases were that of acyanotic congenital heart disease. Conclusion: It is concluded that early diagnosis and effective management has drastic improvement on prognosis of congenital heart disease.

Materials and methods. The study included 53 patients with a combination of stable ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 53 patients with stable ischemic heart disease without concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 42 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without ischemic heart disease. Cardiac rhythm disturbances during spirography were examined by synchronous determination of the external respiration function and 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring, predictors of high grade ventricular extrasystoles appearance in patients with combined pathology were calculated. Results. It has been established that 20.7 % of patients with a combination of stable ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have high grade ventricular extrasystoles (P = 0.008) during spirography, whereas among patients with isolated ischemic heart disease \\u2013 9.4 %, among people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \\u2013 7.1 %.

Among heart disease subtypes, AAMR was consistently highest for ischemic heart disease in all subgroups (race-sex, age, and region). After 2011, AAMR for heart failure and hypertensive heart disease increased at a faster rate than for other subtypes. The fastest increases in heart failure mortality were in black men (mean annual percentage change 4.9%, 95% confidence interval 4.0% to 5.8%), whereas the fastest increases in hypertensive heart disease occurred in white men (6.3%, 4.9% to 9.4%). The burden of years of potential life lost was greatest from ischemic heart disease, but black-white disparities were driven by heart failure and hypertensive heart disease. Deaths from heart disease in 2018 resulted in approximately 3.8 million potential years of life lost. Conclusions Trends in AAMR and years of potential life lost for ischemic heart disease have decelerated since 2011. For almost all other subtypes of heart disease, AAMR and years of potential life lost became stagnant or increased. Heart failure and hypertensive heart disease account for the greatest increases in premature deaths and the largest black-white disparities and have offset declines in ischemic heart disease. Early and targeted primary and secondary prevention and control of risk factors for heart disease, with a focus on groups at high risk, are needed to avoid these suboptimal trends beginning earlier in life.

Over the past three decades there have been significant advances in surgical, medical and nursing care for infants and children requiring cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease. This has meant that the number of adults with moderate and complex congenital heart disease now exceeds the number of children with the disease. This article details the background and diagnosis of congenital heart disease. It considers the implications for infants and children with congenital heart disease, as well as their parents, such as screening methods, risk factors, parental stress and psychosocial needs. This article also discusses the care of adults with congenital heart disease, including specialist monitoring and patient education.

Methods and results: Between March 2000 and June 2018, 671 consecutive episodes of infective endocarditis in adult patients were retrospectively recorded. Cases were classified according to the modified Duke classification. All adult congenital heart disease cases were managed by infectious disease specialists and adult congenital heart disease cardiologists.

Social support has been prospectively associated with prognosis among heart disease patients. Psychosocial factors such as depression and low social support are established risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with heart disease. Patients living with heart disease who receive proper social support have a better prognosis than those who do not have this support. This is a qualitative meta synthesis study. Thus, literature on social support among heart disease patients were searched and reviewed. Information about the available social support, beneficial supportive actions, social support factors contributing to heart disease, and social support challenges faced by heart disease patients were identified and discussed. The paper concludes that information regarding social support available to heart disease patients, supportive actions beneficial to heart disease patients, social support factors contributing to heart disease and social support challenges faced by heart disease patients is paramount for the development of a clinical assessment tool and support model for heart disease patients; and recommends that identified information should be used to develop a clinical assessment tool to obtain baseline social support information from every heart disease patient, to inform effective social support interventions. social support; heart disease; available support; challenges; support factors; Sociology (General); HM401-1281 Open Journal for Sociological Studies, Vol 3, Iss 2, Pp 45-52 (2019) Phillip Nhlanhla\"},{\"id\":\"908ed79be7c5c2501f06412f249d8a05be19b6fa77aa3f32081a2e49657bcffd\",\"content\":\"Towards Designing A Hierarchical Fuzzy System for Early Diagnosis of Heart Disease Heart disease may represent a range of conditions that affect our heart. Disease under heart diseases umbrella include coronary heart disease, heart attack, congestive heart failure, and congenital heart disease, is the leading cause of death. Moreover, heart disease not only attacks the elderly. In the present day, lots of younger people might be getting affected by the number of heart diseases. In order to decrease the mortality rate caused by heart disease, it is necessary for the disease, to be diagnosed at an early stage. In this paper, we have proposed the use of hierarchical fuzzy systems (HFSs) for early diagnosis of heart disease. However, to design the HFSs is challenging, especially for the complex system. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on designing a hierarchical fuzzy system to handle the complex medical application. The designed HFS consists of six key main steps implemented on heart disease. The input variables of heart disease includes shortness of breath, discomfort, pressure, heaviness, or pain in the chest, arm, or below the breastbone, fatigue, nausea, difficulties in climbing stairs, swelling in ankles, difficulty to sleep at night, irregular heartbeats, fullness, sweating, take frequent break during the day, dizzy and depressed. Additionally, the output of heart disease is to classify whether the patient is healthy or suspecting with heart disease. The study contributes to providing insight into a way of designing the HFSs, particularly for the complex medical application. Probabilities.

Design A systematic review and meta-analysis. Background Growing evidence suggests a relationship between occupational silica exposure and heart disease; however, the link between them is less clear. Data sources PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer and EMBASE were searched for articles published between 1 January 1995 and 20 June 2019. Articles that investigated the effects of occupational silica exposure on the risk of heart disease were considered. Study selection We included cohort studies, including prospective, retrospective and retroprospective studies. Data extraction and synthesis We extracted data using a piloted data collection form and conducted random-effects meta-analysis and exposure-response analysis. The meta-relative risk (meta-RR), a measure of the average ratio of heart disease rates in those with and without silica exposure, was used as an inverse variance-weighted average of relative risks from the individual studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies was used for study quality assessment. Outcome measure We calculated the risk of heart diseases such as pulmonary heart disease, ischaemic heart disease and others. Results Twenty cohort studies were included. The results suggest a significant increase in the risk of overall heart disease (meta-RR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.13). Stronger evidence of association with pulmonary heart disease was found in the risk estimate of both categories of heart disease (meta-RR=1.24, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.43) and in the exposure-response analysis (meta-RR=1.39, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.62). Our subgroup analyses also revealed that the statistical heterogeneity among studies could be attributed mainly to the diversity in reference group, occupation and study quality score. Conclusions Silica-exposed workers are at an increased risk for overall heart disease, especially pulmonary heart disease. Further research is needed to better clarify the relationship between occupational silica exposure and ischaemic heart disease. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019124673.

Ischemic heart disease is one of the most frequent causes of heart failure and it is normally attributed to coronary artery disease, defined by the presence of one or more obstructive plaques, which determine a reduced coronary blood flow, causing myocardial ischemia and consequent heart failure. However, coronary obstruction is only an element of a complex pathophysiological process that leads to myocardial ischemia. In the literature, attention paid to the role of microcirculation, in the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and heart failure, is growing. Coronary microvascular dysfunction determines an inability of coronary circulation to satisfy myocardial metabolic demands, due to the imbalance of coronary blood flow regulatory mechanisms, including ion channels, leading to the development of hypoxia, fibrosis and tissue death, which may determine a loss of myocardial function, even beyond the presence of atherosclerotic epicardial plaques.

The underlying mechanisms, however, remain uncertain. AIMS: To examine the association between cyanotic congenital heart disease and internalising problems and assess whether parenting stress mediates this association. METHOD: The study sample was 699 children and adolescents (aged 2-17 years) with congenital heart disease (253 with cyanotic congenital heart disease and 446 with acyanotic congenital heart disease) in Taiwan. The Child Behavior Checklist and the Parenting Stress Index were used to assess internalising problems and parenting stress, respectively. A series of multiple regression models was conducted using the SPSS PROCESS procedure to test the association between types of congenital heart disease and internalising problems and the mediating role of parenting stress. A bootstrapping approach was applied to determine the significance of mediation. RESULTS: Compared with acyanotic congenital heart disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease was associated with increased levels of internalising problems (B=2.52, P<0.01), and this association was mediated by parenting stress (B=0.97, 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval 0.24, 1.75). In particular, parents of children with cyanotic congenital heart disease reported significantly more parenting stress compared with parents of children with acyanotic congenital heart disease (B=4.63, P<0.01), which contributed to elevated levels of internalising problems in the offspring (B=0.21, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Cyanotic congenital heart disease conferred risks for internalising problems in children and adolescents, and this association was mediated by parenting stress. Interventions to decrease internalising problems in children and adolescents with cyanotic congenital heart disease may be more effective by targeting parenting stress.

Completed as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017, this study aimed to provide comprehensive estimates of congenital heart disease mortality, prevalence, and disability by age for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Methods: Mortality estimates were generated for aggregate congenital heart disease and non-fatal estimates for five subcategories (single ventricle and single ventricle pathway congenital heart anomalies; severe congenital heart anomalies excluding single ventricle heart defects; critical malformations of great vessels, congenital valvular heart disease, and patent ductus arteriosus; ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect; and other congenital heart anomalies), for 1990 through to 2017. All available global data were systematically analysed to generate congenital heart disease mortality estimates (using Cause of Death Ensemble modelling) and prevalence estimates (DisMod-MR 2\\u00b71). Systematic literature reviews of all types of congenital anomalies to capture information on prevalence, associated mortality, and long-term health outcomes on congenital heart disease informed subsequent disability estimates. Findings: Congenital heart disease caused 261 247 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 216 567\\u2013308 159) globally in 2017, a 34\\u00b75% decline from 1990, with 180 624 deaths (146 825\\u2013214 178) being among infants (aged <1 years). Congenital heart disease mortality rates declined with increasing Socio-demographic Index (SDI); most deaths occurred in countries in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. The prevalence rates of congenital heart disease at birth changed little temporally or by SDI, resulting in 11 998 283 (10 958 658\\u201313 123 888) people living with congenital heart disease globally, an 18\\u00b77% increase from 1990 to 2017, and causing a total of 589 479 (287 200\\u2013973 359) years lived with disability. Interpretation: Congenital heart disease is a large, rapidly emerging global problem in child health. Without the ability to substantially alter the prevalence of congenital heart disease, interventions and resources must be used to improve survival and quality of life. Our findings highlight the large global inequities in congenital heart disease and can serve as a starting point for policy changes to improve screening, treatment, and data collection.

However, the impact of this reactivation on the genome-wide regulatory landscape in heart disease has remained obscure. Here we show that pervasive epigenomic changes occur in heart disease, with thousands of regulatory sequences reacquiring fetal-like chromatin signatures. We used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq targeting a histone modification associated with active transcriptional enhancers to generate genome-wide enhancer maps from left ventricle tissue from 18 healthy controls and 18 individuals with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Healthy individuals had a highly reproducible epigenomic landscape, consisting of more than 31,000 predicted heart enhancers. In contrast, we observed reproducible disease-associated gains or losses of activity at more than 7,500 predicted heart enhancers. Next, we profiled human fetal heart tissue by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. Comparison with adult tissues revealed that the heart disease epigenome and transcrip-tome both shift toward a fetal-like state, with 3,400 individual enhancers sharing fetal regulatory properties. Our results demonstrate widespread epigenomic changes in DCM, and we provide a comprehensive data resource ( http:\\/\\/heart.lbl.gov ) for the mechanistic exploration of heart disease etiology.

They have various types including vascular, ischemic, and hypertensive heart disease. A large number of medical features are reported for patients in the Electronic Health Records (EHR) that allow physicians to diagnose and monitor heart disease. We collected a dataset from Medica Norte Hospital in Mexico that includes 800 records and 141 indicators such as age, weight, glucose, blood pressure rate, and clinical symptoms. Distribution of the collected records is very unbalanced on the different types of heart disease, where 17% of records have hypertensive heart disease, 16% of records have ischemic heart disease, 7% of records have mixed heart disease, and 8% of records have valvular heart disease. Herein, we propose an ensemble-learning framework of different neural network models, and a method of aggregating random under-sampling. To improve the performance of the classification algorithms, we implement a data preprocessing step with features selection. Experiments were conducted with unidirectional and bidirectional neural network models and results showed that an ensemble classifier with a BiLSTM or BiGRU model with a CNN model had the best classification performance with accuracy and F1-score between 91% and 96% for the different types of heart disease. These results are competitive and promising for heart disease dataset. We showed that ensemble-learning framework based on deep models could overcome the problem of classifying an unbalanced heart disease dataset. Our proposed framework can lead to highly accurate models that are adapted for clinical real data and diagnosis use. heart disease classification; neural network; ensemble-learning model; under-sampling; features selection; deep learning; Information technology; T58.5-58.64 Information, Vol 11, Iss 207, p 207 (2020) Asma Baccouche; Begonya Garcia-Zapirain; Cristian Castillo Olea; Adel Elmaghraby\"},{\"id\":\"3e260bb6ff71cf22ec6e6e648610ce8718b6deaeb8777f49b80475ef8c19b439\",\"content\":\"A scoping review and mapping exercise comparing the content of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) across heart disease-specific scales Abstract Background Over the past decade, the importance of person-centered care has led to increased interest in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). In cardiovascular care, selecting an appropriate PROM for clinical use or research is challenging because multimorbidity is often common in patients. The aim was therefore to provide an overview of heart-disease specific PROMs and to compare the content of those outcomes using a bio-psycho-social framework of health. Methods A scoping review of heart disease-specific PROMs, including arrhythmia\\/atrial fibrillation, congenital heart disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and valve diseases was conducted in PubMed (January 2018). All items contained in the disease-specific PROMs were mapped to WHO\\u2019s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) according to standardized linking rules. Results A total of 34 PROMs (heart diseases in general n = 5; cardiac arrhythmia n = 6; heart failure n = 14; ischemic heart disease n = 9) and 147 ICF categories were identified. ICF categories covered Body functions (n = 61), Activities & Participation (n = 69), and Environmental factors (n = 17). Most items were about experienced problems of Body functions and less often about patients\\u2019 daily activities, and most PROMs were specifically developed for heart failure and no PROM were identified for valve disease or congenital heart disease.

Determinant factors, characteristics, and risk factors influence the incidence of heart disease in pregnancy, so the early detection of determinant factors can reduce the incidence of heart disease in pregnancy. This study aimed to find the relationship between determinant factors of maternal and fetal outcomes with the severity of heart disease in pregnancy.Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional analytical study. We used 342 cases of heart disease in pregnancy that were recorded in medical records at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia, from January 2014 to December 2018. The data were grouped based on the severity of heart disease according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. The relationship of maternal determinant factors with the severity of heart disease was analyzed based on the NYHA classification.Results: Maternal occupation was significantly associated with a higher risk of NYHA class III\\u2013IV heart disease. Most of the patients with NYHA class III-IV were housewives. The severity of heart disease was also influenced by severe preeclampsia (p< 0.05) as a risk factor. Maternal outcome with heart disease of severity NYHA class III\\u2013IV was worse than with NYHA class I\\u2013II. The risk of maternal death was higher, and the mother\\u2019s length of stay in hospital and her need for monitoring were also increased. There were no significant differences in the outcome of the fetus, but the incidence of fetal mortality increased in patients with heart disease severity III\\u2013IV.Conclusion: Maternal determinant factors did not correlate with the severity of heart disease in pregnancy. Maternal outcomes were worse with increasing severity of heart disease.

Chronic kidney disease leads to early damage to the heart and blood vessels with the development of heart failure. The manifestation of one disease leads to the progression of another, since chronic heart failure is a condition in which the myocardium and kidneys are pathogenetically closely related to each other. The purpose of the work was to identify early predictors of chronic heart failure development and progression in patients with chronic kidney disease. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of case histories of 322 patients with chronic kidney disease stages 1\\u20134 was carried out. Patients were divided into two groups: the main group included those with chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure (n = 50), the comparison group \\u2014 patients with chronic kidney disease, but without chronic heart failure (n = 50). We studied the data of clinical, laboratory and instrumental examination. The obtained results were processed statistically. Results. Patients with chronic kidney disease and signs of heart failure had an increased body mass index, leg swelling, and stage 2 hypertension degrees 1\\u20132. The electrocardiograpy revealed a rhythm disturbance by the type of paroxysmal tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. A decrease in hemoglobin level, filtration function of the kidneys, as well as manifestations of dyslipidemia were detected. Conclusions. Diastolic hypertension, anemia and increased total cholesterol can be considered as early predictors of chronic heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. Consequently, the risk of heart failure development and progression increases with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml\\/min.

With this mixed pathology, the course of both coronary heart disease and COPD worsens and the risk of adverse events increases. Diagnostic-treatment and rehabilitation programs in combination with coronary heart disease and COPD complication. This requires a comprehensive approach and consideration of the pathogenesis features of each disease. In coronary heart disease, especially in older age, diagnostic measures should include targeted detection of COPD and vice versa. Conclusions. Despite numerous studies of the IHD-COPD tandem, the issues of prevalence, course, and life expectancy in older patients with this comorbid pathology have not been adequately addressed. Causes of comorbidity are common features of pathogenesis, clinical symptoms and risk factors. At the same time, the combination of coronary heart disease and COPD raises debating questions about diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation, especially in the elderly and aging. It is in this direction that the focus of future research on the combination of IHD and COPD should be directed. Purposeful study will help to develop directions for correction, prognosis and prevention of this comorbid pathology, especially in elderly patients ischemic heart disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; prevalence; comorbidity; old age ScienceRise: Medical Science 3(36) 20-24 Galina Voinarovska; Ervin Asanov\"},{\"id\":\"39a8bdcb795afe04686992d7311d5ec54cbfb2b36854baa295732d0a473c49b0\",\"content\":\"COMPARISON AND EVALUATION DATA MINING TECHNIQUES IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF HEART DISEASE Heart disease is one of the biggest health problems in the world because of high mortality and morbidity caused by the disease. The use of data mining on medical data brought valuable and effective life achievements and can enhance medical knowledge to make necessary decisions. Data mining plays an important role in the field of medical science to solve health problems and diagnose ailments in critical conditions and in normal conditions. For this reason, in this paper, data mining techniques are used to diagnose heart disease from a dataset that includes 200 samples from different patients. Techniques used to diagnose heart disease include Bagging, AdaBoostM1, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, RBF Network, IBK, and NNge that all the techniques used to diagnose heart disease use Weka tool. Then these techniques are compared to determine which is more accurate in the diagnosis of heart disease that according to the results, it was found that the RBF Network with the accuracy of 88.2% is the most accurate classification in the diagnosis of heart disease.

By conventions, it is equated with atherosclerotic plaque due to flow-limiting obstruction in large\\u2013medium sized coronary arteries. However, clinical, angiographic and autoptic findings suggest a multifaceted pathophysiology for ischemic heart disease and just some cases are caused by severe or complicated atherosclerotic plaques. Currently there is no well-defined assessment of ischemic heart disease pathophysiology that satisfies all the observations and sometimes the underlying mechanism to everyday ischemic heart disease ward cases is misleading. In order to better examine this complicated disease and to provide future perspectives, it is important to know and analyze the pathophysiological mechanisms that underline it, because ischemic heart disease is not always determined by atherosclerotic plaque complication. Therefore, in order to have a more complete comprehension of ischemic heart disease we propose an overview of the available pathophysiological paradigms, from plaque activation to microvascular dysfunction.

Heart valve operation is the predominant treatment strategy for heart valve disease. This study analyzed the death risk from heart valve disease with respect to the frequency of heart valve operation and other operations in patients with mitral valve disease. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective nationwide population-based case\\u2013control study using a claims dataset from Taiwan\\u2019s National Health Insurance Research Database. The case and control groups enrolled mitral valve disease patients from 2002 to 2013 who had either underwent an heart valve operation procedure or not, respectively. Conditional logistic regression was estimated the odds ratios (ORs) associated with various risk factors for heart valve operation-related death, including other operations and comorbidities. Results A total of 25,964 patients with mitral valve disease were recruited for the study and divided into heart valve operation (600 patients) and non-heart valve operation (25,364 patients) groups. After matching, a total of 1800 non-heart valve operation patients were selected for final analysis. Heart valve operation was associated with decreased risk of death (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.439), but operations related to other cardiovascular disease (CVD, aOR 3.691), respiratory conditions (aOR 3.210), and the urinary system (aOR 1.925) were associated with increased risk of death for patients with mitral valve disease. Patients with mitral valve disease and diabetes (aOR 1.505), chronic kidney disease (CKD, aOR 3.760), or emphysema (aOR 2.623) also had a higher risk of death. Patients who underwent more heart valve operations had a lower risk of death from mitral valve disease, but patients who underwent more other operations had a higher risk of death from mitral valve disease. Conclusions The death risk for patients with mitral valve disease patients could be lowered by more frequently performing heart valve operations. However, the risk of death is increased for patients with mitral valve disease who more frequently undergo other operations, chiefly those for other CVD system, respiratory conditions, and urinary system, or have comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and emphysema.

In cardiovascular care, selecting an appropriate PROM for clinical use or research is challenging because multimorbidity is often common in patients. The aim was therefore to provide an overview of heart-disease specific PROMs and to compare the content of those outcomes using a bio-psycho-social framework of health. Methods A scoping review of heart disease-specific PROMs, including arrhythmia\\/atrial fibrillation, congenital heart disease, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and valve diseases was conducted in PubMed (January 2018). All items contained in the disease-specific PROMs were mapped to WHO\\u2019s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) according to standardized linking rules. Results A total of 34 PROMs (heart diseases in general n = 5; cardiac arrhythmia n = 6; heart failure n = 14; ischemic heart disease n = 9) and 147 ICF categories were identified. ICF categories covered Body functions ( n = 61), Activities & Participation ( n = 69), and Environmental factors ( n = 17). Most items were about experienced problems of Body functions and less often about patients\\u2019 daily activities, and most PROMs were specifically developed for heart failure and no PROM were identified for valve disease or congenital heart disease. Conclusions Our results motivate and provide information to develop comprehensive PROMs that consider activity and participation by patients with various types of heart disease.

It has therefore been the subject of a tremendous amount of research, often with small-animal models such as rodents. However, the physiology of the human heart differs significantly from that of the rodent heart, underscoring the need for clinically relevant models to study heart disease. Here, we present a protocol to model ischemic heart disease using cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS-CMs) and to quantify the damage and functional impairment of the ischemic cardiomyocytes. Exposure to 2% oxygen without glucose and serum increases the percentage of injured cells, which is indicated by staining of the nucleus with propidium iodide, and decreases cellular viability. These conditions also decrease the contractility of hiPS-CMs as confirmed by displacement vector field analysis of microscopic video images. This protocol may furthermore provide a convenient method for personalized drug screening by facilitating the use of hiPS cells from individual patients. Therefore, this model of ischemic heart disease, based on iPS-CMs of human origin, can provide a useful platform for drug screening and further research on ischemic heart disease.

Methods: In total, 23,498 monozygotic and 39,540 same-sex dizygotic twins from the Danish Twin Registry were followed from 1977 to 2011 in the Danish National Patient Registry for ischemic heart disease and stroke. Time-to-event analyses accounting for censoring and competing risk of death were used to estimate familial risk (casewise concordance relative to the cumulative incidence) and heritability of ischemic heart disease, stroke, and the co-occurrence by age. Results: During follow-up, we observed 5561 and 4186 twin individuals with ischemic heart disease and stroke respectively, with 936 twin pairs concordant for ischemic heart disease and stroke. Familial risks were significant for both, with higher cumulative risks in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins. Estimates for heritability were significant for ischemic heart disease as well as for stroke diagnosed after the age of 80. The casewise concordance of ischemic heart disease in twins whose co-twin was diagnosed with stroke did not differ for monozygotic and dizygotic twins; however, from age 55 it was 10% higher than the cumulative risk in the overall twin cohort and was 25% higher at age 90. A similar pattern was seen for stroke following the co-twin\\u2019s ischemic heart disease. Conclusions: As in previous studies, we found a higher heritability of ischemic heart disease than of stroke. There was a significant familial risk but no heritability for the co-occurrence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. The co-occurrence is therefore likely due to other shared familial than genetic factors, highlighting that preventive initiatives should target families rather than individuals.

learning approach for the prediction of heart disease risk Abstract: According to the world health organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, and identifying those at risk can help prevent sudden deaths. Some computational methods have been proposed to predict the patient\\u2019s heart disease risk. Meanwhile, the accurate prediction of diseases is a critical aspect of machine learning and to further enhance the classification of heart disease risk, this paper proposes an improved ensemble learning approach. The mean of the data columns is used to partition the dataset into smaller subsets, and then a classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm is applied to model each partition. Randomization is introduced during the data partitioning. The resulting ensemble produces a robust model for the prediction of heart disease risk. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the Cleveland and Framingham heart disease datasets are used. When compared with other machine learning methods and some recent scholarly works, the proposed method showed significant improvement.

Its main impact is on the cardiovascular system, producing myocardial damage that frequently results in heart failure. Pathogenic pathways are mainly related to inmunoinflamatory reactions in the myocardium and, less frequently, in the gastrointestinal tract. The heart usually shows fibrosis, producing dilatation and damage of the electrogenic cardiac system. These changes result in cardiomyopathy with heart failure and frequent cardiac arrhythmias and heart blocks. Diagnosis of the disease must include a lab test to detect the parasite or its immune reactions and the usual techniques to evaluate cardiac function. Therapeutic management of Chagas heart failure does not differ significantly from the most common treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy, with special focus on arrhythmias and several degrees of heart block. Heart transplantation is reserved for end-stage cases. Major international scientific organisations are delivering recommendations for prevention and early diagnosis. This article provides an analysis of epidemiology, prevention, treatment and the relationship between Chagas disease and heart failure.

This study describes the reported cases of congenital heart disease in Portugal in 2015 regarding antenatal diagnosis, cardiac defect, and presence of other congenital anomalies\\/chromosomal abnormalities. These indicators are compared in live births and medical pregnancy terminations. Additionally, postnatal deaths were characterized. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Congenital heart disease data derived from the 2015 Portuguese National Registry of Congenital Birth Defects were analyzed. The prevalence rates per 1000 births were assessed by the chi-square test of independence. RESULTS: The prevalence of congenital heart disease in this study was 5\\/1000 live-births (339 live-births, 20% with critical defects). The most common defects were ventricular septal defect (38%), atrial septal defect (15%), aortic coarctation (7%), tetralogy of Fallot (7%) and pulmonary stenosis (5%). One third of the live births had antenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease. In the live-births with critical congenital heart disease, 54% had antenatal diagnosis and 14% were diagnosed at birth. There were records of 84 pregnancy terminations; 49% had critical defects, 75% had non-cardiac congenital anomalies and 40% had chromosomal abnormalities. There were 15 postnatal deaths recorded (3.4% mortality rate), associated with prematurity\\/low birthweight, critical congenital heart disease, other non-cardiac congenital anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities. DISCUSSION: The data analysis revealed a prevalence of congenital heart disease in this study of 5\\/1000 births (inferior to other international studies), with a distribution per type of anomaly similar to that reported in previously published work. There were significant regional differences that need further studying. CONCLUSION: These results are paramount to characterize the Portuguese scenario and improve Healthcare planning. It is important to improve reporting in the Portuguese National Registry of Congenital Birth Defects. ; publishersversion ; published Heart Defects; Congenital \\/ epidemiology; Portugal; Registries; Medicine(all)  Melo, Isabel Saraiva; Braz, Paula; Roquette, Rita; Sousa, Paulo; Nunes, Carla; Dias, Carlos\"},{\"id\":\"43a2a550a77f471f01b017157785e96556977e9ca042425ceeacfdc6108bd5c7\",\"content\":\"The spectrum of heart disease among adults at the Bamenda Regional Hospital, North west Cameroon: a semi urban setting Abstract Objective We sought to determine the spectrum of heart diseases among adult patients at the Bamenda Regional Hospital in the North West Region of Cameroon.

Due to the heterogeneity of ACHD and secondary complications, risk profiles are, however, not uniform. This document aims to give an overview of relevant data and outline our pragmatic approach to disease prevention and management. Based on anatomy and additional physiological factors including symptoms, exercise capacity, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis, we propose a pragmatic approach to categorising patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk groups. We regard especially patients with complex cyanotic conditions, those with palliated univentricular hearts, heart failure, severe valvular disease or pulmonary hypertension as high-risk patients. To avoid infection, we recommend self-isolation and exemption from work for these cohorts. Infected ACHD patients with low or moderate risk and without signs of deterioration may be remotely followed and cared for at home while in self isolation. High-risk patients or those with signs of respiratory or cardiovascular impairment require admission ideally at a tertiary ACHD centre. Especially patients with complex, cyanotic disease, heart failure and arrhythmias require particular attention. Treatment in patients with cyanotic heart disease should be guided by the relative degree of desaturation compared with baseline and lactate levels rather than absolute oxygen saturation levels. Patients with right heart dilatation or dysfunction are potentially at increased risk of right heart failure as mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome can lead to increase in pulmonary arterial pressures.

As a result of improved diagnostic and reparative techniques, congenital heart diseases are becoming a significant problem for women of childbearing age. Nowadays, more pregnant women in the West are being diagnosed with an acquired heart disease because of the tendency to delay childbearing and increasing age-related risk of developing complications of hypertension, diabetes, obesity and other diseases. According to the Lithuanian Health Information Centre, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases in pregnancy is decreasing in Lithuania, from 1.4% in 2014 to 1% in 2016 (1). Heart diseases can aggravate maternal adaptive capabilities and complications that pose a threat to mother and foetus can occur. Management of such conditions presents a serious therapeutic challenge to multidisciplinary team. The aim of this article is to discuss the course of pregnancy and peculiarities of maternal and foetal care in a woman with hemodynamically significant heart disease. Materials and methods. We present a clinical case of a 30-year-old nuliparous woman who was diagnosed with mitral valve disease with critical stenosis, grade II\\/III mitral valve insufficiency, moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension, heart failure stage C, and NYHA functional class II. Results and conclusions. Pregnancy in conjunction with heart disease is a complicated condition that requires multidisciplinary prenatal care (consisting of an obstetrician gynaecologist, cardiologist, anaesthesiologist). Low molecular weight heparins should be the first choice medication for antithrombotic prophylaxis. Since pregnancy can aggravate a heart disease, preconception counselling and evaluation of the heart function are recommended. pregnancy; heart disease; valvular heart disease; mitral valve insufficiency; heart failure Acta medica Lituanica; Vol 25 No 3 (2018); 140-150 ; 2029-4174 ; 1392-0138 Bu\\u017einskien\\u0117, Diana; Dom\\u017ea, Gintautas; Dulko, Justyna; Ol\\u0161auskait\\u0117, Migl\\u0117; Dr\\u0105sutien\\u0117, Gra\\u017eina; Liekien\\u0117, Daina\"},{\"id\":\"01764234e4b8ca3e0a5e8ed804cb5402b726746291c00138eb2f3c27faff6ca3\",\"content\":\"Left ventricular hypertrophy in athletes: How to differentiate between hypertensive heart disease and athlete\\u2019s heart Athlete\\u2019s heart is typically accompanied by a remodelling of the cardiac chambers induced by exercise. However, although competitive athletes are commonly considered healthy, they can be affected by cardiac disorders characterised by an increase in left ventricular mass and wall thickness, such as hypertension.

To understand the splitting of the second heart sound, it is useful to understand the concepts of hangout interval and ejection time. Differential diagnosis of S2 split include opening snap, third heart sound, and pericardial knock. Variations of second heart sound may involve intensity or variations of split. Variations of split can be single heart sound, wide split, wide fixed split, or paradoxical splitting.Interpretation of second heart sound in congenital heart disease provides information about the presence and position of semilunar valves.

The cardiovascular clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism are palpitation, systolic hypertension, fatigue, or with the basis of existing heart disease, angina or heart failure. In men, the disease is more frequently to develop into congestive heart failure than in women, thus more exploration is needed. This case report discussed a 42-year-old male patient who was admitted to the emergency department due to palpitations, shortness of breath aggravated with activity and lie down position, and alleviated with resting, cough with white sputum, epigastric pain, and constipation since the past 3 days. He was diagnosed with a history of hyperthyroidism and congestive heart disease 1 year ago and routinely consumed propylthiouracil (PTU). He had a history of herniotomy 10 days before admission. The patient did not have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hypercholesterolemia. The patient has a smoking habit of up to 3 packs\\/day since a teenager. The patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroid heart disease (congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary heart disease) with comorbid of electrolyte imbalance, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient was treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and was given oxygen therapy, crystalloid infusion, antithyroid drug, beta-blocker, diuretics, digitalis, anti-angina, anti-thrombotic, and adjunct therapy. The patient was treated for 8 days in ICU, followed by 2 days in the ward with a good outcome. Early detection and intervention followed by close monitoring is key management for the patient with hyperthyroid heart disease, especially in a male patient, to achieve a better outcome.

Methods: One-hundred-eighty children (aged 1-15 years) with underlying heart disease were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. The heart failures were categorized based on the Ross classification into 2 groups, non-heart failure (Ross classification I) and heart failure (Ross classification II-IV). The NT\\u2010proBNP level was determined and chest radiograph was done in posteroanterior upright position for CT ratio. Results: The mean NT-proBNP level was 223.1 pg\\/ml (+180.3) and a mean CT ratio was 53.6% (+5.6) in the non-heart failure group. The mean NT-proBNP level was 1,054 pg\\/ml (+1,840.3) and a mean CT ratio was 58.6% (+6.1) in heart failure group. There was a significantly positive correlation between heart failure symptoms and the level of NT-proBNP and CT ratio. In this study, the cut-off value of NT-proBNP for heart failure was more than 400 pg\\/ml (OR 6.97, ROC 0.694, sensitivity 52.6%, specificity 86.3%) and CT ratio more than 55% (OR 3.57, ROC 0.654, sensitivity 68%, specificity 62.8%). Conclusion: In pediatric heart diseases, there are strong positive correlations between heart failure with both NT-proBNP and CT ratio. These correlations help in the diagnosis of heart failure. NT-proBNP level more than 400 pg\\/ml and CT ratio more than 55% are indicative of heart failure in our population.

Marginalization related Diminished Returns (MDRs) refer to smaller health benefits of high SES for racial and ethnic minorities compared to the majority group. It is still unknown, however, if MDRs also apply to the effects of education on heart disease. Purpose: Using a nationally representative sample, we explored racial\\/ethnic variation in the link between educational attainment and heart disease among American adults. Methods: We analyzed data (n=25,659) from a nationally representative survey of American adults in 2013. The first wave of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health - Adult (PATH-Adult) study was used. The independent variable was education (college graduate, high school graduate, less than a high school diploma). The dependent variable was any heart disease. Age and gender were the covariates. Race, as well as ethnicity, were the moderators. Logistic regressions were used to analyze the data. Results: Individuals with higher educational attainment had lower odds of heart disease. Race and ethnicity showed statistically significant interactions with education, suggesting that the protective effect of higher education on reducing odds of heart disease was smaller for Hispanic and Black people than for non-Hispanic and White individuals. Conclusion: Education reduces the risk of heart disease better among non-Hispanic Whites than for Hispanics and Blacks. Therefore, we may expect a disproportionately higher than expected risk of heart disease in Hispanics and Blacks with high educational attainment. Future research should test if the presence of high levels of environmental and behavioral risk factors contribute to the high risk of heart disease in highly educated Black and Hispanic Americans. Policymakers should not reduce health inequalities to just gaps in SES because disparities are present across SES levels, with high SES Blacks and Hispanics remaining at risk of health problems.

Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death in the majority of developed countries, including Russia. It determines the importance of elaboration of individual risk prediction of ischemic heart disease for primary prevention.Aim: to develop a strategy for predicting the ischemic heart disease in coal industry workers.Materials and methods. Ischemic heart disease incidence and its risk factors were studied in 196 coalmine workers (sinkers, stope miners). Rose Questionnaire, daily ECG monitoring and bicycle ergometry were used to detect angina. The indices of lipid metabolism, hemostatic system, the level of homocysteine, uric acid, C-reactive protein, constitutional-morphological type by Rees \\u2013 Eysenck, genetic markers of blood groups of AB0, P and MN systems were studied.When elaborating the prognostic system, we used the Bayes method. A prognostic coefficient was calculated for each factor. Prediction of ischemic heart disease was carried out according to the sum of prognostic coefficients.Results. Ischemic heart disease was detected in 18 (9.2 %) miners. According to the above mentioned indices, a medical technology was elaborated to predict the ischemic heart disease, based on the determination of the most significant risk markers: age, work experience in harmful working conditions, type A behavior, arterial hypertension, fasting hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, decrease in the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, increase in the value of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, hyperfibrinogenemia, increase in the level of soluble fibrin monomer complexes and C-reactive protein, abdominal obesity, hypersthenic constitutional-morphological type by Rees \\u2013 Eysenck, genetic markers of blood groups of AB0, P and MN systems.Conclusion.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW:To assess current management strategies for advanced heart failure in adults with congenital heart disease, including heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support. RECENT FINDINGS:Current data demonstrate that adults with CHD generally experience higher short-term mortality after heart transplantation and MCS implantation, but enjoy superior long-term survival. Such patients are nonetheless less likely to receive a transplant than non-ACHD peers due to a variety of factors, including lack of applicability of current listing criteria to HF in ACHD. MCS is underutilized in ACHD, but provides similar quality of life benefits for ACHD and non-ACHD patients alike. Heart failure in ACHD is complex and difficult to treat, and both heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support are often challenging to implement in this patient population. However, long-term results are encouraging, and existing data supports increasing use of MCS and transplant earlier in their disease course. Multidisciplinary care is critical to success in these complex patients.

Over the last years, cardiopulmonary exercise test has gained importance in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of congenital heart diseases, as has already occurred in HF. Objective: To describe the behavior of hemodynamic, metabolic and ventilatory parameters in response to exercise in adults with congenital heart disease. Methods: Observational cross-sectional study evaluating 31 adults with congenital acyanotic or cyanotic heart disease, treated clinically, surgically or percutaneously, referred for cardiopulmonary exercise test. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed. Results: Patients aged 35.7 \\u00b1 14.2 years were included. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was 44.86 \\u00b1 18.01% of predicted at peak exercise and 36.92 \\u00b1 12.93% of predicted maximal VO2 at anaerobic threshold. We found an oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) of 1.49 \\u00b1 0.89 (61.43 \\u00b1 26.63% of predicted), oxygen pulse of 58.90 \\u00b1 22.24% and increment in systolic arterial pressure during exercise was 31.42 \\u00b1 21.60 mmHg. Conclusion: Adults with congenital heart disease had similar responses to heart failure patients during exercise - reduced aerobic capacity, ventilatory inefficiency for oxygen consumption and limited inotropic response to exercise, characterized by reduced oxygen pulse and small increase in systolic arterial pressure.

Ischemic heart disease is one of the most frequent causes of heart failure and it is normally attributed to coronary artery disease, defined by the presence of one or more obstructive plaques, which determine a reduced coronary blood flow, causing myocardial ischemia and consequent heart failure. However, coronary obstruction is only an element of a complex pathophysiological process that leads to myocardial ischemia. In the literature, attention paid to the role of microcirculation, in the pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and heart failure, is growing. Coronary microvascular dysfunction determines an inability of coronary circulation to satisfy myocardial metabolic demands, due to the imbalance of coronary blood flow regulatory mechanisms, including ion channels, leading to the development of hypoxia, fibrosis and tissue death, which may determine a loss of myocardial function, even beyond the presence of atherosclerotic epicardial plaques. For this reason, ion channels may represent the link among coronary microvascular dysfunction, ischemic heart disease and consequent heart failure. heart failure; ischemic heart disease; microcirculation; ion channel; coronary artery disease; coronary microvascular dysfunction; Biology (General); QH301-705.5; Chemistry; QD1-999 International Journal of Molecular Sciences, Vol 21, Iss 3167, p 3167 (2020) Paolo Severino; Andrea D\\u2019Amato; Mariateresa Pucci; Fabio Infusino; Lucia Ilaria Birtolo; Marco Valerio Mariani; Carlo Lavalle; Viviana Maestrini; Massimo Mancone; Francesco Fedele\"},{\"id\":\"a2149159d5dee3456111de14f00cf66e5d84c14404d676aa430082aa462c0648\",\"content\":\"FEATURES OF THE COURSE OF THE CHRONIC RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE IN MODERN CONDITIONS Yakimenko \\u0415. \\u0410., Zakatova L.

; Appropriate care behaviors of parents for children with congenital heart disease can relieve various complications their children\\u2019s disease. With proper care, these ill children can also be treated through heart surgery as physician\\u2019s plan. This descriptive correlational study aimed to explore care behaviors of parents on preventing respiratory infection in children with congenital heart disease, and the relationship between knowledge, self-efficacy and care behaviors of parents on preventing respiratory tract infection in children with congenital heart disease. The conceptual framework of this study based on literature review of the researcher. The study sample consisted of 102 parents of children aged 1to- 6 years old with acyanotic congenital heart disease who were scheduled for heart surgery. Participants were recruited through the inclusion criteria during follow-up appointments at the out-patient cardiac clinic of tertiary public hospitals in Northern Thailand. Data were collected from January 2014 to March 2014. Research instruments included: 1) the Demographic Data of Parents and Children with Congenital Heart Disease record form, 2) the Parental Knowledge of Care Behaviors to Prevent Respiratory Infection in Children with Congenital Heart Disease Questionnaire, 3) the Parental Self-efficacy of Care Behaviors on Preventing Respiratory Tract Infection in Children with Congenital Heart Disease Questionnaire, and 4) the Parental Care Behaviors to Prevent Respiratory Infection in Children with Congenital Heart Disease Questionnaire. The last three questionnaires had a content validity index of .92, .83 and .93, respectively with reliability rates of .78, .97 and .89 respectively. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Spearman statistical correlation. The study findings showed that: All parents had high levels of care behaviors on preventing respiratory infection in children with congenital heart disease. Within each dimension, all parents showed high levels of care behaviors in providing the suitable nutrition, getting immunizations, and isolation and contact precaution. Additionally, 98% of the sample possessed a high level of ability in administrating medication to prevent congestive heart failure. Parental care behaviors had a statistically significant positive relationship to knowledge and self-efficacy. The relationship was at a moderate level (r = .367, p <.001, and r = .658, p <.001, respectively). The results of this study bring about better understanding to nurses to nurses regarding the parental care behaviors on preventing respiratory tract infections in children with congenital heart disease. Thus, knowledge and self-efficacy of parents should be enhanced for improving care behaviors on preventing respiratory tract infections in children with congenital heart disease.

The prevalence of a chronic rheumatic heart disease among adult population of Ukraine (18 years and older) is 397.6 on 100 thousand population, and incidence \\u2014 6.4 on 100 thousand adult population. In Ukraine the specific weight of a chronic rheumatic heart disease as the reasons of primary disability among all population and employable population continues to remain the same (0.4 %) without tendency to decrease. At 30-50 % of patients with rheumatic heart diseases in the anamnesis do not reveal data on the postponed acute rheumatic fever. For the last decade the incidence of a chronic rheumatic heart disease decreased by 60 %, however, mortality increased by 78 %. Dynamics of negotiability to rheumatological departament of patients with acute and chronic forms of rheumatism and feature of a course of a chronic rheumatic heart disease in modern conditions was analysed. It was established that now the chronic rheumatic heart disease develops without the previous acute rheumatic fever, it is diagnosed at a stage of the formed heart disease or development of disturbances of a heartbeat and, is compensated throughout a long time. The clinical example of the patient having a chronic rheumatic heart disease is provided. Feature of this clinical case are: the long asymptomatic course of damage of heart, initially revealed mitral and aortal defect at the age of 51 year with prevalence of a mitral stenosis complicated by fibrillation of auricles; a mitral commissurotomy at the age of 56 years with fast development of a restenosis (in 58 years) when prosthetics of the mitral valve was offered; many years (up to 76 years) rather satisfactory condition with sharp deterioration within one month, due to the revealed critical mitral stenosis, heart failure \\u0406\\u0406\\u0406 St. Key words: acute rheumatic fever, chronic rheumatic heart disease, features of a current, clinical case.

It was originally a health problem endemic to South America, predominantly affecting residents of poor rural areas. With globalization and increasing migratory flows from these areas to large cities, the immigration of T. cruzi chronically-infected people to developed, non-endemic countries has occurred. This issue has emerged as an important consideration for heart transplant professionals. Currently, Chagas patients with end-stage heart failure may need a heart transplantation (HTx). This implies that in post-transplant immunosuppression therapy to avoid rejection in the recipient, there is the possibility of T. cruzi infection reactivation, increasing the morbidity and mortality rates. The management of heart transplant recipients due to Chagas disease requires awareness for early recognition and parasitic treatment of T. cruzi infection reactivation. This issue poses challenges for heart transplant professionals, especially regarding the differential diagnosis between rejection and reactivation episodes. The aim of this review is to discuss the complexity of the Chagas disease reactivation phenomenon in patients submitted to HTx for end-stage chagasic cardiomyopathy. chagasic cardiomyopathy; heart transplantation; Chagas disease reactivation; cardiac allograft rejection; treatment of reactivation; Medicine; R Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease, Vol 5, Iss 106, p 106 (2020) Maria da Consola\\u00e7\\u00e3o Vieira Moreira; Jos\\u00e9 Renan Cunha-Melo\"},{\"id\":\"9da242241d62e6aaa54eb3f80aff0e3ec6c17b32ae3c9d882f8a47a5f640eeab\",\"content\":\"Diagnosis of chronic heart failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Aim. To identify methods for diagnosing early signs of heart failure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Methods. We examined 54 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without exacerbation. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 - 26 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in combination with chronic heart failure; group 2 - 28 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without chronic heart failure. The groups were comparable by age and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Electrocardiography, echocardiography were performed with additional determination of the right heart chamber parameters, spirometry, X-ray, pulse oximetry. The level of highly sensitive C-reactive protein, blood acid-base composition and brain natriuretic peptide was evaluated. Results. Patients with comorbidity have decreased exercise tolerance according to the 6-minute walk test and mMRS scale, higher body mass index and dyspnea intensity, larger linear dimensions of the heart chambers and their volume parameters. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction was observed in 21 (80%) of patients in group 1, therefore, the signs of heart failure can be explained by diastolic dysfunction of the right and left ventricles. Among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure in our study, extended linear dimensions and structural changes in the ventricles, indicating pre- and postcapillary hypertension, were significantly more common. Conclusion. The use of tissue Doppler study allows more accurately determining the diastolic function of the right and left ventricles; the brain natriuretic peptide study is a sensitive marker of early forms of diastolic chronic heart failure. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic heart failure; diastolic dysfunction of the right and left ventricles; Medicine; R Kazanskij Medicinskij \\u017durnal, Vol 100, Iss 3, Pp 530-536 (2019) V I Koliev; I E Sarapulova; L V Ryabova\"},{\"id\":\"047ebc306b3c336c9896d842edf0d3c063646014f147ac21f9bfd93a495a3276\",\"content\":\"Proposing a new methodology on vague association rule mining for the diagnosis of heart disease hesitation patterns In the realistic situation, the health care has which contain imprecisely specified data. This imprecise data indicates the presence of vagueness, incompleteness and uncertainty which causes the problem during important decision-making task in the prediction of heart disease. Traditional Association Rule Mining has limitations as it only deals with the features that are actually present in the prediction of heart disease and ignores the features that are almost not considered for the heart disease prediction. Furthermore, these features may be placed with predictive feature by imposing its attractiveness measure; disease prediction pattern mining in the scenario of imprecise and vague environment is very difficult which is frequent in recent years. For the effectiveness of retrieved hesitated patterns and rules, the concept of vague set theory is used. For the same consideration, heart disease dataset features as weighting factor is used for generation of disease prediction patterns.

Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) represent a group with increased risk of stroke, silent brain infarcts, and vascular cognitive impairment. Cyanotic and other complex cardiac lesions confer the greatest risk of these cerebrovascular insults. ACHD patients, in addition to having an increased risk of stroke from structural cardiac issues and associated physiological changes, may have an accelerated burden of conventional vascular risk factors, including hypertension and impaired glucose metabolism. Adult neurologists should be aware of the risks of clinically evident and subclinical cerebrovascular disease in this population. We review the existing evidence on primary and secondary stroke prevention in individuals with complex congenital heart disease, and identify knowledge gaps in need of further research, including treatment of acute stroke in this population.

Such treatment may result in disease stabilization or regression. New terminology describes clinical presentations of Ischemic heart disease categorized as either acute coronary syndrome or chronic coronary syndrome. The reduction in prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease in a symptomatic population causes a lower pretest probability and clinical likelihood of disease, influencing the diagnostic work-up. Noninvasive functional or anatomic imaging for myocardial ischemia is recommended as the initial test to diagnose coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients, where obstructive disease cannot be excluded by clinical assessment alone. Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography has advanced and is first line in suitable patients, due to high rule-out power and further qualification of the diagnosis by functional assessment using noninvasive nuclear or magnetic resonance technology or CT-based fractional flow reserve (FFR-CT). Optimal medical treatment remains paramount, while FFR-guided myocardial revascularization in patients that are not responsive to antianginal treatment provides further symptom relieve as well as prognostic impact on prevention of spontaneous myocardial infarction.

Given the increased risk for severe COVID\\u201019 observed in adults with underlying cardiac involvement, there is concern that patients with pediatric and congenital heart disease (CHD) may likewise be at increased risk for severe infection. The cardiac manifestations of COVID\\u201019 include myocarditis, arrhythmia and myocardial infarction. Importantly, the pandemic has stretched health care systems and many care team members are at risk for contracting and possibly transmitting the disease which may further impact the care of patients with cardiovascular disease. In this review, we describe the effects of COVID\\u201019 in the pediatric and young adult population and review the cardiovascular involvement in COVID\\u201019 focusing on implications for patients with congenital heart disease in particular.

Methods: One-hundred-eighty children (aged 1-15 years) with underlying heart disease were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. The heart failures were categorized based on the Ross classification into 2 groups, non-heart failure (Ross classification I) and heart failure (Ross classification II-IV). The NT\\u2010proBNP level was determined and chest radiograph was done in posteroanterior upright position for CT ratio. Results: The mean NT-proBNP level was 223.1 pg\\/ml (+180.3) and a mean CT ratio was 53.6% (+5.6) in the non-heart failure group. The mean NT-proBNP level was 1,054 pg\\/ml (+1,840.3) and a mean CT ratio was 58.6% (+6.1) in heart failure group. There was a significantly positive correlation between heart failure symptoms and the level of NT-proBNP and CT ratio. In this study, the cut-off value of NT-proBNP for heart failure was more than 400 pg\\/ml (OR 6.97, ROC 0.694, sensitivity 52.6%, specificity 86.3%) and CT ratio more than 55% (OR 3.57, ROC 0.654, sensitivity 68%, specificity 62.8%). Conclusion: In pediatric heart diseases, there are strong positive correlations between heart failure with both NT-proBNP and CT ratio. These correlations help in the diagnosis of heart failure. NT-proBNP level more than 400 pg\\/ml and CT ratio more than 55% are indicative of heart failure in our population. Both investigations are inexpensive, readily available and do not require specialist experts.

RESULTS In this study, we used clinical and echocardiographic examination over a period of 1 year and evaluated 550 patients with confirmed valvular heart disease 350 of whom were diagnosed to have rheumatic heart diseases (RHD). 57.14% of these were females and the majority (26.28%) were in the age group of 16-20 years at the time of diagnosis. Our study also revealed that a vast majority of these patients (291) had mitral valve involvement (83.14%) of which 226 patients had isolated mitral stenosis (64.57%). The pulmonary valve was the least affected of all (1.71%). There were no patients with pure tricuspid stenosis. Tricuspid regurgitation (2.28%), pulmonary regurgitation (1.71%). Left sided lesions were far more common with pure MS (64.57%), pure MR (7.14%) and isolated AR and AS at 1.43% and 8.86%, respectively. The mixed valvular lesions were 14%. CONCLUSIONS Rheumatic heart disease was found to be more prevalent in females in the age group 16-20 years and involving the left side of heart more commonly. Involvement of the mitral valve was found in the majority of these patients.

However, heart can also cause diseases that affect the death. World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2012 showed that all deaths from cardiovascular disease (vascular) 7.4 million (42.3%) were caused by heart disease. Increased cases of heart disease require a step as an early prevention and prevention efforts by making early diagnosis of heart disease. In this research will be done early diagnosis of heart disease by using data mining process in the form of classification. The algorithm used is K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm with Forward Selection method. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used for classification in order to obtain a decision result from the diagnosis of heart disease, while the forward selection is used as a feature selection whose purpose is to increase the accuracy value. Forward selection works by removing some attributes that are irrelevant to the classification process. In this research the result of accuracy of heart disease diagnosis with K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is 73,44%, while result of K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm accuracy with feature selection method 78,66%. It is clear that the incorporation of the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm with the forward selection method has improved the accuracy result.

Furthermore, improvements in care of patients with complex congenital heart disease are now allowing most patients to reach adulthood. As some patients with adult congenital heart disease can remain asymptomatic until later in life, it is possible for them to serve in the military and eventually fall under the care of Veterans Administration (VA) providers. Therefore it is important for providers, especially cardiologists at VA centers, to have fundamental understanding of the management of adult congenital heart disease. This article provides multiple cases of adult congenital heart disease experienced at a single VA medical center and reviews the anatomy, physiology, and surgical management of each condition. anomalous venous return; atrial septal defect; congenital heart disease; cor triatriatum; sinus venosus defect; transposition of great arteries; Diseases of the circulatory (Cardiovascular) system; RC666-701 Cardiovascular Innovations and Applications, Vol 4, Iss 1, Pp 71-75 (2019) Robert F.

Most of these are expected to lead normal, productive lives if they are treated in time. However, 90% of babies born with congenital heart disease live in regions where medical care is inadequate or unavailable. The privilege of early diagnosis and timely intervention is restricted to only those born in developed countries. Added to the burden of congenital heart disease is rheumatic heart disease, which remains a global health problem in many low-income and middle-income countries. Providing optimal care for all these children is a daunting task, and requires funds and proper planning at various levels of the health care system.

Jennifer Kwong at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, USA, and co-workers reviewed research into the role of mitochondria and their associated signaling molecules in the development of heart disease. Mitochondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), signaling molecules involved in muscle contraction and calcium transfer in the heart, but they also destroy ROS to maintain a balance. Disruption to this balance can lead to elevated ROS, causing DNA and cellular damage, triggering disease. Animal trials using drugs to target mitochondrial ROS show promise in limiting heart disease progression. Further research is needed to determine whether this approach will work in humans and which specific heart problems might benefit from such therapies.

The authors indicate that an assessment of the features of coping behaviour in somatic patients, in particular those suffering from cardiovascular system diseases, is essential for improving the effectiveness of rehabilitation process. An analysis of the previous studies showed that patients with coronary heart disease are more likely to use such defence mechanisms as projection, intellectualisation, denial and coping strategies, such as repression and confrontation. The research objective was to identify the features of coping behaviour in patients with the painful form of coronary heart disease. The study involved 100 people: 50 patients with painful coronary heart disease and 50 with no history of cardiovascular disease, aged between 52 and 56 years. The main research methods included clinical interview; diagnostic methods: Life Style Index test; diagnostic method for coping strategies developed by E. Heim; Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS); Type of Person\\u2019s Attitude towards the Disease test; methods of mathematical processing and statistical evaluation. Patients with the painful form of coronary heart disease use psychological defence mechanisms more often than healthy individuals. They also use non-adaptive types of coping as compared to healthy people of the same age. The obtained data also correlate with the type of person\\u2019s attitude towards a disease: dominance of the sensitive type, the melancholic type of response, and the neurasthenic type. These features should be considered when developing a consistent approach to the rehabilitation programme with the psychocorrection of patients with coronary heart disease. coronary disease; illness behaviour; coping; Medicine; R Psychiatria i Psychologia Kliniczna, Vol 19, Iss 4, Pp 407-410 (2019) Zhanna Gardanova; Anastasia Grachyova; Vyacheslav Ilgov; Aleksandra Burma; Valeriia Manina; Albert Gardanov\"},{\"id\":\"716ba080beaabbf18a34dd32b8820b0e28acce4fbdf01ffcbc812e7695a89027\",\"content\":\"Susceptibility to ischaemic heart disease: Focusing on genetic variants for ATP-sensitive potassium channel beyond traditional risk factors Aims Ischaemic heart disease is classically associated with coronary artery disease.

Methods In this prospective nested case\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093control study based on the Swedish Twin Registry, 41,463 twin individuals who were aged \\u00e2\\u0089\\u00a540 and heart disease-free were followed up for 16\\u00c2 years (from 1998 to 2014) to detect incident heart disease. Type 2 diabetes was ascertained from self-report, the National Patient Registry and glucose-lowering medication use. Heart disease diagnosis (including coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and onset age were identified from the National Patient Registry. Healthy lifestyle-related factors consisted of being a non-smoker, no\\/mild alcohol consumption, regular physical activity and being non-overweight. Participants were divided into three groups according to the number of lifestyle-related factors: (1) unfavourable (participants who had no or only one healthy lifestyle factor); (2) intermediate (any two or three); and (3) favourable (four). Generalised estimating equation models for unmatched case\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093control design and conditional logistic regression for co-twin control design were used in data analyses. Results Of all participants, 2304 (5.5%) had type 2 diabetes at baseline. During the observation period, 9262 (22.3%) had any incident heart disease. In unmatched case\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093control analyses and co-twin control analyses, the multi-adjusted OR and 95% CI of heart disease related to type 2 diabetes was 4.36 (3.95, 4.81) and 4.89 (3.88, 6.16), respectively. The difference in ORs from unmatched case\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093control analyses vs co-twin control analyses was statistically significant (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.42, 1.73; p \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0089&lt;\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00890.001). In stratified analyses by type 2 diabetes, compared with an unfavourable lifestyle, an intermediate lifestyle or a favourable lifestyle was associated with a significant 32% (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49, 0.93) or 56% (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.30, 0.63) decrease in heart disease risk among patients with type 2 diabetes, respectively. There were significant additive and multiplicative interactions between lifestyle and type 2 diabetes on heart disease. Conclusions\\/interpretation Type 2 diabetes is associated with more than fourfold increased risk of heart disease. The association still remains statistically significant, even after fully controlling for genetic and early-life familial environmental factors. However, greater adherence to a healthy lifestyle may significantly mitigate the risk of heart disease related to type 2 diabetes.

The findings were not previously recognized in more than half of the patients (56%) prior to the study. Diagnosis had a potential impact on management in 31 (13%) patients including for 18 (7%) who would benefit from initiation of evidence-based heart failure therapy. After 2.8 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality among patients with and without left-sided heart disease was 52 and 32% respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95 (95%CI 1.25-3.06). A multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that left-sided heart disease was an independent predictor of mortality with a HR of 1.60 (95%CI 1.01-2.55) along with age (HR per year 1.05 [95%CI 1.03-1.07]). Conclusion: Left ventricular systolic dysfunction and moderate to severe valve disease are common and often unrecognized in patients with end-stage kidney failure on haemodialysis and are associated with a higher risk of death. For more than 10% of the included patients, systematic echocardiographic assessment had a potential clinical consequence.

Intertwined with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease embraces a spectrum of liver conditions spanning from steatosis to inflammation, fibrosis, and liver failure. Compared with the general population, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is higher among nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients, in whom comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment is highly desirable. Preclinical effects of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on the heart include both metabolic and structural changes eventually preceding overt myocardial dysfunction. Particularly, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with enhanced atherosclerosis, heart muscle disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias, with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and oxidative stress playing in the background. In this topical review, we aimed to summarize current evidence on the epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, discuss the pathophysiological links between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease, illustrate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\\u2013related cardiovascular phenotypes, and finally provide a glimpse on the relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiac steatosis, mitochondrial (dys)function, and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction.

In most endemic regions, affected patients present with heart failure. This statement will seek to examine the current state-of-the-art recommendations and to identify gaps in diagnosis and treatment globally that can inform strategies for reducing disease burden. Echocardiography screening based on World Heart Federation echocardiographic criteria holds promise to identify patients earlier, when prophylaxis is more likely to be effective; however, several important questions need to be answered before this can translate into public policy. Population-based registries effectively enable optimal care and secondary penicillin prophylaxis within available resources. Benzathine penicillin injections remain the cornerstone of secondary prevention. Challenges with penicillin procurement and concern with adverse reactions in patients with advanced disease remain important issues. Heart failure management, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of endocarditis, oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and prosthetic valves are vital therapeutic adjuncts. Management of health of women with unoperated and operated rheumatic heart disease before, during, and after pregnancy is a significant challenge that requires a multidisciplinary team effort. Patients with isolated mitral stenosis often benefit from percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty. Timely heart valve surgery can mitigate the progression to heart failure, disability, and death. Valve repair is preferable over replacement for rheumatic mitral regurgitation but is not available to the vast majority of patients in endemic regions. This body of work forms a foundation on which a companion document on advocacy for rheumatic heart disease has been developed. Ultimately, the combination of expanded treatment options, research, and advocacy built on existing knowledge and science provides the best opportunity to address the burden of rheumatic heart disease.

Globally, its prevalence is about 10\\/1000 live births. In Pakistan very few studies have been reported regarding the prevalence. Unfortunately, routine screening of heart of infants is not common in Pakistan. So it is very difficult to calculate exact pervasiveness of CHD in Pakistan. Objectives: Hence, this study was aimed at detecting congenital heart disease in infants in population of Abbottabad district. Methodology: This cross sectional study was conducted in DHQ Hospital Layyah during 2018 to 2019. 1683 infants who visited OPD for different complaints were assessed for congenital heart disease with the help of echocardiography. Results: out of 1683 infants, 303 (18%) were confirmed with congenital heart disease. Among the confirmed cases, 62.5 percent were males and 37.5 % were females. 78 % of the cases were between ages 1 to 3 months. The patients came with different presenting complaints like respiratory infection (48 %), underweight (31 %) and cyanosis (4%). Majority of cases were that of acyanotic congenital heart disease (98%). Ventricular septal defect (77.9%) was the most common congenital heart disease detected, followed by patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 11.5%, atrioventricular septal defect (ASD)7.9 %, tetratology of Fallot (TOF) 0.9 %, aortic stenosis2%. Conclusion: There is an utmost need to improve the efficacy of doctors of our pediatric OPDs to be able to detect heart murmur in our infant population. This can result in significant decrease in morbidity and mortality of congenital heart disease.

We aimed to describe the regional burden, trends, and inequalities of rheumatic heart disease in the Americas. Methods: In this secondary analysis of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, we extracted data for deaths, prevalence of cases, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years lived with disability, and years of life lost (YLL) as measures of rheumatic heart disease burden using the GBD Results Tool. We analysed 1990\\u20132017 trends in rheumatic heart disease mortality and prevalence, quantified cross-country inequalities in rheumatic heart disease mortality, and classified countries according to rheumatic heart disease mortality in 2017 and 1990\\u20132017. Findings: GBD 2017 estimated that 3 604 800 cases of rheumatic heart disease occurred overall in the Americas in 2017, with 22 437 deaths. We showed that in 2017 rheumatic heart disease mortality in the Americas was 51% (95% UI 44\\u201359) lower (1\\u00b78 deaths per 100 000 population [95% uncertainty interval 1\\u00b77\\u20131\\u00b79] vs 3\\u00b77 deaths per 100 000 population [3\\u00b74\\u20133\\u00b79]) and prevalence was 30% (29\\u201333) lower (346\\u00b74 cases per 100 000 [334\\u00b71\\u2013359\\u00b72] vs 500\\u00b76 cases per 100 000 [482\\u00b79\\u2013519\\u00b77]) than the corresponding global estimates. DALYs were half of those globally (55\\u00b77 per 100 000 [49\\u00b78\\u201363\\u00b75] vs 118\\u00b77 per 100 000 [108\\u00b75 to 130\\u00b77]), with a 70% contribution from YLL (39\\u00b71 out of 55\\u00b77 per 100 000). A significant reduction in rheumatic heart disease mortality occurred, from a regional average of 88\\u00b74 YLL per 100 000 (95% uncertainty interval 88\\u00b72\\u201388\\u00b76) in 1990 to 38\\u00b72 (38\\u00b71\\u201338\\u00b74) in 2017, and a significant reduction in income-related inequality, from an excess of 191\\u00b77 YLL per 100 000 (68\\u00b76\\u2013314\\u00b78) between the poorest and richest countries in 1990 to 66\\u00b78 YLL per 100 000 (6\\u00b74\\u2013127\\u00b72) in 2017. Of the 37 countries studied, eight (22%) had both the highest level of premature rheumatic heart disease mortality in 2017 and the smallest reduction in this mortality between 1990 and 2017. Interpretation: The Americas have greatly reduced premature mortality due to rheumatic heart disease since 1990. These health gains were paired with a substantial reduction in the magnitude of income-related inequalities across countries, which is consistent with overall socioeconomic and health improvements observed in the Region. Countries with less favourable rheumatic heart disease situations should be targeted for strengthening of their national programmes. Funding: None.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a reliable, easily reproducible, medium-throughput method to culture pig and human heart slices under physiological conditions for a prolonged period of time. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel, medium-throughput biomimetic culture system that maintains viability and functionality of human and pig heart slices (300 \\u00b5m thickness) for 6 days in culture. We optimized the medium and culture conditions with continuous electrical stimulation at 1.2 Hz and oxygenation of the medium. Functional viability of these slices over 6 days was confirmed by assessing their calcium homeostasis, twitch force generation, and response to \\u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Temporal transcriptome analysis using RNAseq at day 2, 6, and 10 in culture confirmed overall maintenance of normal gene expression for up to 6 days, while over 500 transcripts were differentially regulated after 10 days. Electron microscopy demonstrated intact mitochondria and Z-disc ultra-structures after 6 days in culture under our optimized conditions. This biomimetic culture system was successful in keeping human heart slices completely viable and functionally and structurally intact for 6 days in culture. We also used this system to demonstrate the effects of a novel gene therapy approach in human heart slices. Furthermore, this culture system enabled the assessment of contraction and relaxation kinetics on isolated single myofibrils from heart slices after culture. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and optimized a reliable medium-throughput culture system for pig and human heart slices as a platform for testing the efficacy of novel heart failure therapeutics and reliable testing of cardiotoxicity in a 3D heart model.

The study included 53 patients with a combination of stable ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 53 patients with stable ischemic heart disease without concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 42 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease without ischemic heart disease. Cardiac rhythm disturbances during spirography were examined by synchronous determination of the external respiration function and 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring, predictors of high grade ventricular extrasystoles appearance in patients with combined pathology were calculated.

This statement will review in\\u2010hospital readiness for discharge, caregiver support and education, healthcare teams and resources, surveillance strategies and practices, national quality improvement efforts, interstage outcomes, and future areas for research. The statement is directed toward pediatric cardiologists, primary care providers, subspecialists, advanced practice providers, nurses, and those caring for infants undergoing staged surgical palliation for single ventricle heart disease.

Patients must have to enroll in a disease management program to engage in self-care. However, symptom recognition is a difficult step to manage by patients, as they tend to wait for the symptoms to disappear. The aim of this study is to verify if patients with heart failure can recognize early signs of the disease. Method: A systematic review will be carried out to analyze the effectiveness of patient education in detecting heart failure symptoms. Results: The systematic review will provide data to understand if patient education on heart failure symptom recognition is effective on reducing hospital admissions. Conclusions: Patients with heart failure struggle daily in balancing self-care. If not taught about what symptoms to expect, patients will sit and wait at home, resulting in severe hospital admissions. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analysis focused on associations among symptoms in individuals with heart failure, or on a multicomponent Heart failure management programs, with several teaching topics. This protocol for a new review, which will focus on symptom monitoring by patients with heart failure, and the development of this skill positively interferes with self-care and avoids hospital readmissions.

We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the association of resting heart rate and its change with incident CVD in the middle-aged and older Chinese. Resting heart rate was measured during the baseline survey (September 2008 to June 2010) and the resurvey (2013). Incident CVD was followed up until December 31, 2016. Finally, a total of 20,828 participants were included in the analyses of baseline heart rate and 9132 participants were included in the analyses of heart rate change. The associations of baseline heart rate and heart rate change with incident CVD were assessed with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Compared with moderate baseline heart rate (65 to 80 bpm), low baseline heart rate (<65 bpm) was associated with higher risk of CVD (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07\\u20131.32). Compared with stable heart rate (\\u22125 to 15 bpm) in the moderate baseline heart rate group (65 to 80 bpm), an increase of heart rate (>15 bpm) in high baseline heart rate group (>80 bpm) (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.02\\u20132.71) or a decrease of heart rate (<\\u22125 bpm) in low baseline heart rate group (<65 bpm) (HR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.27\\u20134.82) was associated with higher risk of CVD. In conclusion, low resting heart rate is associated with higher risk of CVD. Both continuous increase in high baseline heart rate and decrease in low baseline heart rate are associated with higher risk of CVD.

Accordingly, many researchers have sought curative options, often using laboratory animal models such as rodents. However, the physiology of the human heart differs significantly from that of the rodent heart. In this study, we developed a model of ischemic heart disease using cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS-CMs). After optimizing the conditions of ischemia, including the concentration of oxygen and duration of application, we evaluated the consequent damage to hiPS-CMs. Notably, exposure to 2% oxygen, 0 mg\\/ml glucose, and 0% fetal bovine serum increased the percentage of nuclei stained with propidium iodide, an indicator of membrane damage, and decreased cellular viability. These conditions also decreased the contractility of hiPS-CMs. Furthermore, ischemic conditioning increased the mRNA expression of IL-8, consistent with observed conditions in the in vivo heart. Taken together, these findings suggest that our hiPS-CM-based model can provide a useful platform for human ischemic heart disease research.

As we know, one of the most commonly associated congenital hypothyroidism disorders is congenital heart disease, which has a significant effect on the recovery of patients suffering from these disorders. On the other hand, both of these cases are visible and consistent in patients with Down syndrome. Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality among live-born infants, which usually has certain characteristic signs, including a variety of dysmorphic features, such as flat facial features, small head and ears, short neck, and congenital malformations, the most important of which are congenital heart diseases and other health problems and medical conditions. In what follows, we will study the diagnosis and treatment of an infant with Down syndrome undergoing surgery due to congenital heart disease, whose late detection of hypothyroidism led to lack of proper response to heart failure correction. congenital heart disease; heart failure; Hypothyroidism; treatment-resistant; Pediatrics; RJ1-570 Iranian Journal of Neonatology, Vol 10, Iss 3, Pp 97-98 (2019) Forod Salehi; Atefe Ziaee; Arvin Mirshahi\"}]"
