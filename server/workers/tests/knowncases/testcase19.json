Our worsening situation is not due to lack of knowledge, science and technology; in broad terms, we knew most of the challenges and many of the needed solutions back in the 1970s. Instead, the challenges we face are social, rooted in cultural values, political ideologies, legal and economic systems, ethical principles and spiritual\\/religious beliefs.

Superflab, Super Stuff pink wax and Paraffin wax bolus materials are used with 15MeV electron energy for dosimetric comparison. Additionally, 10 mm thick Super Stuff pink wax bolus and paraffin wax bolus materials were placed on the right eyelid of a patient. Using electron dose calculation algorithm and ion chamber measurements, dosimetric comparisons were made in the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Both for measured and calculated dose, values were acquired 3 times and averaged for each case. Resulting differences are expressed as percentage differences. Dose differences were obtained in measurements with and without using bolus at several locations of the solid phantom, performed by the Roos Ion chamber. Dosimetric differences of 7-7.5% for Superflab, 10-10.5% for paraffin bolus and 13-14% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus are obtained. Besides, when dosimetric comparisons are made in the treatment planning system for cases with and without bolus; Dose differences were calculated to be 2-2.5% for superflab silicon bolus, 3-3.5% for paraffin wax bolus and 5-6% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus. To increase skin dose in curved anatomical structures in radiotherapy, it is safe to use the paraffin wax bolus material in radiotherapy clinic, as an alternative to Superflab silicon bolus and Super Stuff pink wax bolus materials, due to its low cost and ease of conforming to body surface contours.\",\"published_in\":\"Volume: 16, Issue: 2 201-205 ; 1305-130X ; 1305-1385 ; Celal Bayar University Journal of Science\",\"year\":\"2020-06-24T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Radiotherapy,Superflab,Paraffin,Super Stuff\",\"subject\":\"Radiotherapy,Superflab,Paraffin,Super Stuff\",\"authors\":\"ARAS, Serhat; TANZER, \\u0130hsan Oguz; \\u0130K\\u0130ZCEL\\u0130, T\\u00fcrkan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/cbayarfbe\\/issue\\/55133\\/654782\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"aef90adac1fcf5749967853e586d7084350db74d0886d1d878de7727635d27ba\",\"relevance\":112,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"8928fc430e33d7ae045156514e15fa05c8cd17c5facb7a4dbdc10a5ecc34c1bf\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.rniito.org\\/jour\\/article\\/view\\/1471; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2311-2905; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2542-0933; 2311-2905; 2542-0933; doi:10.21823\\/2311-2905-2020-26-2-9-14; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/d5e60780c29a4b369f971d8b4812e4f9\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21823\\/2311-2905-2020-26-2-9-14; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/d5e60780c29a4b369f971d8b4812e4f9\",\"title\":\"Trauma Care in COVID-19 Pandemic\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The development of COVID-19 pandemic is the serious challenge for trauma care systems across the world.

Delay of all elective cases, restriction of surgical treatment of fractures with relative indications for surgery are recommended. The segregation of cases into COVID-19 confirmed or suspected and COVID-19 negative patients is important. When possible before the admission to in-patient department the patient shall be tested on COVID-19. When the COVID-19 status of the patient is unclear all possible protection measures shall be used: patient isolation and medical stuff protection. To prevent the spread of infection it is recommended to split the stuff of the traumacenter into 2 or 3 groups. Each of the groups is working during the week with subsequent period of the self-isolation (remote work) for the period of 1-2 weeks (according to the duration of incubation period of the COVID-19).

The paper concludes by elaborating how types of use in reference to types of stuff provide insight on participant skills, learning and engagement that can result in change of roles over time. ; Peer reviewed\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"6132 Visual arts and design; Infrastructuring; makerspaces; peer production; design; participatory design; user; use\",\"subject\":\" Infrastructuring; makerspaces; peer production; design; participatory design; user; use\",\"authors\":\"Hirscher, Anja-Lisa; Maze, Ramia\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/aaltodoc.aalto.fi\\/handle\\/123456789\\/39743\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"f64b456b8b6daa463441d399b7f4ccb97ac7db885ddf77a36ef73c4434edd7e2\",\"relevance\":110,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"79cecc136db402fb219f9c817649c21469ee7a3d47ba5bb6202aa761ed9892af\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/oficinadohistoriador\\/article\\/view\\/36502\\/19709; http:\\/\\/revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/oficinadohistoriador\\/article\\/view\\/36502; doi:10.15448\\/2178-3748.2020.1.36502\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/oficinadohistoriador\\/article\\/view\\/36502; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.15448\\/2178-3748.2020.1.36502\",\"title\":\"Material culture studies: on things and stuff in Archaeology ; Estudos de cultura material: sobre coisas e subst\\u00e2ncias na Arqueologia\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This essay hopes to address the communicative and expressive qualities of material culture and of stuff, regardless of any chronological limit and through an interdisciplinary dialogue with archaeologists, anthropologists, historians, sociologists, economists, psychologists and philosophers. My expectancy to this text is to incorporate into the study of material culture the interference of things as well as stuff into the record and archaeological practices. Recent studies of material culture emphasizes the meaning of things as well as stuff and start from the idea that they can be perceived and seen as signs that help their owners and users in their communicative processes, and in the formation of identities. I believe that perceiving these processes as a dynamic network of interrelations will help establish accurate and participatory phenomenological connections with other members of society, and better understand the symmetrical relationships between people, things, and stuff. ; Este ensaio espera tratar das qualidades da cultura material e das subst\\u00e2ncias, as comunicativas e as expressivas, independentemente de qualquer limite cronol\\u00f3gico e atrav\\u00e9s de um di\\u00e1logo interdisciplinar com arque\\u00f3logos, antrop\\u00f3logos, historiadores, soci\\u00f3logos, economistas, psic\\u00f3logos e fil\\u00f3sofos.

British playwright, David Hare, belongs to a trend of war drama that enables the world to witness the truth, trauma and the violence of US-Iraq war. Stuff Happens subtly helps show how US coercive diplomacy manipulates other Powers to fulfill the new doctrine of \\\" New American Century.\\\" In Stuff Happens, Hare documents the recent tragic history of Iraq in such an approach that blends the documentary with the fictional to display the events from 2000, till the actual invasion of Iraq in April, 2003.

In everyday spoken British English, the phrase and (all) that is also extremely common.

KiP is an epistemological perspective that views knowledge as a complex system of many types of knowledge elements. These include the so-called explanatory primitives (e-prims), that is, intuitive knowledge elements that people use when interpreting the world. The aim of this study was to gauge the potential of KiP in the field of research on pre-instructional conceptual knowledge in the geosciences by analysing conceptions of the complex hydrological issue of the formation of water springs. When probing student explanations of springs for e-prims in two case studies involving 12-year-old boys, we identified two explanatory primitives not previously documented.

This paper presents a new conceptualisation of material possessions that could be of use to those involved in housing design. Three universal characteristics of material possessions; value, temporality and visibility are used to identify the space in the home that possessions might require. A conceptual framework that integrates these characteristics with spatial information about the interior of the home is developed. The paper argues that the conceptual framework could help designers, policymakers and house builders to better understand first the nature of material possessions, and second how those possessions could be accommodated in contemporary homes, ultimately supporting improved quality of life and wellbeing for households.\",\"published_in\":\"Interiority, Vol 3, Iss 2, Pp 219-242 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"architectural design; design practice; interior design; housing; storage; Architecture; NA1-9428\",\"subject\":\"architectural design; design practice; interior design; housing; storage; Architecture; \",\"authors\":\"Elena Marco; Katie Williams; Sonja Oliveira\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7454\\/in.v3i2.78\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"167b479382d84aba9790fbc8763f9951c77f25ce9c6bd1d4085affa910e0ad80\",\"relevance\":103,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.7454\\/in.v3i2.78\"},{\"id\":\"5ff4483d8292375dfdc114660990f945719b3a110586330e9158b698d9f069b6\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.envsci.2020.06.003; Alexander, KA and Amundsen, VS and Osmundsen, TC, Social stuff' and all that jazz: understanding the residual category of social sustainability, Environmental Science and Policy, 112 pp. 61-68.

Therefore, we have to move beyond science and technology and address these broader socio-cultural issues by engaging in economic, legal and political work, complementing and supplementing \\u2018head stuff\\u2019 with \\u2018heart, gut and spirit stuff\\u2019, and working from the grass roots up.\",\"published_in\":\"Challenges, Vol 10, Iss 1, p 31 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"planetary health; Anthropocene; climate change; biodiversity loss; ecological crisis; cultural values; political ideologies; legal and economic systems; ethical principles and spiritual\\/religious beliefs; Technology; T; Science (General); Q1-390\",\"subject\":\"planetary health; Anthropocene; climate change; biodiversity loss; ecological crisis; cultural values; political ideologies; legal and economic systems; ethical principles and spiritual\\/religious beliefs; Technology; T; \",\"authors\":\"Trevor Hancock\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/challe10010031\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5b21dcb5a40403ccdafe70809c0361a7f4f1395e4c9676312b841f2ed5978726\",\"relevance\":100,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/challe10010031\"},{\"id\":\"2872dfb4d53add42434efc59f339e67cb039bef5667c64558d8dcac1e1a03280\",\"relation\":\"Vol. 54, No. 2, pp. 701-722; doi:10.1111\\/joca.12298; CFP\\u201012\\u2010Z\\u201000006; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10871\\/121627; 0022-0078; 1745-6606; Journal of Consumer Affairs\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10871\\/121627; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1111\\/joca.12298\",\"title\":\"Do not swipe the small stuff: A randomized evaluation of rules of thumb-based financial education\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This is the author accepted manuscript. ; We perform the first rigorous test of a rules of thumb-based approach to financial education on consumer behavior and outcomes.

In this paper, we present possible new applications of SPANs and results of feasibility studies. Preliminary tests indicate that users interact with smart stuff\\u2014in our case, a smart water bottle\\u2014dozens of times a day and sufficiently long to collect vital signs of the users. Synergistic processing of sensors from the smartwatch and objects of everyday use may provide user identification and assessment of new parameters that individual sensors could not generate, such as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and blood pressure. As a result, SPANs facilitate seamless monitoring and annotation of vital signs dozens of times per day, every day, every time the smart object is used, without additional setup of sensors and initiation of measurements. SPANs creates a dynamic \\u201copportunistic bubble\\u201d for ad-hoc integration with other sensors of interest around the user, wherever they go. Continuous long-term monitoring of user\\u2019s activity and vital signs can provide better diagnostic procedures and personalized feedback to motivate a proactive approach to health and wellbeing.\",\"published_in\":\"Sensors, Vol 19, Iss 19, p 4295 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"wearable monitoring; health monitoring; mhealth; wireless body area networks; iot; smart stuff; ambient-assisted living; aging in place; Chemical technology; TP1-1185\",\"subject\":\"wearable monitoring; health monitoring; mhealth; wireless body area networks; iot; smart stuff; ambient-assisted living; aging in place; Chemical technology; \",\"authors\":\"Emil Jovanov\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/s19194295\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c3a982ad1ca353c721bd1687b52c1c1076178d21947514a02cf2a0118010043b\",\"relevance\":89,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/s19194295\"},{\"id\":\"493f9417a0f52a8eb32ecfce97750c6dbe68b6ead617e1feed95b78871b5bc23\",\"relation\":\"10.1109\\/CVPR.2017.544; Proceedings, 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017); 978-1-5386-0457-1; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1721.1\\/124982; Zhou, Bolei, et al., \\\"Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset.\\\" Proceedings, 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (Piscataway, N.J.: IEEE, 2017): p. 5122-30 doi 10.1109\\/CVPR.2017.544 \\u00a92017 Author(s)\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1721.1\\/124982\",\"title\":\"Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Scene parsing, or recognizing and segmenting objects and stuff in an image, is one of the key problems in computer vision. Despite the community's efforts in data collection, there are still few image datasets covering a wide range of scenes and object categories with dense and detailed annotations for scene parsing. In this paper, we introduce and analyze the ADE20K dataset, spanning diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases even parts of parts. A scene parsing benchmark is built upon the ADE20K with 150 object and stuff classes included. Several segmentation baseline models are evaluated on the benchmark. A novel network design called Cascade Segmentation Module is proposed to parse a scene into stuff, objects, and object parts in a cascade and improve over the baselines. We further show that the trained scene parsing networks can lead to applications such as image content removal and scene synthesis. \\u00a92017 Paper presented at the 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017), July 21-26, 2017, Honolulu, Hawaii. ; NSF (grant no. 1524817)\",\"published_in\":\"MIT web domain\",\"year\":\"2019-07-11T16:46:10Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Zhou, Bolei; Zhao, Hang; Puig Fernandez, Francesco Xavier; Fidler, Sanja; Barriuso, Adela; Torralba, Antonio\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1721.1\\/124982\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"493f9417a0f52a8eb32ecfce97750c6dbe68b6ead617e1feed95b78871b5bc23\",\"relevance\":88,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\",\"Conference object\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"fd21e04a6336dcc6f488fe3d7820acd2616a4ec6c1b9e81e154b1ad361430317\",\"relation\":\"Mthembu, J. et al. 2020.

Therefore, interventions that promote sexual health and reduce risk are critical to develop for these couples. Given the disproportionate burden of HIV among populations of color, it is also critical that these interventions are culturally congruent. The EBAN intervention for African American serodiscordant couples recognizes the centrality of culture in shap\\u00ading sexual behaviors and helps couples develop intimacy and positive prevention behaviors. The analytic objective of our study was to examine the knowledge and awareness gained by participants in the intervention. Participants: Participants (n=17) who com\\u00adpleted at least half of the eight intervention sessions. Methods: Brief post-implementation semi-structured interviews were conducted be\\u00adtween January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Team-based, targeted content analysis focused on knowledge and awareness gains. Results: Participants described learning about sexual health, expanded sexual options, and sexual communication. The \\u201cEBAN caf\\u00e9,\\u201d a component that gives couples a menu of options for safer sex behaviors, was particularly popular.

Conclusions: Couples at risk for HIV trans\\u00admission benefit from strengthening skills and knowledge related to healthy sexual\\u00adity.

Using posts (n = 975) on Facebook pages and tweets (n = 889) on Twitter handles of Stuff.co.nz and NZHerald.co.nz from 12 November to 17 November, we analysed how media users reacted to breaking news coverage of a major natural disaster. The results show that quake news gets significantly more interaction and reactions than non-quake news on both social media platforms. For Twitter, quake news gets significantly more interactions such as likes, and retweets, but not replies. However, for Facebook, quake news gets significantly more comments, likes, wows, and sad emotional feedbacks, but no significant difference in emotions such as love, haha, and angry. The emotions people have on Facebook indicate well the nature of the news. With Facebook\\u2019s new function of reactions including, like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry, makes reactions more expressive and relevant. The study also shows a clear pattern of reactions on the two social media platforms across the timeline. While the number of posts keeps stable over the period, users\\u2019 reactions soared in the first two days of the quake; The responses subsided after the chaotic period of the disaster was over. The study provides an insight into how mainstream news websites are using social media in reporting and engaging with users during major natural disasters.

The goal of this study is to explore children\\u2019s practices, perceptions, and knowledge regarding passwords. Given the limited work to date and that the world\\u2019s cyber posture and culture will be dependent on today\\u2019s youth, it is imperative to conduct cyber-security research with children. We conducted surveys of 189 3rd to 8th graders from two Midwest schools in the USA. We found that children have on average two passwords for school and three to four passwords for home. They kept their passwords private and did not share with others. They created passwords with an average length of 7 (3rd to 5th graders) and 10 (6\\u20138th graders). But, only about 13% of the children created very strong passwords. Generating strong passwords requires mature cognitive and linguistic capabilities which children at this developmental stage have not yet mastered. They believed that passwords provide access control, protect their privacy and keep their \\u201cstuff\\u201d safe. Overall, children had appropriate mental models of passwords and demonstrated good password practices. Cyber-security education should strive to reinforce these positive practices while continuing to provide and promote age-appropriate developmental security skills.

The case of Israel illustrates implementation of a system for assessing and assuring quality standards in higher education that is recognized as one of the highest national priorities. Quality assurance at Israeli higher education institutions is regulated by The Quality Assessment and Assurance Division. Nevertheless, Israeli Council for Higher Education promotes culture of establishing internal mechanisms to assure academic quality. The case study of quality assurance strategies in Israeli higher education institutions was focused on the analysis of key activities managed by teaching and learning centers. These centers are dedicated to professional development of faculty members to promote learning outcome of study programs through innovative teaching methodologies. Missions and functions of the centers are based on common international standards. The spectrum of activities includes: professional development of teaching stuff (workshops for newly recruited both senior and junior stuff, and individual teaching consultations to senior stuff); technological and pedagogical support for curricula and course design (from lecture-based to fully online-courses support); implementation and integration of new technologies: particularly by scouting, absorbing and effectively implementing digital technologies; and conducting students\\u2019 teaching satisfaction surveys.

Drawing on the reading of scientific literature and a series of interviews with scientists working at the juncture of soil and climate research, this article pursues a picture that highlights soil\\u2019s capacities to shape future climates, including by fostering major planetary tipping points; we elaborate on the cultural and ethical significance of that picture for opening up alternative stories in which agency and change are not human-only pre\\u00acrogatives. We develop a critical stance on the growing expectations of storing more carbon into soils and argue for a better consideration of the situated, heterogeneous, and volatile dynamics of carbon within soils. We eventually call for more responsible ways of thinking about, and caring for, the myriad conglomerates of living, decaying, and dead matter that basically make up the stuff of soil.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"160808 - Sociology and Social Studies of Science and Technology; 160802 - Environmental Sociology; 970116 - Expanding Knowledge through Studies of Human Society; soils; soil science; carbon sequestration; climatic changes\",\"subject\":\"- Sociology and Social Studies of Science and Technology;- Environmental Sociology;- Expanding Knowledge through Studies of Human Society; soils; soil science; carbon sequestration; climatic changes\",\"authors\":\"Granjou, Celine; Salazar, Juan Francisco (R11072)\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3167\\/nc.2019.140103\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"68f637b6d442f40d5dc30a1440502a0a4963443d7da7faab7f364923f6a5abec\",\"relevance\":76,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3167\\/nc.2019.140103\"},{\"id\":\"50c64190c193cf0aeb9399c1eff3ce04da61fa3e85ff3a1f27ca2d4524621f9c\",\"relation\":\"Thomas, M orcid.org\\/0000-0002-9590-0583 (2020) Multimodality and media archaeology: complementary optics for looking at digital stuff?

I begin by considering the development of multimodality in relation to the emphasis that media archaeologists place on non-linear and parallel histories, the relativity of \\u2018newness\\u2019, and cyclical thinking. I then move on to consider some of the respective conceptual undergirding of multimodality and media archaeology, focussing on key issues of materiality and media specificity, signs and signals, media convergence and commensurability. I argue that this juxtaposition brings fresh perspectives to the question of \\u2018mode\\u2019. Significantly, these are attuned both to social and formal considerations, but in ways that differ from both social semiotic orientations and other approaches to multimodality. Having considered these fundamentals, I turn to questions of interactivity, product, and process, and the blurring of boundaries between categories such as reading and writing. As a final intersection, I bring the growing interest in integrating quantitative, corpus-based methods in multimodal analysis into dialogue with the prioritization of the digital archive as a site of specific media archaeological interest with inherent potential for algorithmic manipulation. I conclude with some observations about the status of multimodality and media archaeology as communities and, more specifically, the potential for complementarity between them.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-06-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Thomas, M\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.whiterose.ac.uk\\/157913\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"50c64190c193cf0aeb9399c1eff3ce04da61fa3e85ff3a1f27ca2d4524621f9c\",\"relevance\":75,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"67a2e889f60e3d812f024400f31c4245d006b6122b01cffba237f5c0aae94c99\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/rajpub.com\\/index.php\\/jap\\/article\\/view\\/8811\\/8058; https:\\/\\/rajpub.com\\/index.php\\/jap\\/article\\/view\\/8811; doi:10.24297\\/jap.v18i.8811\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/rajpub.com\\/index.php\\/jap\\/article\\/view\\/8811; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24297\\/jap.v18i.8811\",\"title\":\"Magnetism: Entanglement, Konke and the Magnet as Discrete\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Understanding that everything is in a relationship led us to ask what then is the relationship that caused particles to be.

There are three contexts of the problem: of comparison, of change and of interaction. Philosophical explanations of facts indicated in the three contexts need reference to properties and to a proper understanding of a relationship between them and their bearers. My aim is to get closer to this understanding with the use of some models but previously I present the substantialist theory of object and shortly argue for its main theses. The two models enabling us the understanding of the subject\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093properties structure are: the plastic stuff model and the functional model. On the ground of the first a subject is compared to a piece of plastic stuff which is informed by different shapes.

As such they are similar to mathematical functions which are saturated by values.

Selection practices in The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, an elite military unit in the Arctic 1950\\u20132015This article investigates the development of the selection practice for the Danish Army\\u2019s Sirius unit. The dog sled patrol protects the sovereignty of the realm and maintains surveillance in Northeast Greenland by patrolling the uninhabited national park. The investigation is primarily based on interviews with former, retired and current managers of the unit, as well as psychologists involved in the selection practice. Four empirically and contextually substantiated chronological intersections of the selection-period of practice are compared: The first intersection covers the establishment of the patrol in the beginning of the 1950s. The second intersection covers the span of years from the 1960s to 1990, during which a basic selection practice was developed and institutionalized. The third intersection covers a ten-year span from 1990 to the millennium. Several noteworthy changes in the selection took place in this period. The forth intersection describes the current selection practice and puts the selection process in perspective. The investigation documents a significant evolution in selection practices over time.

Selection practices in The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, an elite military unit in the Arctic 1950\\u20132015This article investigates the development of the selection practice for the Danish Army\\u2019s Sirius unit. The dog sled patrol protects the sovereignty of the realm and maintains surveillance in Northeast Greenland by patrolling the uninhabited national park. The investigation is primarily based on interviews with former, retired and current managers of the unit, as well as psychologists involved in the selection practice. Four empirically and contextually substantiated chronological intersections of the selection-period of practice are compared: The first intersection covers the establishment of the patrol in the beginning of the 1950s. The second intersection covers the span of years from the 1960s to 1990, during which a basic selection practice was developed and institutionalized. The third intersection covers a ten-year span from 1990 to the millennium. Several noteworthy changes in the selection took place in this period. The forth intersection describes the current selection practice and puts the selection process in perspective. The investigation documents a significant evolution in selection practices over time.

Finding alternative insecticides to those because of their inefficiency pollute the environment and poison consumers is an emergency. An ethno-botanical survey conducted with about 300 farmers in the Far North region of Cameroon identified 15 local plants insecticides associated with food during storage in combination with two or three others. Among these plants, the most used are Hyptis spicigera (Lamiaceae) 78%, Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) 76.6% and Vepris heterophylla (Rutaceae) 28,33% which is more used in mountain area. The powders of these single plants are insecticides on T. castaneum, however A. indica single or in combination with H. spicigera gives better insecticidal efficacy 73.33% and 66.67% mortality respectively.Keywords: Tribolium castaneum, stocked food stuff, combination, vegetal powder, insecticide\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Biological and Chemical Sciences; Vol 13, No 3 (2019); 1613-1620 ; 1997-342X ; 1991-8631\",\"year\":\"2019-09-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"Tribolium castaneum; stocked food stuff; combination; vegetal powder; insecticide\",\"subject\":\"Tribolium castaneum; stocked food stuff; combination; vegetal powder; insecticide\",\"authors\":\"Ayiki, Ev\\u00e9l\\u00e9 Nathanael; Tamgno, B\\u00e9ranger Raoul; Madou, Chantal; Vatsou, J\\u00e9r\\u00e9mie; Ngassoum, Martin Benoit; Ngamo Tinkeu, L\\u00e9onard Simon\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ajol.info\\/index.php\\/ijbcs\\/article\\/view\\/189643\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"840109fdfe598e4a04bf6256b6346c30a24ccdd6fce7998be5bcf903030fd841\",\"relevance\":62,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9fb1c6872b573975c1525fc0305bd7df27aaddd00a79fcf8e4ed77ad3b952f83\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ejournal.unitomo.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jsk\\/article\\/view\\/1681; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2549-7294; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2549-7626; 2549-7294; 2549-7626; doi:10.25139\\/jsk.v3i3.1681; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/48b621413d0f4583bd0fdf36502e9043\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25139\\/jsk.v3i3.1681; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/48b621413d0f4583bd0fdf36502e9043\",\"title\":\"Paparan selektif penggunaan fitur senyap dan teman dekat pada twitter dan instagram\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Social media has become a part of human\\u2019s life.

Not only that but users can also choose their friends, what kind of content they want to see, what kind of relationship then want to have, or to keep certain content just for a few people to see through social media. A few features like mute feature to close friends feature are there for users to use on Twitter and Instagram. This research will try to find out how those features are being used by the users and why those features are needed. In depth interview is used to six informants who use the mute and close friend feature on Twitter or Instagram. Selective exposure theory is used to see how someone is more interested in seeing contents that match their believes and interests. It shows that mute feature is used to filter some stuff that they want to see and avoid things they don\\u2019t like. The mute feature also useful for keeping the relationship in a good term between the users and other people.

Electronic databases, journals and reference lists were examined for inclusion. Data were extracted by two reviewers and validated by another reviewer, using a standardised extraction sheet along with a quality assessment. Two meta-analyses of aSCR measures were conducted to test the relationship between overall aSCR and IGT performance, and differences in aSCR between advantageous and disadvantageous decks. Twenty studies were included in this review. Quality assessment revealed that five studies did not measure anticipatory responses, and few stated they followed standard IGT and\\/or psychophysiological procedures. The first meta-analysis of 15 studies revealed a significant, small-to-medium relationship between aSCR and IGT performance (r= .22). The second meta-analysis of eight studies revealed a significant, small difference in aSCR between the advantageous and disadvantageous decks (r= .10); however, publication bias is likely to be an issue. Meta-analyses revealed aSCR evidence supporting the SMH. However, inconsistencies in the IGT and psychophysiological methods, along with publication bias, cast doubt on these effects. It is recommended that future tests of the SMH use a range of psychophysiological measures, a standardised IGT protocol, and discriminate between advantageous and disadvantageous decks. ; N\\/A\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-09-06\",\"subject_orig\":\"Decision-making; Emotion; Reward\",\"subject\":\"Decision-making; Emotion; Reward\",\"authors\":\"Simonovic, Boban; Stupple, Edward J.

Using classic Delphi technique and pairwise comparison, the components were given to 32 specialists in emergency medicine, nuclear medicine, medical physics, nuclear physics, radiobiology and radiation protection, health in disaster and emergency, and passive defense. Finally, the national model was developed by holding two focus group sessions.Results: The results from the two rounds of Delphi technique showed that 31 factors of preparedness were classified into three main classes, namely staff, stuff, and structure (system). Only three factors were excluded and the rest were agreed upon by the specialists. Given the weight of each class, it was found that staff preparedness and stuff preparedness had the highest and lowest priorities, respectively.Conclusion: Comprehensive preparedness requires enhancing and promoting cultural, social, economic, and political levels. Indeed, all preparedness levels should be promoted in alignment with each other. Hence, governments should align their policies to manage such incidents.\",\"published_in\":\"Bulletin of Emergency and Trauma, Vol 7, Iss Issue 3, Pp 300-306 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Preparedness; Emergency department; hospital; Radiation incidents; Nuclear incidents; Terrorism; Medical emergencies.

However, a national disaster plan has not yet been established. Aim: From September 2017, representatives of seven regional emergency medical centers in Seoul met monthly and decided to investigate basic data for the future establishment of surge capacity planning. Methods: Staff, supply, space, and systems for surge capacity were surveyed in seven hospitals. The additional surveyed data were as follows: hospital incident command system and actual operational experience; performance of disaster drill; safety and security plan; estimation of surge capacity in normal operating conditions and extreme operating conditions; alternative therapeutic spaces; back-up plan to call non-duty medical staff; decontamination equipment; contingency plan for stuff shortage; etc. Results: All the hospitals reported they have hospital incident command systems and held disaster drills every year, however, the two hospitals (28.5%) had no real experience of hospital incident command system activation. Five hospitals (71.4%) did not have a safety and security plan. They replied they can treat average 7.7 emergency patients (Korean Triage and Acute scale (KTAS) \\u2264 3), 10 non-emergent patients (KTAS&gt;4), 0.9 surgical patients and 0.7 unstable patients simultaneously in normal operating conditions. In extreme operating conditions, they replied they can treat average 26.4 emergency patients (KTAS \\u2264 3), 54.3 non-emergent patients (KTAS&gt;4), 37 surgical patients and 2.3 unstable patients simultaneously. The two hospitals (28.5%) had no alternative therapeutic spaces, no back-up plan to call non-duty medical staff and no contingency plan for stuff shortage. Three hospitals (42.9%) did not have decontamination equipment. Discussion: The survey revealed the basic data for surge capacity planning in Seoul.

The goal of this study is to explore children\\u2019s practices, perceptions, and knowledge regarding passwords. Given the limited work to date and that the world\\u2019s cyber posture and culture will be dependent on today\\u2019s youth, it is imperative to conduct cyber-security research with children. We conducted surveys of 189 3rd to 8th graders from two Midwest schools in the USA. We found that children have on average two passwords for school and three to four passwords for home. They kept their passwords private and did not share with others. They created passwords with an average length of 7 (3rd to 5th graders) and 10 (6\\u20138th graders). But, only about 13% of the children created very strong passwords. Generating strong passwords requires mature cognitive and linguistic capabilities which children at this developmental stage have not yet mastered. They believed that passwords provide access control, protect their privacy and keep their \\u201cstuff\\u201d safe. Overall, children had appropriate mental models of passwords and demonstrated good password practices. Cyber-security education should strive to reinforce these positive practices while continuing to provide and promote age-appropriate developmental security skills. Given the study\\u2019s sample size and limited generalizability, we are expanding our research to include children from 3rd to 12th graders across multiple US school districts.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Cybersecurity ; volume 5, issue 1 ; ISSN 2057-2085 2057-2093\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Choong, Yee-Yin; Theofanos, Mary F; Renaud, Karen; Prior, Suzanne\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/cybsec\\/tyz015\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"4896677552bbdde993ad8c5671edc73a6fe34a096e08dc2108b05477be7948e5\",\"relevance\":56,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/cybsec\\/tyz015\"},{\"id\":\"f60b61a43b83d2cbc0bae1b0d2f2d937527d3aa9ed39708a354d5683b3ca8a3b\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.3167\\/nc.2019.140103; hal-02608307; https:\\/\\/hal.inrae.fr\\/hal-02608307; doi:10.3167\\/nc.2019.140103; IRSTEA: PUB00059538\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.inrae.fr\\/hal-02608307; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3167\\/nc.2019.140103\",\"title\":\"The Stuff of Soil: Below-ground agency in the making of future climates ; Mati\\u00e8re de sol: l'agentivit\\u00e9 souterraine dans la fabrique des climats du futur\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Despite its vital ecological importance, the significance of soil as a belowground tridimensional living world remains under-theorised in social and cultural research.

Evaluation of performance of genotypes at a number of locations provides useful information to determine their adaptation and stability. The objectives of the study were to estimate the magnitude of genotype-environment interaction (G \\u00d7 E), to determine its effects, and to identify stable tef genotypes. In the study, twelve genotypes of tef were evaluated in seven environments in the Northeast part of Ethiopia. The result showed that effects of genotype, environment and the G \\u00d7 E were significant and explained 5.08%, 82.67% and 12.25% of the treatment variance signifying that environment was the predominant contributor of the variation. The AMMI analysis showed that five of the IPCAs were significant. The first two, being very important, explained 66.04% and 20.35% of the G \\u00d7 E variance, respectively. The AMMI2 biplot showed that genotypes 202416A, 202382A and 205958 were not affected by environmental fluctuations as they had minimum interaction.

The wellbeing of children at school was influenced by the quality of the relationships they had with their teachers. Children recognized teachers as being essential agents in their learning process and teaching them essential skills for their future. Children who described feeling positive about school were children who felt that their teachers were supportive, provided creative ways to learn, and listened to their ideas and concerns. Conversely, children who described negative feelings about school discussed experiencing teachers who did not value their ideas and concerns, and were not supportive in their individual needs as a learner.

Modern world leaders are already actively preparing for a new era \\u2013 the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is based on the concept of fully networked and adaptive production with intelligent systems. However, in order to use the full potential of it, changes in the labor market are needed in accordance with changing requirements and, since it is people who are the key success factors. Purpose. The purpose of the article is to study the impact of Fourth Industrial Revolution in the global industry on the staff of the enterprise. Results. The universal nature of the new industrial model proposed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, opens up the opportunity for a new industrial revolution, as a result of which the Fourth Industrial Revolution will become a new global industrial milestone and a standard for the development of the real sector of the economy all over the world. The future is for superprofessional skills and abilities. These skills are universal and important for specialists in various industries. Mastering them allows the employee to increase the efficiency of professional activity in industry, and also makes it possible to move between sectors, while maintaining his relevance. The FIR will affect absolutely all industries, but our research is devoted to new professions in the industry. Accordingly, through the prism of industry, we will consider changes in the professions. The most significant changes are expected in robotics and engineering. The following occupations are expected: Industrial robotics designer, Designer ergonomist, Operator of multifunctional robotic systems, Engineer composer, Home robots\\u2019 designer, Medical robots\\u2019 designer, Child robot\\u2019s designer and Robots neurointerface designer. At the intersection of management and production may cause such professions: Production coordinator in distributed communities, Trendvotcher \\/ Forsyter, Cross-cultural communication manager, Moderator user communities, Online sales manager. Conclusion. The Fourth industrial revolution will substantially change all spheres of life, including professional ones. As the study showed, the future of interdisciplinary professions. Employees get many benefits and comfort with a new way of working, but learning will be needed during a professional life, so the company needs strong partners. For a successful path to FIR, there are a variety of opportunities for lifelong learning and organization of work that contributes to learning. Both professional and academic training require a continuous dialogue between industry, politics and society to constantly evolve and adapt.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-04\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fourth industrial revolution; stuff; superprofessional skills; robotics; engineering\",\"subject\":\"Fourth industrial revolution; stuff; superprofessional skills; robotics; engineering\",\"authors\":\"\\u0411\\u0430\\u0448\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f, \\u0406\\u0440\\u0438\\u043d\\u0430 \\u041e\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u0434\\u0440\\u0456\\u0432\\u043d\\u0430; \\u0422\\u0440\\u0443\\u0445\\u0430\\u0447\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430, \\u0421\\u043e\\u0444\\u0456\\u044f \\u041b\\u0435\\u043e\\u043d\\u0456\\u0434\\u0456\\u0432\\u043d\\u0430; Bashynska, I.

A Visitor\\u2019s Guide to Berlin\\u2019s Museum der Dinge\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Museology has shifted its focus in some places of the world: artefacts and historical objects are being repatriated, returned as permanent loans, institutions are questioning the ownership of indigenous objects, selections are made by kids, and texts are being written by visitors. The following case study discusses the reprioritization of a dynamic imagination around a museum\\u2019s purpose in a jejune way, from the perspective of an independent cultural worker, trained in visual communication and schooled in visual ethnography. The text, a non-linear narrative of the visitor's experience, is interspersed with excerpts from a recorded conversation between two visitors of the Werkbundarchiv \\u2013 Museum der Dinge, Berlin. The Museum of Things does more than try to find a place for the Werkbund \\u201cstuff,\\u201d it opens up a continuous material dialogue that includes different perspectives on the history of design in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Founded in Munich, in 1907, the Deutscher Werkbund or the German Association of Craftsmen was the organisation of artists, artisans and architects that strove to ensure good design and craftsmanship in times of mass-production of goods and architecture. The Made in Germany label is commonly associated with durable products and viable design precisely due to the work of the Deutscher Werkbund, which made efforts to create those associations linked today with German architecture or industrial, commercial, and household German products. A visit to this museum can last forever due to the extra satirical layer, combining ethnographic methods with personal narratives. This text is a sample of a specific visitor experience in an unusual educational institution that, using almost exclusively analogue methods, reaches remarkable levels of interactivity.\",\"published_in\":\"Martor, Vol 23, Pp 201-206 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"museum; visual anthropology; objects; things; berlin; interactive; testimony; deutscher werkbund; museum der dinge; Ethnology.

We wish to pursue in this study that, beyond technological considerations, it is necessary to expand the scope of child protection by establishing mutual collaboration between regulators, distributors and video on demand services, as well as consumers and parents\\u2019 organisations, in an effort to further enhance cooperation and mutual understanding (European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, 2017b, p. 75). It is for this reason that we believe that the academic sphere can also be invited into this wide-ranging discussion on child protection to contribute reflections on a key aspect: audiovisual and media education, an essential pillar of protection in addition to filters, external limits, and electronic labelling. We thus uphold a vision that not only considers the \\u201cdigital stuff\\u201d but also highlights the need for \\u201cethos stuff\\u201d (Goggin, 2008, p.89). In this respect, we have considered it essential a literature review on the concept of media literacy. Secondly, our qualitative methodology involves an analysis of the instructions issued by the European Union and their implementation in Spain. In this stage, we have conducted desk research based on a narrative analysis of the documents and programs of different institutions in order to chart the evolution of the question in recent years, at a time when the digital environment has changed more quickly than ever before. This same type of analysis is also conducted on the initiatives of European and Spanish companies to determine whether they are implementing child protection strategies.\",\"published_in\":\"Comunica\\u00e7\\u00e3o e Sociedade; vol. 37 (2020): Crian\\u00e7as, jovens e media: perspetivas atuais; 127-146 ; Comunica\\u00e7\\u00e3o e Sociedade; Vol 37 (2020): Children, youth and media: current perspectives; 127-146 ; 2183-3575 ; 1645-2089\",\"year\":\"2020-06-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Labio-Bernal, Aurora; Romero-Dom\\u00ednguez, Lorena R.; Garc\\u00eda-Orta, Mar\\u00eda Jos\\u00e9\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/revistacomsoc.pt\\/article\\/view\\/2162\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"30f64dcb81b4affcaa85bc6518ff2c02fb7f6b7c5bb47a803a186d50c17c8c96\",\"relevance\":32,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"b8d519e1b6592016efba965ac790aa7ac528b59c2f7fa309d3761778a1c41dd9\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/450037; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.paid.2019.06.019\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/450037; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.paid.2019.06.019\",\"title\":\"The benefits of being less fixated on self and stuff: Nonattachment, reduced insecurity, and reduced materialism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Materialism has often been considered as a means of attaining a more positive sense of self within a consumer culture. In two undergraduate samples (N = 248, 183), the current study assessed the extent to which various forms of insecurity (i.e., low self-esteem, public self-consciousness, relative deprivation, anxious attachment, fear of death) mediate the relationship between the Buddhist construct of nonattachment and materialism. In line with expectations, greater nonattachment was directly associated with reduced materialism in both samples. Nonattachment was also found to be indirectly associated with reduced materialism via reduced public self-consciousness and relative deprivation. Self-esteem, anxious attachment, and fear of death did not mediate the relationship between nonattachment and materialism. The findings therefore indicate that the acceptance and non-contingent sense of self typical of nonattachment may play an important role in minimising the experience or impact of insecurity that can contribute to materialism, as well as minimising the importance placed on material goals.\",\"published_in\":\"Personality and Individual Differences, Vol. 149 (Oct 2019), pp. 302-308\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Elphinstone, Brad; Whitehead, Richard\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/450037\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"b8d519e1b6592016efba965ac790aa7ac528b59c2f7fa309d3761778a1c41dd9\",\"relevance\":31,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"63cc99c1c6b20983cf76ff1cd76e748c3a26e56cfeaeda403744937e0d872bb7\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.psmpublishers.org\\/index.php\\/biolres\\/article\\/view\\/293\\/227; https:\\/\\/journals.psmpublishers.org\\/index.php\\/biolres\\/article\\/view\\/293\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.psmpublishers.org\\/index.php\\/biolres\\/article\\/view\\/293\",\"title\":\"Gelatin; Switch back to Halal: A Mini-Review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Gelatin is a traditional functional protein with water-soluble properties and has the potential of forming transparent gels under certain conditions.

This paper shifts the focus from the stuff that is being positioned as money to the social totality. Credit theorists claim that commodity theories of money imply monetary neutrality and a primacy of real analysis. In contrast, this paper argues based on Marx and Smith that, independently of whether money is a commodity or credit, the necessity of money depends on the constitution of the economy in terms of the relation between production and circulation. If social production is constituted through the exchange between private specialised producers, money is not neutral but essential. For Smith, real analysis is nevertheless meaningful, in that, he treats the spheres of exchange and production separately. By contrast, Marx exposes real analysis as commodity fetishism and stresses the mutually constitutive social relations between money, commodity exchange and capitalist production.\",\"published_in\":\"Cambridge Journal of Economics ; volume 43, issue 6, page 1459-1483 ; ISSN 0309-166X 1464-3545\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Economics and Econometrics\",\"subject\":\"Economics and Econometrics\",\"authors\":\"Weber, Isabella M\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/cje\\/bez038\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8b0e29cbc015cdc92c3e96f45717403dd2049d953fabe2acad6e8f8c337b818d\",\"relevance\":25,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/cje\\/bez038\"},{\"id\":\"b2baf01ed443503f747b5adb1beb01bf29ba467bf078b2fce3b9e53e89c56aa2\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/melus\\/mlaa013; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/melus\\/article-pdf\\/45\\/2\\/70\\/33335585\\/mlaa013.pdf\",\"title\":\"Differentiation, Entanglement, and Worth in Ruth Ozeki\\u2019s A Tale for the Time Being\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Ruth Ozeki's 2013 novel A Tale for the Time Being suggests that garbage provides the raw material for meaning-making, an emphasis evident in both the content and the structure of the novel. Constructed as an assemblage of curated texts discarded and washed up on shore, the novel follows characters who wonder whether their own identities and communities are collages of flotsam whose worth is dependent on arbitrary judgments and accidental encounters.

This study evaluates the concept of surge capacity, which intends to achieve a balance between the needs and resources in affected areas by providing staff, stuff, structure, and system. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed according to the PRISMA statement and by using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and related keywords. Results: There were limited publications about flexible surge capacity (FSC). However, the sum of data obtained indicated the need for flexibility in expanding major incidents or disasters, demanding new resources, which may neither be available on time nor reachable due to infrastructural damage. Conclusion: FSC is a novel concept based on international guidelines. It refers to the extra and adjustable human and material resources that can be mobilized by activating nonprofessional but educated staff and different but accepted facilities in a fast, smooth, and productive way. Public health and public education play an essential role in obtaining such flexibility.\",\"published_in\":\"Health Promotion Perspectives ; volume 10, issue 3, page 175-179 ; ISSN 2228-6497\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Khorram-Manesh, Amir\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.34172\\/hpp.2020.30\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a2e991c3a5572e20fd2a69bba8be3efdd8b6efae352bb12f4d05d3c28b11a7fc\",\"relevance\":9,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.34172\\/hpp.2020.30\"},{\"id\":\"5c4d470a7f9bba55eaaa6457299808e32152404c9f080f64b8732b47d2be9e2d\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.2616462; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2616463; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2616463; oai:zenodo.org:2616463\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2616463; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2616463\",\"title\":\"MECHANISM FORMATION OF STUFF POLICY BY DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article widely discusses the theoretical foundations of personnel policy, defines the role of personnel policy in the effective development of an organization, identifies types of personnel policy.

By collecting cases of accidents include fire disaster, terrorist attack, flood, earthquake and stampede that happened in subway stations or on trains around the world, the causes, consequence and their own characters were analysed. Besides, some recommendations and beneficial measures aim to prevent these disasters mentioned above were also presented and discussed.\",\"published_in\":\"MATEC Web of Conferences, Vol 272, p 01031 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Engineering (General).

Additionally, 10 mm thick Super Stuff pink wax bolus and paraffin wax bolus materials were placed on the right eyelid of a patient. Using electron dose calculation algorithm and ion chamber measurements, dosimetric comparisons were made in the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Both for measured and calculated dose, values were acquired 3 times and averaged for each case. Resulting differences are expressed as percentage differences. Dose differences were obtained in measurements with and without using bolus at several locations of the solid phantom, performed by the Roos Ion chamber. Dosimetric differences of 7-7.5% for Superflab, 10-10.5% for paraffin bolus and 13-14% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus are obtained. Besides, when dosimetric comparisons are made in the treatment planning system for cases with and without bolus; Dose differences were calculated to be 2-2.5% for superflab silicon bolus, 3-3.5% for paraffin wax bolus and 5-6% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus. To increase skin dose in curved anatomical structures in radiotherapy, it is safe to use the paraffin wax bolus material in radiotherapy clinic, as an alternative to Superflab silicon bolus and Super Stuff pink wax bolus materials, due to its low cost and ease of conforming to body surface contours.

Delay of all elective cases, restriction of surgical treatment of fractures with relative indications for surgery are recommended. The segregation of cases into COVID-19 confirmed or suspected and COVID-19 negative patients is important. When possible before the admission to in-patient department the patient shall be tested on COVID-19. When the COVID-19 status of the patient is unclear all possible protection measures shall be used: patient isolation and medical stuff protection. To prevent the spread of infection it is recommended to split the stuff of the traumacenter into 2 or 3 groups. Each of the groups is working during the week with subsequent period of the self-isolation (remote work) for the period of 1-2 weeks (according to the duration of incubation period of the COVID-19). During the surgical treatment the most dangerous stages of the surgery are endotracheal intubation \\/ extubation and also aerosol-generative procedures: electrocoagulation, pulsed wound lavage, drilling, the use of oscillating saw and medullary reaming. The stuff in the OP-theatre has to be accordingly equipped (personal protection equipment).

In conversational data, the most frequent forms cited as examples of this category are or something , and everything , and things and and stuff , which are described as \\u2018coordination tags\\u2019 by Biber et al. (1999: 115\\u201316). This label has not been widely adopted, but the linguistic category it describes has clearly become established as part of modern English. The term \\u2018general extender\\u2019 (Overstreet, 1999) is now commonly used to refer to this category: \\u2018\\u201cgeneral\\u201d because they are nonspecific and \\u201cextender\\u201d because they extend otherwise complete utterances\\u2019 (1999: 3). There are two subcategories: adjunctive general extenders, beginning with and , and disjunctive general extenders, beginning with or . In casual conversation, general extenders are typically phrase- or clause-final, consisting of and\\/or plus a vague noun ( stuff\\/things ) or a pronoun ( something\\/everything ), with an optional comparative phrase ( like that\\/this ). In everyday spoken British English, the phrase and (all) that is also extremely common. In written and formal spoken English, forms with quite different structures, such as et cetera , and so on, and so forth , and or so are more typically used to fulfill related functions. All of these forms are grammatically optional and fall within the more general category of pragmatic markers, along with you know , I mean , like and sort of , \\u2018expressions which may have little obvious propositional meaning but which oil the wheels of conversational social interaction\\u2019 (Beeching, 2016: 1).

KiP is an epistemological perspective that views knowledge as a complex system of many types of knowledge elements. These include the so-called explanatory primitives (e-prims), that is, intuitive knowledge elements that people use when interpreting the world. The aim of this study was to gauge the potential of KiP in the field of research on pre-instructional conceptual knowledge in the geosciences by analysing conceptions of the complex hydrological issue of the formation of water springs. When probing student explanations of springs for e-prims in two case studies involving 12-year-old boys, we identified two explanatory primitives not previously documented.

The way this stuff is accommodated in dwellings can significantly affect residents\\u2019 quality of life and well-being. This paper presents a new conceptualisation of material possessions that could be of use to those involved in housing design. Three universal characteristics of material possessions; value, temporality and visibility are used to identify the space in the home that possessions might require. A conceptual framework that integrates these characteristics with spatial information about the interior of the home is developed. The paper argues that the conceptual framework could help designers, policymakers and house builders to better understand first the nature of material possessions, and second how those possessions could be accommodated in contemporary homes, ultimately supporting improved quality of life and wellbeing for households. architectural design; design practice; interior design; housing; storage; Architecture; NA1-9428 Interiority, Vol 3, Iss 2, Pp 219-242 (2020) Elena Marco; Katie Williams; Sonja Oliveira\"},{\"id\":\"5ff4483d8292375dfdc114660990f945719b3a110586330e9158b698d9f069b6\",\"content\":\"Social stuff' and all that jazz: understanding the residual category of social sustainability Recently we have seen a substantial increase in pressure for industries, such as aquaculture, to become more sustainable.

Ennio Morricone, who died in July this year, was one of a handful of composers in film history who could comfortably claim to be one of the latter: from the moment he shot to international prominence in the 1960s, cinema has always been and will always be part Morricone. He wrote more than 500 film and television scores over the course of a 60-year career; he redefined ossified cinematic genres; and perhaps most toweringly of all, with his collaborations with director Sergio Leone, he composed some of the few snatches of film music that are easily recognised by those who do not easily recognise film music.

This paper reports on the main findings of yarning interviews with 14 Indigenous researchers, that was central to a project analysing the role of research training infrastructures in strengthening the Indigenous health research workforce in Australia. The findings highlighted Indigenous researcher peers as core sources of inspiration, moral support and sustenance in academia and in life. Peer generative power arising from peer groups provide a unique enriching to the educational and research experience. Indigenous researcher peers have a strong shared aspiration to champion change to health research and higher education as a key pathway to widespread positive impacting on health and well-being. We suggest the (revived) development at a collective level of a strategic and planned approach to capitalising on the positive outcomes of peer generated leadership and support.

Despite the community's efforts in data collection, there are still few image datasets covering a wide range of scenes and object categories with dense and detailed annotations for scene parsing. In this paper, we introduce and analyze the ADE20K dataset, spanning diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases even parts of parts. A scene parsing benchmark is built upon the ADE20K with 150 object and stuff classes included. Several segmentation baseline models are evaluated on the benchmark. A novel network design called Cascade Segmentation Module is proposed to parse a scene into stuff, objects, and object parts in a cascade and improve over the baselines. We further show that the trained scene parsing networks can lead to applications such as image content removal and scene synthesis. \\u00a92017 Paper presented at the 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017), July 21-26, 2017, Honolulu, Hawaii. ; NSF (grant no. 1524817)  MIT web domain Zhou, Bolei; Zhao, Hang; Puig Fernandez, Francesco Xavier; Fidler, Sanja; Barriuso, Adela; Torralba, Antonio\"},{\"id\":\"fd21e04a6336dcc6f488fe3d7820acd2616a4ec6c1b9e81e154b1ad361430317\",\"content\":\"It had a lot of cultural stuff in it: HIV-serodiscordant African American couples' experiences of a culturally congruent sexual health intervention Objective: The increased life expectancy of people living with HIV has brought about an increase in serodiscordant couples, in which there is risk of HIV transmission. Therefore, interventions that promote sexual health and reduce risk are critical to develop for these couples. Given the disproportionate burden of HIV among populations of color, it is also critical that these interventions are culturally congruent. The EBAN intervention for African American serodiscordant couples recognizes the centrality of culture in shap\\u00ading sexual behaviors and helps couples develop intimacy and positive prevention behaviors. The analytic objective of our study was to examine the knowledge and awareness gained by participants in the intervention. Participants: Participants (n=17) who com\\u00adpleted at least half of the eight intervention sessions. Methods: Brief post-implementation semi-structured interviews were conducted be\\u00adtween January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Team-based, targeted content analysis focused on knowledge and awareness gains. Results: Participants described learning about sexual health, expanded sexual options, and sexual communication. The \\u201cEBAN caf\\u00e9,\\u201d a component that gives couples a menu of options for safer sex behaviors, was particularly popular. Partici\\u00adpants also noted the value of learning how to communicate with one another about their sexual health-related concerns and preferences. They appreciated the \\u201ccultural stuff\\u201d that was infused throughout the ses\\u00adsions, including the emphasis on learning from one another as couples. Conclusions: Couples at risk for HIV trans\\u00admission benefit from strengthening skills and knowledge related to healthy sexual\\u00adity. A behavioral intervention that aligns with cultural values and imparts culturally congruent sexual health information appeals to couples who seek ways to enhance their intimacy and sexual options while also re\\u00adducing risk.

Using posts (n = 975) on Facebook pages and tweets (n = 889) on Twitter handles of Stuff.co.nz and NZHerald.co.nz from 12 November to 17 November, we analysed how media users reacted to breaking news coverage of a major natural disaster. The results show that quake news gets significantly more interaction and reactions than non-quake news on both social media platforms. For Twitter, quake news gets significantly more interactions such as likes, and retweets, but not replies. However, for Facebook, quake news gets significantly more comments, likes, wows, and sad emotional feedbacks, but no significant difference in emotions such as love, haha, and angry. The emotions people have on Facebook indicate well the nature of the news. With Facebook\\u2019s new function of reactions including, like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry, makes reactions more expressive and relevant.

The goal of this study is to explore children\\u2019s practices, perceptions, and knowledge regarding passwords. Given the limited work to date and that the world\\u2019s cyber posture and culture will be dependent on today\\u2019s youth, it is imperative to conduct cyber-security research with children. We conducted surveys of 189 3rd to 8th graders from two Midwest schools in the USA. We found that children have on average two passwords for school and three to four passwords for home. They kept their passwords private and did not share with others. They created passwords with an average length of 7 (3rd to 5th graders) and 10 (6\\u20138th graders). But, only about 13% of the children created very strong passwords. Generating strong passwords requires mature cognitive and linguistic capabilities which children at this developmental stage have not yet mastered. They believed that passwords provide access control, protect their privacy and keep their \\u201cstuff\\u201d safe. Overall, children had appropriate mental models of passwords and demonstrated good password practices. Cyber-security education should strive to reinforce these positive practices while continuing to provide and promote age-appropriate developmental security skills.

A deep understanding of the essence of the system approach to ensuring the quality of higher education requires the study of the best world practices. The article is aimed to analyze implementation strategies of quality assurance policy within Israeli system of higher education. The case of Israel illustrates implementation of a system for assessing and assuring quality standards in higher education that is recognized as one of the highest national priorities. Quality assurance at Israeli higher education institutions is regulated by The Quality Assessment and Assurance Division. Nevertheless, Israeli Council for Higher Education promotes culture of establishing internal mechanisms to assure academic quality. The case study of quality assurance strategies in Israeli higher education institutions was focused on the analysis of key activities managed by teaching and learning centers. These centers are dedicated to professional development of faculty members to promote learning outcome of study programs through innovative teaching methodologies.

By deliberately choosing natural science examples to illustrate each section, the article conducts a thought experiment in how Romance Studies research might fruitfully remind twenty-first-century sciences and information technologies of their intercultural roots, and that theirs are not superior, or distinctive, intellectual domains. The article then clarifies not only a co-equal place for Humanities\\u2019 insights, but also how these are already equipped to ascertain features of optimal adaptability for the greater potential

Drawing on the reading of scientific literature and a series of interviews with scientists working at the juncture of soil and climate research, this article pursues a picture that highlights soil\\u2019s capacities to shape future climates, including by fostering major planetary tipping points; we elaborate on the cultural and ethical significance of that picture for opening up alternative stories in which agency and change are not human-only pre\\u00acrogatives. We develop a critical stance on the growing expectations of storing more carbon into soils and argue for a better consideration of the situated, heterogeneous, and volatile dynamics of carbon within soils. We eventually call for more responsible ways of thinking about, and caring for, the myriad conglomerates of living, decaying, and dead matter that basically make up the stuff of soil. 160808 - Sociology and Social Studies of Science and Technology; 160802 - Environmental Sociology; 970116 - Expanding Knowledge through Studies of Human Society; soils; soil science; carbon sequestration; climatic changes  Granjou, Celine; Salazar, Juan Francisco (R11072)\"},{\"id\":\"50c64190c193cf0aeb9399c1eff3ce04da61fa3e85ff3a1f27ca2d4524621f9c\",\"content\":\"Multimodality and media archaeology: complementary optics for looking at digital stuff? This article brings current core concerns of multimodality into dialogue with approaches identified with media archaeology. I begin by considering the development of multimodality in relation to the emphasis that media archaeologists place on non-linear and parallel histories, the relativity of \\u2018newness\\u2019, and cyclical thinking. I then move on to consider some of the respective conceptual undergirding of multimodality and media archaeology, focussing on key issues of materiality and media specificity, signs and signals, media convergence and commensurability. I argue that this juxtaposition brings fresh perspectives to the question of \\u2018mode\\u2019. Significantly, these are attuned both to social and formal considerations, but in ways that differ from both social semiotic orientations and other approaches to multimodality. Having considered these fundamentals, I turn to questions of interactivity, product, and process, and the blurring of boundaries between categories such as reading and writing. As a final intersection, I bring the growing interest in integrating quantitative, corpus-based methods in multimodal analysis into dialogue with the prioritization of the digital archive as a site of specific media archaeological interest with inherent potential for algorithmic manipulation. I conclude with some observations about the status of multimodality and media archaeology as communities and, more specifically, the potential for complementarity between them.

Our investigation led us to understand that all particles are made up of the same stuff we called konke, Something that has experimental backing. Understanding that this konke must get into relationships so that we get particles, we have a chance to look at particles from what they are made off understanding. It is how much of konke that gives a particle mass and its categorization. What is the nature of magnetism from the viewpoint that all things are made of the same stuff, konke.

Therefore, interventions that promote sexual health and reduce risk are critical to develop for these couples. Given the disproportionate burden of HIV among populations of color, it is also critical that these interventions are culturally congruent. The EBAN intervention for African American serodiscordant couples recognizes the centrality of culture in shaping sexual behaviors and helps couples develop intimacy and positive prevention behaviors. The analytic objective of our study was to examine the knowledge and awareness gained by participants in the intervention. Participants: Participants (n=17) who completed at least half of the eight intervention sessions. Methods: Brief post-implementation semi-structured interviews were conducted between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Team-based, targeted content analysis focused on knowledge and awareness gains. Results: Participants described learning about sexual health, expanded sexual options, and sexual communication.

Drawing on the reading of scientific literature and a series of interviews with scientists working at the juncture of soil and climate research, this article pursues a picture that highlights soil's capacities to shape future climates, including by fostering major planetary tipping points; we elaborates on the cultural and ethical significance of that picture for opening up alternative stories in which agency and change are not human-only prerogatives. We develop a critical stance on the growing expectations of storing more carbon into soils and argue for a better consideration of the situated, heterogeneous, and volatile dynamics of carbon within soils. We eventually call for more responsible ways of thinking about, and caring for, the myriad conglomerates of living, decaying, and dead matter which basically make up the stuff of soil.

There are three contexts of the problem: of comparison, of change and of interaction. Philosophical explanations of facts indicated in the three contexts need reference to properties and to a proper understanding of a relationship between them and their bearers. My aim is to get closer to this understanding with the use of some models but previously I present the substantialist theory of object and shortly argue for its main theses. The two models enabling us the understanding of the subject\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093properties structure are: the plastic stuff model and the functional model. On the ground of the first a subject is compared to a piece of plastic stuff which is informed by different shapes. Properties are ways how a subject is, they \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cgive\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d some \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfigure\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d to a subject. The core idea of the second model is that essences (performing the role of subjects) are immanent functional laws governing correlations of properties. As such they are similar to mathematical functions which are saturated by values. The relationship between a subject and properties can be grasped by analogy to such a saturation.

The employment of such labels will shape how the young person is perceived by the adults surrounding them. This will not only have an impact on the relationships that are developed between the pupil and the educator but also how the young people see themselves in terms of their own identity. This paper seeks to give voice and explore the position of young people within the confines of their educational experiences. The paper draws on 13 in-depth case studies to reflect on how young people experience the SEBD labels attached to them by others and what pupils consider to be the main antecedents leading them to display behaviour which is deemed unacceptable in the classroom. The paper highlights the importance of providing opportunities for young people to have their voice heard to fill the gap between professional perceptions and those of the pupil. In order to truly understand why young people display behaviour that is considered difficult and how they experience the labels we attach to them we have to speak to young people themselves.

(Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) The red flour weevil, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst 1797) is a pervasive pest, polyphagous which is becoming increasingly resistant to the normal insecticides. Finding alternative insecticides to those because of their inefficiency pollute the environment and poison consumers is an emergency. An ethno-botanical survey conducted with about 300 farmers in the Far North region of Cameroon identified 15 local plants insecticides associated with food during storage in combination with two or three others. Among these plants, the most used are Hyptis spicigera (Lamiaceae) 78%, Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) 76.6% and Vepris heterophylla (Rutaceae) 28,33% which is more used in mountain area. The powders of these single plants are insecticides on T. castaneum, however A. indica single or in combination with H. spicigera gives better insecticidal efficacy 73.33% and 66.67% mortality respectively.Keywords: Tribolium castaneum, stocked food stuff, combination, vegetal powder, insecticide Tribolium castaneum; stocked food stuff; combination; vegetal powder; insecticide International Journal of Biological and Chemical Sciences; Vol 13, No 3 (2019); 1613-1620 ; 1997-342X ; 1991-8631 Ayiki, Ev\\u00e9l\\u00e9 Nathanael; Tamgno, B\\u00e9ranger Raoul; Madou, Chantal; Vatsou, J\\u00e9r\\u00e9mie; Ngassoum, Martin Benoit; Ngamo Tinkeu, L\\u00e9onard Simon\"},{\"id\":\"9fb1c6872b573975c1525fc0305bd7df27aaddd00a79fcf8e4ed77ad3b952f83\",\"content\":\"Paparan selektif penggunaan fitur senyap dan teman dekat pada twitter dan instagram Social media has become a part of human\\u2019s life. Social Networking Sites or SNS which a part of social media allows the users to create their own network. Not only that but users can also choose their friends, what kind of content they want to see, what kind of relationship then want to have, or to keep certain content just for a few people to see through social media. A few features like mute feature to close friends feature are there for users to use on Twitter and Instagram. This research will try to find out how those features are being used by the users and why those features are needed. In depth interview is used to six informants who use the mute and close friend feature on Twitter or Instagram. Selective exposure theory is used to see how someone is more interested in seeing contents that match their believes and interests. It shows that mute feature is used to filter some stuff that they want to see and avoid things they don\\u2019t like. The mute feature also useful for keeping the relationship in a good term between the users and other people. Meanwhile, close friends feature is used to maintain the connection users have with a few people where they can share stuff to those people only. Users also think that close friends feature is useful to protect their privacy. : teori paparan selektif; jejaring sosial; media sosial; fitur senyap; teman dekat; Communication.

Drawing on the reading of scientific literature and a series of interviews with scientists working at the juncture of soil and climate research, this article pursues a picture that highlights soil\\u2019s capacities to shape future climates, including by fostering major planetary tipping points; we elaborate on the cultural and ethical significance of that picture for opening up alternative stories in which agency and change are not human-only pre\\u00acrogatives.

Secondly, to assess the quality of aSCR evidence for the Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH) during the IGT. Finally, to evaluate the reliability of current psychophysiological measurements on the IGT. Electronic databases, journals and reference lists were examined for inclusion. Data were extracted by two reviewers and validated by another reviewer, using a standardised extraction sheet along with a quality assessment. Two meta-analyses of aSCR measures were conducted to test the relationship between overall aSCR and IGT performance, and differences in aSCR between advantageous and disadvantageous decks. Twenty studies were included in this review. Quality assessment revealed that five studies did not measure anticipatory responses, and few stated they followed standard IGT and\\/or psychophysiological procedures. The first meta-analysis of 15 studies revealed a significant, small-to-medium relationship between aSCR and IGT performance (r= .22). The second meta-analysis of eight studies revealed a significant, small difference in aSCR between the advantageous and disadvantageous decks (r= .10); however, publication bias is likely to be an issue. Meta-analyses revealed aSCR evidence supporting the SMH. However, inconsistencies in the IGT and psychophysiological methods, along with publication bias, cast doubt on these effects. It is recommended that future tests of the SMH use a range of psychophysiological measures, a standardised IGT protocol, and discriminate between advantageous and disadvantageous decks. ; N\\/A Decision-making; Emotion; Reward  Simonovic, Boban; Stupple, Edward J.

Using classic Delphi technique and pairwise comparison, the components were given to 32 specialists in emergency medicine, nuclear medicine, medical physics, nuclear physics, radiobiology and radiation protection, health in disaster and emergency, and passive defense. Finally, the national model was developed by holding two focus group sessions.Results: The results from the two rounds of Delphi technique showed that 31 factors of preparedness were classified into three main classes, namely staff, stuff, and structure (system). Only three factors were excluded and the rest were agreed upon by the specialists. Given the weight of each class, it was found that staff preparedness and stuff preparedness had the highest and lowest priorities, respectively.Conclusion: Comprehensive preparedness requires enhancing and promoting cultural, social, economic, and political levels. Indeed, all preparedness levels should be promoted in alignment with each other. Hence, governments should align their policies to manage such incidents.

However, a national disaster plan has not yet been established. Aim: From September 2017, representatives of seven regional emergency medical centers in Seoul met monthly and decided to investigate basic data for the future establishment of surge capacity planning. Methods: Staff, supply, space, and systems for surge capacity were surveyed in seven hospitals. The additional surveyed data were as follows: hospital incident command system and actual operational experience; performance of disaster drill; safety and security plan; estimation of surge capacity in normal operating conditions and extreme operating conditions; alternative therapeutic spaces; back-up plan to call non-duty medical staff; decontamination equipment; contingency plan for stuff shortage; etc. Results: All the hospitals reported they have hospital incident command systems and held disaster drills every year, however, the two hospitals (28.5%) had no real experience of hospital incident command system activation. Five hospitals (71.4%) did not have a safety and security plan. They replied they can treat average 7.7 emergency patients (Korean Triage and Acute scale (KTAS) \\u2264 3), 10 non-emergent patients (KTAS&gt;4), 0.9 surgical patients and 0.7 unstable patients simultaneously in normal operating conditions. In extreme operating conditions, they replied they can treat average 26.4 emergency patients (KTAS \\u2264 3), 54.3 non-emergent patients (KTAS&gt;4), 37 surgical patients and 2.3 unstable patients simultaneously. The two hospitals (28.5%) had no alternative therapeutic spaces, no back-up plan to call non-duty medical staff and no contingency plan for stuff shortage. Three hospitals (42.9%) did not have decontamination equipment. Discussion: The survey revealed the basic data for surge capacity planning in Seoul. Data from hospitals other than regional emergency medical centers should be collected for the completion of disaster plans.

The goal of this study is to explore children\\u2019s practices, perceptions, and knowledge regarding passwords. Given the limited work to date and that the world\\u2019s cyber posture and culture will be dependent on today\\u2019s youth, it is imperative to conduct cyber-security research with children. We conducted surveys of 189 3rd to 8th graders from two Midwest schools in the USA. We found that children have on average two passwords for school and three to four passwords for home. They kept their passwords private and did not share with others. They created passwords with an average length of 7 (3rd to 5th graders) and 10 (6\\u20138th graders). But, only about 13% of the children created very strong passwords. Generating strong passwords requires mature cognitive and linguistic capabilities which children at this developmental stage have not yet mastered. They believed that passwords provide access control, protect their privacy and keep their \\u201cstuff\\u201d safe. Overall, children had appropriate mental models of passwords and demonstrated good password practices. Cyber-security education should strive to reinforce these positive practices while continuing to provide and promote age-appropriate developmental security skills. Given the study\\u2019s sample size and limited generalizability, we are expanding our research to include children from 3rd to 12th graders across multiple US school districts.

The objectives of the study were to estimate the magnitude of genotype-environment interaction (G \\u00d7 E), to determine its effects, and to identify stable tef genotypes. In the study, twelve genotypes of tef were evaluated in seven environments in the Northeast part of Ethiopia. The result showed that effects of genotype, environment and the G \\u00d7 E were significant and explained 5.08%, 82.67% and 12.25% of the treatment variance signifying that environment was the predominant contributor of the variation. The AMMI analysis showed that five of the IPCAs were significant. The first two, being very important, explained 66.04% and 20.35% of the G \\u00d7 E variance, respectively. The AMMI2 biplot showed that genotypes 202416A, 202382A and 205958 were not affected by environmental fluctuations as they had minimum interaction. The GGE analysis showed that 50.12% and 33.47% of the GGE variance were captured by the first and the second IPCAs, respectively. Based on the stability statistics considered, the genotypes 205953 and 202416A could be recommended as desirable (high yielding and stable) genotypes on the locations (environments) under study; both can be used as parents for future tef crossing programs. adaptability; ammi; gge; g\\u00d7e; stability; tef; Agriculture; S; Food processing and manufacture; TP368-456 Cogent Food & Agriculture, Vol 6, Iss 1 (2020) Fisseha Worede; Towfik Mehadi; Senayit Wondimu\"},{\"id\":\"899326c2f3f4b33f2c6cbb9e92aed0a8a6f7ab5311a682732e89721bc1ea32f4\",\"content\":\"HUKUM JUAL BELI ON-LINE DENGAN KODE SEBAGAI HARGA PERSPEKTIF YUSUF AL-QARADHAWI (Studi Kasus: On-line Shop @FAMAS.STUFF) Adding the code behind the price is one way that almost all on-lineshop do.

The wellbeing of children at school was influenced by the quality of the relationships they had with their teachers. Children recognized teachers as being essential agents in their learning process and teaching them essential skills for their future. Children who described feeling positive about school were children who felt that their teachers were supportive, provided creative ways to learn, and listened to their ideas and concerns.

Modern world leaders are already actively preparing for a new era \\u2013 the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is based on the concept of fully networked and adaptive production with intelligent systems. However, in order to use the full potential of it, changes in the labor market are needed in accordance with changing requirements and, since it is people who are the key success factors. Purpose. The purpose of the article is to study the impact of Fourth Industrial Revolution in the global industry on the staff of the enterprise. Results. The universal nature of the new industrial model proposed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, opens up the opportunity for a new industrial revolution, as a result of which the Fourth Industrial Revolution will become a new global industrial milestone and a standard for the development of the real sector of the economy all over the world. The future is for superprofessional skills and abilities. These skills are universal and important for specialists in various industries. Mastering them allows the employee to increase the efficiency of professional activity in industry, and also makes it possible to move between sectors, while maintaining his relevance. The FIR will affect absolutely all industries, but our research is devoted to new professions in the industry. Accordingly, through the prism of industry, we will consider changes in the professions. The most significant changes are expected in robotics and engineering. The following occupations are expected: Industrial robotics designer, Designer ergonomist, Operator of multifunctional robotic systems, Engineer composer, Home robots\\u2019 designer, Medical robots\\u2019 designer, Child robot\\u2019s designer and Robots neurointerface designer. At the intersection of management and production may cause such professions: Production coordinator in distributed communities, Trendvotcher \\/ Forsyter, Cross-cultural communication manager, Moderator user communities, Online sales manager. Conclusion. The Fourth industrial revolution will substantially change all spheres of life, including professional ones. As the study showed, the future of interdisciplinary professions. Employees get many benefits and comfort with a new way of working, but learning will be needed during a professional life, so the company needs strong partners. For a successful path to FIR, there are a variety of opportunities for lifelong learning and organization of work that contributes to learning. Both professional and academic training require a continuous dialogue between industry, politics and society to constantly evolve and adapt.

A Visitor\\u2019s Guide to Berlin\\u2019s Museum der Dinge Museology has shifted its focus in some places of the world: artefacts and historical objects are being repatriated, returned as permanent loans, institutions are questioning the ownership of indigenous objects, selections are made by kids, and texts are being written by visitors. The following case study discusses the reprioritization of a dynamic imagination around a museum\\u2019s purpose in a jejune way, from the perspective of an independent cultural worker, trained in visual communication and schooled in visual ethnography. The text, a non-linear narrative of the visitor's experience, is interspersed with excerpts from a recorded conversation between two visitors of the Werkbundarchiv \\u2013 Museum der Dinge, Berlin. The Museum of Things does more than try to find a place for the Werkbund \\u201cstuff,\\u201d it opens up a continuous material dialogue that includes different perspectives on the history of design in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Founded in Munich, in 1907, the Deutscher Werkbund or the German Association of Craftsmen was the organisation of artists, artisans and architects that strove to ensure good design and craftsmanship in times of mass-production of goods and architecture. The Made in Germany label is commonly associated with durable products and viable design precisely due to the work of the Deutscher Werkbund, which made efforts to create those associations linked today with German architecture or industrial, commercial, and household German products. A visit to this museum can last forever due to the extra satirical layer, combining ethnographic methods with personal narratives. This text is a sample of a specific visitor experience in an unusual educational institution that, using almost exclusively analogue methods, reaches remarkable levels of interactivity. museum; visual anthropology; objects; things; berlin; interactive; testimony; deutscher werkbund; museum der dinge; Ethnology.

Insights contribute to the immediate need to advance knowledge and practice around prevention with this group. An arts-based approach, which included a two-day interactive drama workshop coupled with follow-up, peer-led focus groups, was used to explore perceptions and understandings related to intimate relationships with 15 tertiary educated young people (nine female and six male) from across Samoa. Intersectionality informed the data collection and thematic analysis, examining participants\\u2019 lived experiences and the ways multiple and intersecting identities interact within social and cultural systems to influence and inform these experiences. Outcomes highlight important tensions for young people, including the way in which age, gender, religion and sexuality interact with social hierarchies and power structures, socially prescribed gender norms, family structures and globalisation. This research provides insights that can inform the development of prevention strategies to address the root causes of intimate partner violence, building the knowledge and skills required for establishing intimate relationships free from violence with young people.

We wish to pursue in this study that, beyond technological considerations, it is necessary to expand the scope of child protection by establishing mutual collaboration between regulators, distributors and video on demand services, as well as consumers and parents\\u2019 organisations, in an effort to further enhance cooperation and mutual understanding (European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, 2017b, p. 75). It is for this reason that we believe that the academic sphere can also be invited into this wide-ranging discussion on child protection to contribute reflections on a key aspect: audiovisual and media education, an essential pillar of protection in addition to filters, external limits, and electronic labelling. We thus uphold a vision that not only considers the \\u201cdigital stuff\\u201d but also highlights the need for \\u201cethos stuff\\u201d (Goggin, 2008, p.89). In this respect, we have considered it essential a literature review on the concept of media literacy. Secondly, our qualitative methodology involves an analysis of the instructions issued by the European Union and their implementation in Spain. In this stage, we have conducted desk research based on a narrative analysis of the documents and programs of different institutions in order to chart the evolution of the question in recent years, at a time when the digital environment has changed more quickly than ever before. This same type of analysis is also conducted on the initiatives of European and Spanish companies to determine whether they are implementing child protection strategies.

In two undergraduate samples (N = 248, 183), the current study assessed the extent to which various forms of insecurity (i.e., low self-esteem, public self-consciousness, relative deprivation, anxious attachment, fear of death) mediate the relationship between the Buddhist construct of nonattachment and materialism. In line with expectations, greater nonattachment was directly associated with reduced materialism in both samples. Nonattachment was also found to be indirectly associated with reduced materialism via reduced public self-consciousness and relative deprivation. Self-esteem, anxious attachment, and fear of death did not mediate the relationship between nonattachment and materialism. The findings therefore indicate that the acceptance and non-contingent sense of self typical of nonattachment may play an important role in minimising the experience or impact of insecurity that can contribute to materialism, as well as minimising the importance placed on material goals.

However, in recent times initiatives have been taken in producing gelatin from Halal sources, such as fish, chicken and bovine slaughtered according to Islamic teachings. Therefore, we highlighted different porcine alternative derived gelatin sources and also methods to detect edible product adulterated with pork or other haram stuff.

Tracing how certain types of object and relationships with objects feature in works by Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie in the 1920s reveals that for each author, descriptions of interiors, and particularly the stuff that individuals accumulate in their homes, is central, and the presence of belongings vies with the absence of their owners. Considering the valences of furniture, scrap paper and curios shows how possessions continue to speak of the real even in writing that challenges realist modes of representation.

This paper shifts the focus from the stuff that is being positioned as money to the social totality. Credit theorists claim that commodity theories of money imply monetary neutrality and a primacy of real analysis. In contrast, this paper argues based on Marx and Smith that, independently of whether money is a commodity or credit, the necessity of money depends on the constitution of the economy in terms of the relation between production and circulation. If social production is constituted through the exchange between private specialised producers, money is not neutral but essential. For Smith, real analysis is nevertheless meaningful, in that, he treats the spheres of exchange and production separately. By contrast, Marx exposes real analysis as commodity fetishism and stresses the mutually constitutive social relations between money, commodity exchange and capitalist production.

Constructed as an assemblage of curated texts discarded and washed up on shore, the novel follows characters who wonder whether their own identities and communities are collages of flotsam whose worth is dependent on arbitrary judgments and accidental encounters. This essay examines how Ozeki excavates literary landfills to recuperate trashed narratives and devalued people, proposing that the very stuff cultures reject as worthless provides compost for the growth of new meaning. The essay further explores how Ozeki deploys the Schr\\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment to critique the process of assigning worth and posit the concept of entanglement as a foundation for construction of community.

Anatomy of the sex market at the dawn of the twentieth century Abstract Drawing on a rich legal dossier on a violation of obscenity laws (the Trafford affair), this article studies the formation of a sex market in early twentieth-century Paris. Books and erotic photographs, contraceptives, sex toys and remedies for increasing sexual potency: the diversity of these products relating to sexual practices is clearly revealed by the case. The dossier demonstrates how this commercial enterprise drew on the benefits of industrialization, mass media and globalization for building its client-base and developing a transnational dimension. It also allows us to understand the strategies deployed to keep the sale of these objects clandestine, in a context where they were increasingly overseen by the authorities, revealing innovative forms of commercial exchange, based on an epistolary transvestism.

Abstract The protagonists of Michel Gondry\\u2019s Be Kind Rewind recycle twice over, using junkyard stuff like tires and plastic bags to remake famous films in a series of no-budget shorts. This essay turns to Be Kind Rewind to ask how the recycling of materials may relate to the recycling of intellectual properties. It argues that such a question is paramount at a moment when adaptation not only represents a major media practice but also one major response to climate change. As such, the essay offers several different approaches to thinking about media adaptation in the age of global warming, drawing variously from sociologists, political ecologists, film theorists, and designers.

This study evaluates the concept of surge capacity, which intends to achieve a balance between the needs and resources in affected areas by providing staff, stuff, structure, and system. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed according to the PRISMA statement and by using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and related keywords. Results: There were limited publications about flexible surge capacity (FSC). However, the sum of data obtained indicated the need for flexibility in expanding major incidents or disasters, demanding new resources, which may neither be available on time nor reachable due to infrastructural damage. Conclusion: FSC is a novel concept based on international guidelines. It refers to the extra and adjustable human and material resources that can be mobilized by activating nonprofessional but educated staff and different but accepted facilities in a fast, smooth, and productive way. Public health and public education play an essential role in obtaining such flexibility.

Around the world, dye wastewater has turned out to be one of the fundamental reasons for several environmental pollution problems because of the increased noteworthy demand for textile products and the relative increment in production and application of engineered dyes. As a consequence, in the furtherance of waste water treatment, it has become both a major concern and imperative to treat the industrial effluent that originates from textile and dye stuff plants accounting for a continuous discharge of remnant dyes to the environment. For the same, the efficient treatment of this textile effluent in an eco- friendly manner has gained a lot of attention in contemporary days, reasoning from which is where the concept of Bioremediation intervenes and which was the core aspect of our project. In the present study, our focus in it?s totality has been on operating three different bacterial species namely Bacillus, Pseudomonas & Staphylococcus Aureus in pursuit of treating the industrial effluent incorporating synthetic dyes.

However, some stations and trains may be vulnerable when natural or man-made disasters happen, thus the safety of passengers and stuff is threatened. Therefore, it is meaningful to make a deep analysis to these disasters that may happen in subway stations and trains. By collecting cases of accidents include fire disaster, terrorist attack, flood, earthquake and stampede that happened in subway stations or on trains around the world, the causes, consequence and their own characters were analysed. Besides, some recommendations and beneficial measures aim to prevent these disasters mentioned above were also presented and discussed. Engineering (General).

For international tax lawyers, these are the normal operating parameters of the international tax regime. In fact, the same forces that are currently unraveling the World Trade Organization (WTO) are simultaneously enabling pragmatic and creative reforms of international tax law. Ruth Mason's account of the Transformation of International Tax invites us to draw broader lessons on how international economic law could adapt to survive and even thrive in a political environment increasingly hostile towards WTO-style multilateralism.

Vineyards are not only growing in Kakheti and Racha-Lechkhumi regions, but in almost every area of viticulture. In the process of primary grape harvesting and wine production, up to 25% waste is generated by solid parts of the grape bunches (bunch, skin, grape seed) and emptying, which are the best raw materials for making the curing-preventive powder, extracts, syrups, concentrates, pills, granules, alcohol, wine acid, grape seed oil, grape seed flour, nutriment paints, pectin, food fiber, tannin, granulated feed-stuff, the animal nutrition silage, fertilizers, etc. for the production of many other precious products. Therefore, it is more relevant to study the optimal technologies of recycling of secondary resources of thousands of tons of grape. grape; ; bunch; ; skin; ; grape seeds; ; emptying; ; extract; ; vine; ; waste Bulletin of Science and Practice 5(7) 128-134 Gvinianidze T.; Kamkamidze N.; Tsutskiridze N.\"}]"
