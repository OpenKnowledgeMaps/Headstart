Starting from ancient times, people today, and people in the future always want the same thing as happiness. The concept of happiness is not something new for both the world of Sufism and philosophy, therefore the concept of happiness experiences the dynamic development of the concept. Hamka is one of the scholars in Indonesia who discusses the concept of happiness, but Hamka has its own characteristics in explaining happiness. According to Hamka, happiness actually exists in every human being, happiness can be achieved from inside, not from outside, happiness that comes from outside of ourself is only as a complement to happiness inside, happiness can be achieved if humans always hone and develop tools which can be used to achieve happiness and these tools are religion, reason, and mind. These three things have a relationship with each other, if humans are able to develop these three things then humans can achieve happiness in their lives. In achieving happiness, these three things can be applied by using several methods namely zuhud, sincere, qana\\u2019ah and tawakal. The background of this research will explain the concept of happiness in the modern mysticism of Hamka. This research is a library research, and to make it more functional and useful, this paper will be equipped by a description method, interpretation and analysis of data in detail for each problem raised, therefore it can obtain a comprehensive understanding.\",\"published_in\":\"Refleksi: Jurnal Filsafat dan Pemikiran Islam; Vol 19, No 2 (2019); 205-220 ; 2548-4745 ; 1411-9951\",\"year\":\"2020-06-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"happiness; zuhud; Sufism; philosophy\",\"subject\":\"happiness; zuhud; Sufism; philosophy\",\"authors\":\"Arrasyid, Arrasyid\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/ushuluddin\\/ref\\/article\\/view\\/2261\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5c566bb38d4694f93c05b3b2eec5bc555d0c13e169a2dfc13c26f97c12b7e876\",\"relevance\":120},{\"id\":\"9fc6da7c9a336e2f87965410347060f68e6eac61053584a333bb806e9555c747\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/econjournals.com\\/index.php\\/irmm\\/article\\/view\\/9698; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2146-4405; 2146-4405; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/d044fe7acd634e959bb5a966deb151d4\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/d044fe7acd634e959bb5a966deb151d4\",\"title\":\"Measuring Employee Happiness in the UAE \\u2013 Integrating Organisational Data into the National Statistics\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Measuring happiness is a complicated process as the concept of happiness cannot be universally defined, collectively experienced or scientifically measured. Further, the lag between when happiness is experienced and when a happiness research report is produced makes intervention efforts ineffective and occasionally redundant. In the current literature, confusions exist in terms of definitions of happiness, well-being and whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an accurate measure of a nation\\u2019s development. Within the organisational context however, little research is carried out on happiness leading whilst at the practical level, some nations including the United Arab Emirates and Bhutan, are currently promoting several happiness initiatives in order to become a happier nation and, perhaps, influence the country\\u2019s productivity. We have proposed a simple data collection approach at the organisational level that will collect daily happiness data per each employee. The micro data collection process is different from the big data normally gathered by the state departments in the sense that it is timely, captures the individualized account of happiness which, we recommend, should be correlated with organisational productivity and fed into the overall national statistics on Gross National Product (GNP) and public well-being.

To enhance an individual???s happiness, we need to be aware of what situations and environmental conditions are conducive for happiness and explore the values of happiness we pursue. This study investigated the types of happiness expressed by Korean people using a mixed-method approach. Personal in-depth (n = 15) and focus group (n = 16) interviews were conducted with people who reported feeling a high level of happiness. Happiness categorization was conducted using Q methodology (n = 63). Subsequently, we surveyed 999 nationally representative samples of Korean adults to generalize the results of the Q analysis. The findings revealed seven types of adult happiness in Korea: (1) Self-actualization, (2) Belongingness, (3) Mission, (4) Social recognition, (5) Enjoyment, (6) Material success, and (7) Parenting. The combined results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that in Korea, people pursuing money or social success feel the unhappiest, whereas people pursuing a mission or sense of belonging feel the happiest. In conclusion, we discussed the need for happiness literacy education, to provide each adult an opportunity to understand the type of happiness they pursue.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-03\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Doh, Young Yim; Chung, Ji-Bum\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/scholarworks.unist.ac.kr\\/handle\\/201301\\/31512\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"71b6369740e6a7bd48506d5a46ce5e020fba2b05692ecfeda15133d1dc27fb31\",\"relevance\":118},{\"id\":\"df489c10e69a07a0efef5cb9ea255495700e088e89a37d228cd29b26822220db\",\"relation\":\"Philosophical Topics; 10.5840\\/philtopics20134114; 0276-2080; 2154-154X; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10161\\/20418\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10161\\/20418\",\"title\":\"On learning what happiness is\",\"paper_abstract\":\"I explore conceptions of happiness in classical Chinese philosophers Mengzi and Zhuangzi. In choosing to frame my question with the word 'happiness', I am guided by the desire to draw some comparative lessons for Western philosophy. 'Happiness' has been a central concept in Western ethics, and especially in Aristotelian and utilitarian ethics. The early Chinese concept most relevant to discussion of Mengzi and Zhuangzi concerns a specific form of happiness designated by the word le, which is best rendered as 'contentment'. For both Mengzi and Zhuangzi, there is a reflective dimension of happiness that consists in acceptance of the inevitable transformations of life and death, though these two thinkers chart very different paths to such acceptance. Mengzi holds that it lies in identification with a moral cause much larger than the self. Zhuangzi is profoundly skeptical about the viability of such a path to contentment. He instead offers identification with a world that transcends human good and evil, and a way to live in the present that can be deeply satisfying. One interesting outcome of both their discussions of achieving happiness is that both come to question the importance of happiness as a personal goal.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-04-13T01:29:27Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wong, David\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10161\\/20418\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"df489c10e69a07a0efef5cb9ea255495700e088e89a37d228cd29b26822220db\",\"relevance\":117},{\"id\":\"315c0d721b8d88b5c6e7cba317f9968dcca2184f3b80a8c54960cbe59324ccbe\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/nsuworks.nova.edu\\/tqr\\/vol25\\/iss3\\/8; https:\\/\\/nsuworks.nova.edu\\/cgi\\/viewcontent.cgi?article=3804&context=tqr\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/nsuworks.nova.edu\\/tqr\\/vol25\\/iss3\\/8; https:\\/\\/nsuworks.nova.edu\\/cgi\\/viewcontent.cgi?article=3804&context=tqr\",\"title\":\"The Enduring Role of the Family in the Happiness of Puerto Ricans\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The study of happiness has grown in popularity over the past decades emerging in psychology partly as a reaction against the emphasis on negative topics such as mental illness and other forms of dysfunction.

As part of well-being, the pursuit of happiness should be understood as a fundamental human goal for all nations and integrate the public policy objectives. The aim of this study is to find the variables explaining happiness in order to provide scientific knowledge to be addressed in public policies. Although the literature suggests that happiness is predicted by multiple factors, the proposed hypothesis suggests the existence of an overlapping model in the different databases, whose common factors stand out from a panoply of other factors as determinants of happiness. Data were collected from three international and reliable databases and a multivariate analysis was conducted. It was found absence of a significant association between happiness and other aspects of existence, considered as determinants of happiness, namely, religion, work and significant others. It was also found that satisfaction with life and health are the main contributors to happiness, considering that the material issues of existence also explain happiness, although in a less expressive way. These variables can be the key to happiness. Investing in health policies, guaranteeing access to adequate income and freeing people from material constraints, involving body and money, may allow people to focus on the higher needs of the Maslow pyramid, and this may eventually lead to greater happiness. ; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/publishedVersion\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"2030 Agenda; Happiness; Psychological well-being; Health status; Inequality\",\"subject\":\" Happiness; Psychological well-being; Health status; Inequality\",\"authors\":\"Leite, \\u00c2ngela; e Sousa, H\\u00e9lder Fernando Pedrosa; Vidal, Diogo Guedes; Dinis, Maria Alzira Pimenta\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10284\\/8814\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8d3f098ab1c86cd443b32c8a3b13a293d50edd63bd3a85490472388dff90cff4\",\"relevance\":113},{\"id\":\"b0002a336735c0d7c53a1ccc597c256ffa7b1a9d87516422894d2051014c346b\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S2352827319304227; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2352-8273; 2352-8273; doi:10.1016\\/j.ssmph.2020.100536; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c1bcd1656f8b4fc8837293fda4413a5c\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.ssmph.2020.100536; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c1bcd1656f8b4fc8837293fda4413a5c\",\"title\":\"Happiness is a warm gun?

In this paper, we assess the association between gun ownership and happiness. We use 27 years of national cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey (1973\\u20132018) and logistic regression to model self-rated happiness as a function of gun ownership (n = 37,960). In bivariate and partially adjusted models, we observed that the odds of being very happy were higher for respondents who reported having a gun in their home. This association persisted with adjustments for age, gender, race\\/ethnicity, education, employment status, household income, financial satisfaction, financial change, number of children, religious attendance, political affiliation, urban residence, region of interview, and survey year. In our fully adjusted model, gun ownership was unrelated to happiness. The original association between gun ownership and happiness was entirely confounded by marital status. In other words, gun owners only appeared happier because they are more likely to be married, which increases happiness. In the first study of gun ownership and happiness, we found that people who own guns and people who do not own guns tend to exhibit similar levels of happiness. This general pattern was consistent across nearly three decades of national surveys, a wide range of subgroups, and different measures of happiness. Our analyses are important because they contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology of happiness. They also indirectly challenge theoretical perspectives and cultural narratives about how guns contribute to feelings of safety, power, and pleasure.\",\"published_in\":\"SSM: Population Health, Vol 10, Iss , Pp - (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Guns; Happiness; Mental health; Well-being; Marriage; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270; Social sciences (General); H1-99\",\"subject\":\"Guns; Happiness; Mental health; Well-being; Marriage; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Terrence D.

In one recent study the association between suicide and happiness across communities in Hong Kong was largely explained by their close relationships with socioeconomic factors; likewise any association between national suicide rates and happiness could be due to shared socioeconomic influences on both these measures.

In addition, one in four scored above average in terms of mind-wandering and low in terms of happiness and positive effects. Finally, the mediating role played by affects was examined.

To enhance an individual\\u2019s happiness, we need to be aware of what situations and environmental conditions are conducive for happiness and explore the values of happiness we pursue. This study investigated the types of happiness expressed by Korean people using a mixed-method approach. Personal in-depth ( n = 15) and focus group ( n = 16) interviews were conducted with people who reported feeling a high level of happiness. Happiness categorization was conducted using Q methodology ( n = 63). Subsequently, we surveyed 999 nationally representative samples of Korean adults to generalize the results of the Q analysis. The findings revealed seven types of adult happiness in Korea: (1) Self-actualization, (2) Belongingness, (3) Mission, (4) Social recognition, (5) Enjoyment, (6) Material success, and (7) Parenting. The combined results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that in Korea, people pursuing money or social success feel the unhappiest, whereas people pursuing a mission or sense of belonging feel the happiest. In conclusion, we discussed the need for happiness literacy education, to provide each adult an opportunity to understand the type of happiness they pursue.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 5, p 1502 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"korean adult; types of happiness; subjectivity; q methodology; mixed-method approach; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"korean adult; types of happiness; subjectivity; q methodology; mixed-method approach; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Young Yim Doh; Ji-Bum Chung\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17051502\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"cbb2b235a1952a93d78953fd7a60a2b032b1f96464b7688c7af0cca17abb9aa7\",\"relevance\":99},{\"id\":\"d74056950124b79f41fd9b083264c321637523f57951563e51a86fecb001959e\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.euser.org\\/index.php\\/ejss\\/article\\/view\\/4675\\/4541; http:\\/\\/journals.euser.org\\/index.php\\/ejss\\/article\\/view\\/4675; doi:10.26417\\/ejss.v3i2.p19-31\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.euser.org\\/index.php\\/ejss\\/article\\/view\\/4675; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.26417\\/ejss.v3i2.p19-31\",\"title\":\"Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness: Presentation of the National Happiness and Positivity Programme - Qualitative Analysis\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Scientific research on the question of how happiness can be increased and then sustained has still a long way ahead. The authors have been developing studies in this field and have chosen the happiness initiatives of the Dubai and UAE government to elaborate a case study. This paper, extracted from the wider investigation, presents a study based on government communication on the creation of the Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness. In the scope of this work we have chosen the National Happiness and Positivity Programme of the Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness. Using the technique of content analysis, through the use of webQDA software, the aim was to understand how the government communicated its strategy for happiness and which are the most used concepts to capture the attention of institutions and citizens. Consequently, the aim was to understand what actions the government has advocated to implement the said programme. The results imply that the concept of positivity has a focus that is very close and complementary to that of happiness. It is also inferred that the government intends to promote 'happiness as a way of life\\u2019, and also to involve the private sector in the National Happiness and Positivity Programme. Finally, the author\\u2019s contribution to this research field is to demonstrate that this model of positivity and sustainable happiness can be extensively implemented, including in the academy.\",\"published_in\":\"European Journal of Social Sciences; Vol 3 No 2 (2020): May - August 2020; 19-31 ; 2601-8640 ; 2601-8632\",\"year\":\"2020-05-09\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Ribeiro, Diamantino; Costa, Ant\\u00f3nio Pedro; Remondes, Jorge\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.euser.org\\/index.php\\/ejss\\/article\\/view\\/4675\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"d74056950124b79f41fd9b083264c321637523f57951563e51a86fecb001959e\",\"relevance\":98},{\"id\":\"6066135012b38da81cdd7b0fd108c397aa22ce4f6063fa9599751348ff0dbb3e\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.sysislamicartjournal.ir\\/article_103891_951a59b5118be8c30c8702f07fba917d.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1735-708X; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2676-7759; 1735-708X; 2676-7759; doi:10.22034\\/ias.2020.103891; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c7653f4e1e0342fe9801f520ac66c951\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22034\\/ias.2020.103891; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c7653f4e1e0342fe9801f520ac66c951\",\"title\":\"Contentment in the Sonnets of Saadi and its Reflection in Iranian Painting\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Happiness, as an inner sensation, is featured in the verses of poets such as Saadi, who is one of the pioneers of the Persian sonnet. In his sonnets, Saadi points to features that create happiness and invites people towards serenity and contentment and far from sorrowfulness and grief. In Saadi's sonnets, the components of external and aphasic happiness as well as inner and infinitive happiness can be studied. The outer components of happiness, such as enjoying the beauties of nature and spring, pleasurable memories, being in the company of friends, songs, music and dance; also additionally, inner components of happiness comprising of goodness, justice, etc. Hence, the most imperative factor in regard to happiness is love. In this article, in addition to the external happiness factors mentioned, the main factor of the manifestation of joyfulness which is love will be discussed. Love is considered as the gem of Iranian painting in such a way that it is impossible to isolate the theme from the structure of the painting. This article relies on library studies and is based on a descriptive and content analysis method. Research questions: 1. To what extent is happiness reflected and manifested in Iranian paintings? 2. What effect has the concept of happiness had on the structure of the paintings? Research aims: 1. A study of the concept of happiness expressed in Saadi's sonnets manifested in Iranian painting. 2.

However measuring happiness has been elusive and until now has almost exclusively been done by asking survey questions about self-perceived happiness. We propose a novel approach, tracking happiness and stress through changes in body signals with a smartwatch, the \\u201cHappimeter\\u201d. It predicts individual emotions from sensor data collected by an Android Wear smartwatch, such as acceleration, heartbeat, and activity. The Happimeter was used over three months in the innovation lab of a bank with 22 employees to measure individual happiness, activity, and stress. The participants were randomly divided into an experimental and a control group of similar size. Both groups wore the watch and entered their subjective happiness, activity and stress levels several times a day. The user-entered ratings were then used to train a machine learning system using the sensors of the smartwatch to subsequently automatically predict happiness, activity, and stress. The experimental group received ongoing feedback about their mood and which activity, sensor signals, or other people, made them happier or unhappier, while the control group did not get any feedback about their predicted and manually entered emotions. Just like in quantum physics we observed a \\u201cHeisenberg Effect\\u201d, where the participants made aware of their measurements changed their behavior: Members of the experimental group that received happiness feedback were 16% happier, and 26% more active than the control group at the end of the experiment.

Instrument & Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 200 employees of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in 2019. Data were collected using GHQ-28 General Health, Oxford Happiness and Social Capital questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 software using independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression. Finding: The mean age of participants was 40.40\\u00b18.18 years. The happiness of 57.5% of the participants was moderate, 54.5% had poor mental health, and 60.5% reported high social capital. Happiness and mental health predicted social capital and explained 9.2% of its variance changes. A good place to live had significant relationship with happiness and high social capital (p<0.01), but did not have relationship with mental health (p= 0.294). Also the mean scores of social capital, mental health, and happiness showed significant relationship with self-assessment of individual health, self-assessment of happiness, and life satisfaction (p<0.05). Conclusions: The healthier and happier people feel and the more satisfied they are with life, the more they enjoy mental health, happiness, and social capital.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Education and Community Health, Vol 7, Iss 2, Pp 119-125 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"mental health; happiness; social capital; employees; Public aspects of medicine; RA1-1270\",\"subject\":\"mental health; happiness; social capital; employees; Public aspects of medicine; \",\"authors\":\"Babak Moeini; Forouzan Rezapur-Shahkolai; Leili Tapak; Azam Geravandi; Shahryar Parsamajd\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.29252\\/jech.7.2.119\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"143aa16cd8a945cefb253405b1cc2a95cb8ba6838c4f9f6efb53379510e751b5\",\"relevance\":93},{\"id\":\"b13bbf35a096b953a8d6e1bce3ed76521fa77c6c8e309c46a9828138834f16ea\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/ebcj.mums.ac.ir\\/article_15450_bcc90447a9ca699ac25f95d84df93b2e.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2008-2487; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2008-370X; 2008-2487; 2008-370X; doi:10.22038\\/ebcj.2020.44422.2205; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f789f51583b043b4bafc65b7dc602672\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22038\\/ebcj.2020.44422.2205; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f789f51583b043b4bafc65b7dc602672\",\"title\":\"Effects of Spiritual Interventions on Happiness Level of the Female Elderly Residing in Nursing Home\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: Spiritual health is one of the dimensions of health. Currently, studies have identified a link between happiness and spiritual health; however, the effects of spiritual interventions on happiness have not been evaluated among the elderly. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of spiritual interventionson the happiness of the female elderly. Method: A total of 40 subjects were randomly allocated to two intervention and control groups in Madar Nursing Home in Sabzevar, Iran, in 2019. In the intervention group, spiritual interventionswere performed as active listening, supporting religious rituals, using supportive systems, and arousing hope for 4 weeks. The happiness level of the participants was assessed before, immediately after, and a month after the intervention using the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed by SPSS software (version 21) using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The mean scores of happiness before the intervention were 45.6\\u00b11.2 and 36.5\\u00b111.9 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. However, the scores altered to 65.1\\u00b19.9 and 35.3\\u00b19.4 immediately after the intervention, as well as 64.7\\u00b19.7 and 35.1\\u00b18.9 a month following the intervention, in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the groups by determining the effect of the happiness score before the intervention (P<0.0001).

In this research, we employ the data collected in Chinese General Social Survey in 2013 and adopt the semiparametric estimation methodology of ordered probit model. Our main findings include the following. First, compared with the residents without higher education, residents with high education enjoy better health conditions, and residents' happiness also significantly affects their health conditions. Second, higher education may have a long-term impact on residents' health by affecting their happiness. Third, the results of grouping test demonstrate that, with the increase in age, the influence of residents' happiness on health is more pronounced, but the mechanism of higher education to improve health status by improving residents' happiness becomes unobvious. Furthermore, we adopt the Shapley value decomposition methodology to decompose the effects of various factors on residents' health.

Methods: The sample included 812 university students - 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) - who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study. Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness. Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness.

Log-linear models showed that some of the conceptualizations differed across both age groups and gender. Latent class analysis showed that happiness conceptualizations could be classified in five different groups.

More recently, several papers have looked beyond the traditional impact on economic growth and instead focused on the effects upon broader human welfare indicators. A separate empirical literature in recent decades has probed into the determinants of happiness and subjective well-being (using either country or household data). Our paper contributes to the literature by bringing these two empirical strands of research together. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that makes use of a large panel dataset to explore the links between changes in happiness across countries and several measures of resource wealth. Consistent with prior empirical evidence of a resource curse in oil-rich nations, we find that oil rents are negatively linked to improvements in happiness over time. This happiness \\u2018resource curse\\u2019 curse appears to be oil-specific and holds both for the levels as well as changes in happiness.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Ali, Sabna; Murshed, Syed Mansoob; Papyrakis, Elissaios\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/71374\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"587e1020e69462d22b12c7a89432f3e452697e52baa854cc15332d170e94e147\",\"relevance\":82},{\"id\":\"c3f1ed15dc5250a7644bd7b7c8519e7d0a3814e83df0c0b046f2d07b7eb3ca1f\",\"relation\":\"1863-6683; http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s11846-018-0301-4; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11536\\/154461; doi:10.1007\\/s11846-018-0301-4; REVIEW OF MANAGERIAL SCIENCE; WOS:000529687100005\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11536\\/154461; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s11846-018-0301-4\",\"title\":\"Modeling knowledge sharing and team performance in technology industry: the main and moderating effects of happiness\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study complements previous literature by bridging activity theory and the broaden-and-build theory to examine how happiness (as an intrinsic driver) and knowledge sharing (as an extrinsic driver) influence team performance.

The theoretical basis of the economy of happiness involves the study of economic and other factors that determine human happiness, its dependence on the level of economic development of the country and determine the parameters for assessing the level of happiness of society as a whole. The \\u00abEasterlin paradox\\u00bb is highlighted, which notes the limited impact of economic growth on the level of happiness of citizens. Theeconomy of happiness at the macro level is due to happiness at the micro level, in our study - at the University. Its purpose was to determine the level and measure the factors of happiness, and their impact, taking into account modern network communications on the productivity and creativity of students and teachers. The article presents the results of a study of 323 students and teachers of various higher education institutions of Ukraine, interviewed using a cloud questionary created using Google Form. The results of the study showed that most students and teachers are satisfied with life in higher education, believe that the factors of happiness are material, spiritual and social benefits together. It has been proven that young people are generally happier than older people rate, their level of happiness in terms of their role at the University at 4 (on a 5-point scale). It isshown that almost half of the respondents use their time irrationally on the Internet, but they are satisfied with it; most of the respondents would feel happier if they used their time as productively as possible and had the opportunity to spend more time on self-development and creativity. ; \\u041e\\u043f\\u0438\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u043e

measuring the economy of happiness. The theoretical basis of the economy of happiness involves the study of economic and other factors that determine human happiness, its dependence on the level of economic development of the country and determine the parameters for assessing the level of happiness of society as a whole. The \\u00abEasterlin paradox\\u00bb is highlighted, which notes the limited impact of economic growth on the level of happiness of citizens. Theeconomy of happiness at the macro level is due to happiness at the micro level, in our study - at the University. Its purpose was to determine the level and measure the factors of happiness, and their impact, taking into account modern network communications on the productivity and creativity of students and teachers. The article presents the results of a study of 323 students and teachers of various higher education institutions of Ukraine, interviewed using a cloud questionary created using Google Form. The results of the study showed that most students and teachers are satisfied with life in higher education, believe that the factors of happiness are material, spiritual and social benefits together. It has been proven that young people are generally happier than older people rate, their level of happiness in terms of their role at the University at 4 (on a 5-point scale). It isshown that almost half of the respondents use their time irrationally on the Internet, but they are satisfied with it; most of the respondents would feel happier if they used their time as productively as possible and had the opportunity to spend more time on self-development and creativity. ; \\u041e\\u043f\\u0438\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u043e

From a person-activity congruence perspective, we proposed that an individual\\u2019s eudaimonic orientation moderates the effect of prosocial behavior on happiness, whereas hedonic orientation does not.

Participants\\u2019 eudaimonic and hedonic orientations were assessed before the game, and their post-task happiness were measured after the game. The results showed that participants in the benevolence condition reported higher post-task positive affect than those in the control condition. Furthermore, this happiness effect was moderated by participants\\u2019 eudaimonic orientation\\u2014participants with high eudaimonic orientation reaped greater benefits from benevolence, and their hedonic orientation did not moderate the relationship between benevolence and happiness.

The objective ofthis article is to examine whether sleep adequacy contributes to the explanation of variation inhappiness index levels across countries. Analysis was undertaken using ordinary least squaresregression method. The dependent variable is the self-reported happiness index developed by theGallup poll and published in the World Happiness Report. Two alternative model specificationswere used. The first included average sleep minutes per country, GDP per capita(purchasingpower parity), unemployment rate, and environmental performance index. The second modelspecification included average sleep minutes per country, GDP (purchasing power parity), andeconomic freedom index. Both model specifications met several robustness checks, and showedoverall significance and significant coefficients. Results showed that an increase in average sleepduration by 10 minutes is associated with an improvement in the happiness score by 0.1 and 0.15points in the first and second model specifications respectively, noting an average happiness scoreof 6.2 in the country sample. The conclusion that sleep duration contributes to explaining variationin happiness levels across countries is a call for policy makers to consider policies targetingimprovement in sleep adequacy as priority, and to direct more resources to further research inthe area of sleep economics. Previous studies in the area of happiness economics did not considersleep in explaining differences in happiness among countries, and previous studies in the area ofeconomics of sleep did not consider the happiness index at a global level.\",\"published_in\":\"ECONOMICS - \\u010cASOPIS ZA INOVACIJSKA I EKONOMSKA ISTRA\\u017dIVANJA; \\u0421\\u0432\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430 7, \\u0411\\u0440. 2 (2019): ECONOMICS ; 2303-5013 ; 2303-5005\",\"year\":\"2020-06-03\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Mohamed Kamal, Azza\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/doisrpska.nub.rs\\/index.php\\/OIK\\/article\\/view\\/6683\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"711b762dffd24660c4dfcc5b615d819858bd7fec8db334c81d5ca7a45a1e9cb5\",\"relevance\":74},{\"id\":\"a30161a76eaf36e8aad4068acf8f73781607f46e89acd2ef8d4bd8dff79ec44b\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01931\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1664-1078; 1664-1078; doi:10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01931; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c6aebae02f194c1c98fd6206bb2d3666\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01931; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c6aebae02f194c1c98fd6206bb2d3666\",\"title\":\"Authentic Happiness at Work: Self- and Peer-Rated Orientations to Happiness, Work Satisfaction, and Stress Coping\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The authentic happiness theory covers three basic orientations to happiness; namely, the life of pleasure (via hedonism); engagement (via flow-related experiences); and meaning (via eudaimonia). There is broad evidence for a positive relationship between these three orientations and indicators of positive psychological functioning in a variety of life domains. However, their contribution to well-being at work is understudied. The main aim of this study was testing the relationship between self- and peer-rated orientations to happiness, work related well-being (work satisfaction, work stress), and coping strategies. Further possible mediating effects of the coping strategies on the relationship between orientations to happiness and well-being at work were also examined. The sample consisted of 372 German-speaking Swiss adults (60.3% female), aged between 18 and 65 years (M = 38.9, SD = 10.8) with a minimum of 40% full-time employment. For 100 persons, peer-ratings of the orientations to happiness were available. Our results showed that the life of engagement and, to a lesser extent, the life of meaning are related to work satisfaction. The life of pleasure was associated with lower levels of reported work stress. Further, positive associations between self- and peer-rated orientations to happiness (particularly pleasure) and adaptive coping strategies with stress were also found. Mediation analyses showed that the effects of engagement in general and content-related work satisfaction were mediated mainly by control and negative coping, while the association between meaning and resigned work satisfaction was mediated by positive coping. Negative coping fully mediated the association between the pleasurable life and work stress. Overall, our results indicate that employees\\u2019 orientations to happiness are of importance for experiencing well-being at work.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"coping; orientations to happiness; positive psychology; work satisfaction; work stress; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"coping; orientations to happiness; positive psychology; work satisfaction; work stress; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Nancy Tandler; Annette Krauss; Ren\\u00e9 T.

Studies showed that happiness has several dimensions and that these are dependent, amongst others, of cultural, economic, and social factors. The aim of this study was to validate a measure that identifies possible dimensions of happiness having as a starting point the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. An online questionnaire with socio-professional items and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was used. A sample of 1032 individuals from several Portuguese higher education establishments was collected, of which 581 (56.3%) were students, 257 (24.9%) were faculty members, and 194 (18.8%) were non-teaching staff. The sample was divided into two subsamples: sample 1 (n=508) and sample 2 (n=524). A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed on sample 1, followed by Covariance Based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM) on sample 2. The PCA presented results, consistent with the existing theory, for a three-factor model. CB-SEM identified several items with significant correlations with more than one latent variable, which eliminated from the model. A valid model (CFI= .95; TLI= .94; AGFI= .95; RMSEA= .04) was obtained, with three dimensions: Joy (six items); Positivism (nine items); and Reliability (two items). We conclude that a threedimension model is valid for the population under study and should be applied to other populations to deepen the conclusions.

The research method used was literature study and content analysis as the data analysis technique. The results of this study indicate that first, happiness in the Koran was not caused by wealth but our faith as a believer. Second, there are endorphins in humans that emit happiness and calmness. Third, someone who is happy will have a change in thoughts, words, actions, facial expressions, and positive muscle activity. Fourth, the learning model that can create happy learning begins with creating happy emotions, giving both material and non-material rewards, and good habituation.

The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study.Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness.Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness.

The HPI indicator is very important for a country to increase the happiness of its people. Example: life expectancy in a country will increase and unemployment will decrease because a person has extensive knowledge and knowledge that is needed both by himself and the company that will accept him as his employee.

We hypothesized that people will feel happier when the activities they are performing are aligned with their goals. The study also explored the roles of goal progress and competence in this relation. Data on goal-activity alignment, goal progress, competence, and state happiness were collected in an experience-sampling study with undergraduate students (N = 159) and a survey study with Amazon MTurk workers (N = 252). Using multilevel analyses and regression analyses, results indicated that participants were happier when they were pursuing activities that were more closely aligned with their goals than when pursuing less goal-aligned activities; the results remained significant after accounting for goal progress. Participants who were more goal aligned on average reported greater state happiness; this effect was nonsignificant when goal progress was accounted for. Results suggest that goal alignment has a significant and unique effect on state happiness and that goal pursuit has very immediate benefits that begin as soon as individuals start doing actions helpful for their personal goals.\",\"published_in\":\"Motivation Science vol. 6 no. 2, pp. 156-163\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Experience sampling; Goal alignment; State happiness\",\"subject\":\"Experience sampling; Goal alignment; State happiness\",\"authors\":\"Wang, J.F.

It has been seen a significant difference in happiness scores in terms of other variables of branch, the thought of professional respectability, enjoying the occupation and the situation of reading book. It has been found that school counsellors have a higher happiness score than branch teachers have, teachers who like their occupations have a higher happiness score than they who do not like their occupations have, teachers who find teaching as a respectable occupation have a higher happiness score than they who do not find teaching as a respectable occupation have. On the other hand, it has been determined that the increase in the number of reading book is effective on happiness. When the relation between optimism and happiness has been investigated, it has been found that there are at a level of .64 relation besides, optimism predicts happiness about 41 percent.

In the nationally representative \\u201c2017 Sierra Leone Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)\\u201d, 18006 adolescent and adult women (15-49 years old) responded to questions on life satisfaction, happiness, optimism and social variables. Linear and logistic regression was used to investigate the associations with life satisfaction, happiness and optimism. Life satisfaction was a mean of 5.6 (range 0-10), the prevalence of being very happy was 35.4% and 93.2% thought their life would be netter in one year\\u2019s time (optimism). In adjusted linear or logistic regression analyses, having primary or more education, higher wealth status, access to media (owing a mobile phone) and not having a functional difficulty (or disability) were associated with higher life satisfaction, happiness and optimism. Belonging to an \\u201cother ethnic group\\u201d was positively and currently tobacco use and FGM were negatively associated with both life satisfaction and happiness. Compared to women who had married or entered a union before they were 18 years old, women who got married when they were 18 years and older had a higher life satisfaction and optimism. The study found that majority of Sierra Leonean adolescents and adult women reported being satisfied with their lives, were happy and optimistic. Several factors associated with life satisfaction, happiness and optimism were identified, which may help in developing interventions.Keywords: Life satisfaction, happiness, optimism, adolescents, women, Sierra Leone\",\"published_in\":\"Gender and Behaviour; Vol 17, No 4 (2019); 14562\\u201314570 ; 1596-9231\",\"year\":\"2020-02-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"Life satisfaction; happiness; optimism; adolescents; women; Sierra Leone\",\"subject\":\"Life satisfaction; happiness; optimism; adolescents; women; Sierra Leone\",\"authors\":\"Pengpid, Supa; Peltzer, Karl\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ajol.info\\/index.php\\/gab\\/article\\/view\\/193518\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"0d060fb59beb29b92337668b0ec58b00c185a5cff49b01c427e45a774a8010bb\",\"relevance\":58},{\"id\":\"c3a1bf18d8dd58aff1c7b841589b1799faf36255cd2788bc32543bd0f13c9e0b\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.infad.eu\\/RevistaINFAD\\/OJS\\/index.php\\/IJODAEP\\/article\\/view\\/1859; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/0214-9877; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2603-5987; 0214-9877; 2603-5987; doi:10.17060\\/ijodaep.2020.n1.v2.1859; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/23b12354f34c477ba11ec1c5cf630fb4\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17060\\/ijodaep.2020.n1.v2.1859; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/23b12354f34c477ba11ec1c5cf630fb4\",\"title\":\"Can human beings achieve happiness?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The human being moves the pieces of his own life to achieve his happiness. In the work, the very possibility of achieving happiness is radically questioned, starting from a kind ofagnosiaabout itsconception asafinalstage.

It draws attention to the two-sided aspect of happiness, physical, on the one hand, and spiritual on the other. It is concluded that it is very difficult for us to achieve the maximum and permanent degree of happiness or complete happiness. We may assume the weight and responsibility of achieving maximum happiness but, like Sisyphus, carrying the gigantic stone to the top of the mountain over and over again, we can never stay there, in that ideal or emotional territory that we know little about and that is shaped like an asymptote. With regard to the possibility of being happier to a greater or lesser extent, the proposal of Abraham Maslow\\u2019s gradual pyramid is suggestive. The conclusion is optimistic, understanding that relative happiness encompasses a very variable range and is not an end point.

Studies of the impact of happiness and life satisfaction on life expectancy and mortality in the US are limited or non-existent. Using a national longitudinal dataset, we examined the association between levels of happiness\\/life satisfaction and US life expectancy and all-cause mortality. Methods: We analyzed the 2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) prospectively linked to 2001-2014 mortality records in the National Death Index (NDI) (N=30,377). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model survival time as a function of happiness, life satisfaction, and sociodemographic and behavioral covariates. Results: Life expectancies at age 18 among adults with high levels of happiness and life satisfaction were, respectively, 7.5 and 8.9 years higher compared to those with low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. In Cox models with 14 years of mortality follow-up, all-cause mortality risk was 82% higher (hazard ratio [HR]=1.82; 95% CI=1.59,2.08) in adults with little or no happiness, controlling for age, and 36% higher (HR=1.36; 95% CI=1.17,1.57) in adults with little\\/no happiness, controlling for sociodemographic, behavioral and health characteristics, when compared with adults reporting happiness all of the time. Mortality risk was 107% higher (HR=2.07; 95% CI=1.80,2.38) in adults who were very dissatisfied with their life, controlling for age, and 39% higher (HR=1.39; 95% CI=1.20,1.60) in adults who were very dissatisfied, controlling for all covariates, when compared with adults who were very satisfied. Conclusions and Global Health Implications: Adults with higher happiness and life satisfaction levels had significantly higher life expectancy and lower all-cause mortality risks than those with lower happiness and satisfaction levels. These findings underscore the significance of addressing subjective well-being in the population as a strategy for reducing all-cause mortality.

Furthermore, the paper explores whether diversity management perceptions mediates the relationship between workplace happiness and organisational citizenship behaviour. Design\\/Methodology\\/Approach: A total of 260 questionnaire from a number of public hospitals in Egypt were analysed using both t-test and Structural Equation Modelling. Findings\\/ Results: We found that female physicians perceive diversity management policies\\/protocols more positively than their male colleagues. Moreover, gender has no or little effect on physicians\\u2019 perceptions of workplace happiness. We also found that workplace happiness positively affects physicians\\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour, and finally, diversity management practices can mediate the relationship between workplace happiness and physicians\\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour. Social and practical implications: We believe that managers can raise the feeling of workplace happiness among their staff if they maintain some personal relationships with physicians, care about the physicians\\u2019 work\\/life balance, promote after work gatherings, initiate coffee time talks, encourage open communication practices and more. Originality: The paper is based on the argument that although employees might be happy in the workplace through (engagement, job satisfaction, affective commitment), however their happiness will be unlikely reflected into a positive organizational citizenship behaviour towards their organisation, except (social exchange theory) they feel or perceive (equity theory) the overall practices of diversity management in that organization positively.

The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness.

A total of 2345 healthy adults were recruited. Demographic characteristic, physical activity, life satisfaction, and happiness were collected. Participants were divided into young, middle-aged, and older adult groups based on age, and physical activity was categorized as high, moderate, and low. After controlling for demographic characteristics, participants with high and moderate activity levels had significantly higher life satisfaction and happiness than those with a low activity level across the total population and the three age groups. Age squared was a significant predictor of a positive curvilinear between age and life satisfaction and happiness. Physical activity was significantly related to life satisfaction and happiness in young, middle-aged, and older adults. In addition, life satisfaction and happiness increased with increasing age.

A brief review of previous studies on OHI showed the lack of evaluation of OHI fairness\\/equivalence in measuring happiness among identified groups. Methods: To examine the psychometric properties and measurement invariance of the OHI, responses of 500 university students were analyzed using item response theory and ordinal logistic regression (OLR). Relevant measures of effect size were utilized to interpret the results. Differential test functioning was also evaluated to determine whether there is an overall bias at the test level. Results: OLR analysis detected four items across gender and two items across marital status to function differentially. An assessment of effect sizes implied negligible differences for practical considerations. Conclusions: This study was a significant step towards providing theoretical and practical information regarding the assessment of happiness by presenting adequate evidence regarding the psychometric properties of OHI.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-06-21\",\"subject_orig\":\"WM Psychiatry\",\"subject\":\"WM Psychiatry\",\"authors\":\"Mousavi, Amin; Sharafi, Zahra; Mahmoudi, Abdolreza; Raeisi Shahraki, Hadi\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.skums.ac.ir\\/8632\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"da729e7d07a11975969546a3966141914452f56d4c27367fc3b66cca1d655fd8\",\"relevance\":39},{\"id\":\"10cf6bc4587c4d2b20b0de9f2e949b65ab44f2b2548b9aa512e3d4a5250ca462\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01398\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1664-1078; 1664-1078; doi:10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01398; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6c8df850f41b4ae888a3281dedc9b079\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01398; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6c8df850f41b4ae888a3281dedc9b079\",\"title\":\"Happy Little Benefactor: Prosocial Behaviors Promote Happiness in Young Children From Two Cultures\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Evidence that young children display more happiness when sharing than receiving treats supports that humans, by nature, are prosocial.

The Physical Component Summary of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2) and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale were used to test the validity of the self-rated health item. The Mental Component of that 12-item scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were validators regarding the self-rated happiness item. Criterion validity was tested using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2).Results: The correlations between the self-rated health and happiness measures and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2) validators were positive and statistically significant, supporting convergent validity. Sufficient divergent validity was demonstrated through the negative and significant relationship between the self-rated health item and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale scores and the negative and significant relationship between the self-rated happiness item and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Optimal cut-off scores for physical and mental health states depended on age and gender.Conclusion: The global self-rated health and happiness measures were validated.

The measurement of value is WVS (World Value Survey) and it consists of the emotion of happiness, active\\/ inactive membership of a church or religious organization, important in life; religion, confidence on charitable\\/ humanitarian organization and active\\/ inactive membership of charitable\\/ humanitarian organization. Institutions are measured by WGI (World Governance Indicators) and it consists of corruption, regulatory quality, accountability and voice, rule of law, political stability and government effectiveness, the sub-variables of happiness (index) are social support, freedom to take decisions and generosity and world\\u2019s philanthropy is measured by CAF (Charitable Aid Foundation) world giving index. We have gathered panel data (from the period 2010 to 2014) of CAF index, happiness index and WGI of 62 countries and cross-sectional data of CAF index, Hofstede index, WGI, happiness index and WVS of 24 countries. The result (of panel data) shows that there is a significant relation of WGI, social support and freedom of choice with CAF index whereas there is an insignificant connection between generosity and CAF index. The findings (of cross-sectional data of all factors combined) shows that there is a relation of the Hofstede index and happiness index with the CAF index while there is no linkage of WGI and WVS with the CAF index. The study suggests that charitable organizations should personify their value in order to build trust among the public. Countries should improve their governance because this will lead to equality and by doing this countries will also manage their resources efficiently and effectively.

Methods We conducted a randomized, single-blind, actively-controlled, parallel group study in seven municipalities in the Netherlands. To be eligible, participants had to experience loneliness, health problems and low socio-economic status. Each group received several home visits by a counsellor (two in the control condition, two to six in the experimental condition). In the Happiness Route, a happiness-based approach was used, whereas the control condition used a traditional problem-based approach. The primary outcome was well-being, measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Results Fifty-eight participants were randomized to the Happiness Route, 50 to the control condition. Participants were severely lonely, had on average three health problems and less than 5% had paid work. The total MHC-SF score, emotional and social well-being, depression and loneliness improved significantly over the nine-month period in both conditions (p < .05), but there were no significant changes between the conditions across time. Languishing decreased significantly from 33% at baseline to 16% at follow-up among the Happiness Route participants but did not change significantly in the control condition. No significant improvement over time was found in psychological well-being, resilience, purpose in life, health-related quality of life and social participation. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that expected saved costs per QALY lost was \\u20ac219,948 for the Happiness Route, relative to the control condition. The probability was 83% that the Happiness Route was cost saving and 54% that the Happiness Route was cost-effective at a willingness to accept a threshold of \\u20ac100,000. Conclusions Mental health status of both groups improved considerably. However, we could not demonstrate that the Happiness Route yielded better health outcomes compared to the control condition. Nevertheless, the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the Happiness Route is an acceptable intervention from a health-economic point of view. Our results should be viewed in light of the fact that we could not include the planned number of participants. Trial registration Netherlands Trial Register: NTR3377 .

The purpose of the current study is to develop a scale in order to assess the potential for happiness of individuals related to the situation they have identified. The Happiness for Potential Scale is a Likert-type scale consisting of 11 items. The scale has three factors: expectation, knowledge and pleasure. To conduct the validity and reliability study of the scale, the data were collected from 306 participants. The analyses were conducted with 278 participants (63% females and 36% males) after missing observations and outliers were excluded from the data set. The participants&#039; mean age was 31.97, SD = 10.28. The results showed that the items were accumulated under three factors and explained 64.86% of the variance in The Potential for Happiness Scale. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha coefficient was calculated as .65 for expectation factor (3 items), .64 for knowledge factor (3 items) and .88 for pleasure (expression) factor and .86 for the total scale. Based on the findings from the analyses, it could be concluded that the scale which was developed in order to determine the potential for happiness of individuals is a valid and reliable measurement tool. ; Bu ara\\u015ft\\u0131rman\\u0131n konusunu olu\\u015fturan \\u201cmutluluk potansiyeli\\u201d, mutluluk d\\u00fczeyinin de\\u011fi\\u015fkenli\\u011fine (durumluk mutluluk) odakl\\u0131 olan ve mutluluk yaratma ihtimali ile ilgilenen g\\u00f6r\\u00fc\\u015fe dayan\\u0131r ve ki\\u015finin i\\u00e7inde bulundu\\u011fu durumdan doyum sa\\u011flamas\\u0131n\\u0131, sevin\\u00e7 duymas\\u0131n\\u0131 ifade eder.

Moreover, this study explores the different effects of conversion among the groups divided by the characteristics of migrant workers. The results show that from an overall perspective, although the conversion of household registration could improve the happiness of migrant workers, the degree of this improvement is minor. Further, the characteristics of the different groups, including age, educational background, contracted land, collective dividends, and income significantly affect the improvement of happiness. The conversion of household registration has obviously improved the happiness of migrant workers with low educational backgrounds, low income, and contracted land. Based on these findings, the government should take more targeted actions to improve the positive effects of household registration among different migrant worker groups due to the different characteristics in the process of household registration system reform.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 2661, p 2661 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"household registration; migrant worker; happiness; group difference analysis; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"household registration; migrant worker; happiness; group difference analysis; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Xin-hao Liu; Li-min Han; Bin Yuan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17082661\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"1ff8e9a23f44900db2b404b28e791f6940956cf07c8e4d42e93f4acea1df33d5\",\"relevance\":19},{\"id\":\"78f11bf4253160e698cb0003e30669e19d1ccb888f4d6a66dfcd66c9461c7d9c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.maranatha.edu\\/index.php\\/humanitas\\/article\\/view\\/2397\\/1550; https:\\/\\/journal.maranatha.edu\\/index.php\\/humanitas\\/article\\/view\\/2397; doi:10.28932\\/humanitas.v4i1.2397\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.maranatha.edu\\/index.php\\/humanitas\\/article\\/view\\/2397; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.28932\\/humanitas.v4i1.2397\",\"title\":\"Potret Kebahagiaan Relawan Studi Kasus Relawan Satya Wacana Peduli di Lombok\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The main purpose of all activities carried out by humans is to obtain happiness.

Up until now, Human Development Index (HDI) is considered to be sufficiently representing the measure of human well-being. However, Easterlin (1974) argues that higher welfare does not always imply to higher happiness. Blanchflower and Oswald (2005) prove the statement of Easterlin (1974) by demonstrating the paradox between HDI level and happiness in Australia. Further, the measure of HDI is said to be less representative in reflecting happiness as it has not yet incorporated the element of religiosity. Thus, several of the new composite measures of well-being in Muslim countries have been proposed, one of them is Sharia Maqasid Index constructed by Ali and Hasan (2014). This research attempts to make comparison between HDI and Sharia Maqasid Index and to decide which of the two indices gives the best measure of human happiness. The authors employ Ordered Logit method and use data taken from World Value Survey along the period of 1999-2009 to measure happiness as in Leigh and Wolfers (2006), as well as to measure Sharia Maqasid Index as in Ali and Hasan (2014).

Structural equation model (SEM) using AMOS was implemented to obtain the best-fit model and to determine the role of job crafting as a potential mediator between empowering leadership and happiness at work. The results indicated no direct statistical effect for empowering leadership on happiness at work with an estimated value of 0.17 and a standard error of 0.073. The results also show that there was a significant statistical effect for empowering leadership on crafting and this effect was high with a value of 0.479 and a standard error of 0.040. Finally, the results revealed a direct effect for empowering leadership on happiness at work through the mediating role of job crafting. The study recommended that it is necessary for universities to offer new programs and workshops that improve the behaviors of empowering leadership in light of work conditions at various levels and to motivate job crafting to increase levels of happiness at work.\",\"published_in\":\"Business: Theory and Practice, Vol 21, Iss 1 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"empowering leadership; job crafting; task crafting; relationship crafting; happiness at work; Business; HF5001-6182\",\"subject\":\"empowering leadership; job crafting; task crafting; relationship crafting; happiness at work; Business; \",\"authors\":\"Mohammed Yasin Ghadi; Khaled Salameh Almanaga'h\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3846\\/btp.2020.11109\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"cbc80ebbfb98318836908ff130c330a2703ef6f23492f9d7ceec3b0336fc8645\",\"relevance\":16},{\"id\":\"76afd847c4bb2c4cfdf23413ab05900bfd224d9360ade463c6e23a6e3174cea0\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/1073756; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/inuefd\\/issue\\/53939\\/389635; doi:10.17679\\/inuefd.389635\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/inuefd\\/issue\\/53939\\/389635; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17679\\/inuefd.389635\",\"title\":\"Okul \\u00d6ncesi D\\u00f6nemde Mutlulu\\u011fa \\u0130li\\u015fkin Betimlemeler ; Descriptions About the Concept of Happiness In Pre-School Period\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Bu \\u00e7al\\u0131\\u015fman\\u0131n amac\\u0131; okul \\u00f6ncesi d\\u00f6nemdeki 5 ya\\u015f grubu \\u00e7ocuklar\\u0131n mutluluk kavram\\u0131n\\u0131 nas\\u0131l betimlediklerini incelemektir.

Previous research on adults suggests, in an isolated manner, the relationship between connectedness to nature, the development of behaviors in favor of the environment, and positive results derived from them, such as happiness and well-being. In the present research, connectedness to nature was considered as a determinant of sustainable behaviors, and happiness was considered as a positive consequence of the latter. This research aimed to demonstrate the relationship between these variables in children. Two hundred and ninety-six children with an average age of 10.42 years old participated in the study, in which they responded to a research instrument that measured connectedness to nature, sustainable behaviors (pro-ecological behavior, frugality, altruism, and equity), and happiness. To analyze the relationships between these variables, a model of structural equations was specified and tested. The results revealed a significant relationship between connectedness to nature and sustainable behaviors, which, in turn, impact happiness. This suggests that children who perceive themselves as more connected to nature tend to perform more sustainable behaviors; also, the more pro-ecological, frugal, altruistic, and equitable the children are, the greater their perceived happiness will be.

The research instruments included Haddad et al. psychological hardiness questionnaire, oxford happiness questionnaire and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire.The collected data were analyzed by SPSS software version 22 using Pearson correlation and regression analysis. The results suggested correlation coefficients of 0.44, 0.47 and 0.38 between the components of psychological hardiness (control, commitment and challenge) and sleep quality, respectively. Also, there was a correlation of 0.56 between happiness and sleep quality (P<0.001). Therefore, it can be said that psychological hardiness and happiness can predict of the quality of sleep in the elderly.

In such an encounter, consumers anticipate the emotions they might experience as a result of their decision, as they cannot realistically evaluate product performances. The work investigates the nature and the influence of these future-oriented emotions, namely anticipated and anticipatory happiness, in the first encounter with new products. Through a first laboratory study, adopting both physiological (micro-facial expressions analysis) and self-reported measures, we confirm the distinction between anticipated and anticipatory happiness. We further show the differential impact of these two emotional constructs on the consumer decision-making process by grounding on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Through a second study, based on a questionnaire, we further investigate the role of anticipated happiness within the TPB. We show that anticipated happiness is a pervasive emotional construct that influences all stages of the intention formation process. We discuss how these findings enrich existing knowledge on the interplay between cognitive and affective components of the decision-making process for new products. Moreover, we offer a methodological contribution to the use of physiological methods to assess emotions.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"anticipated happiness; anticipatory happiness; Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB); micro-facial expressions; decision-making process; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"anticipated happiness; anticipatory happiness; Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB); micro-facial expressions; decision-making process; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Debora Bettiga; Lucio Lamberti\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00929\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ddf499616d6f1f17529571d9676b16f3e1e39574e97ecf9d06d9b170c74c614b\",\"relevance\":9},{\"id\":\"7d5e32e71c794dea7047d329a6086091d6106696604f13cf14a4feadf1263dfc\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/jurnal.unimed.ac.id\\/2012\\/index.php\\/jupiis\\/article\\/view\\/17581\\/13245; 10.24114\\/jupiis.v12i1.17581.g13245; https:\\/\\/jurnal.unimed.ac.id\\/2012\\/index.php\\/jupiis\\/article\\/view\\/17581; doi:10.24114\\/jupiis.v12i1.17581\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/jurnal.unimed.ac.id\\/2012\\/index.php\\/jupiis\\/article\\/view\\/17581; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24114\\/jupiis.v12i1.17581\",\"title\":\"Dukungan Sosial, Optimisme dan Kebahagiaan pada Mustahiq\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Happiness is a hope in the lives of many people, including the Mustahiq.

This study aimed to identify the psychological happiness and its relation to the level of ambition among the students of the University of Jordan expected to graduate. The study sample consisted of (446) students, they were randomized from the students who were expected to be graduated. The researcher used the Oxford Scale of Psychological Happiness and developed a level of ambition scale. The coefficients of honesty and consistency were extracted and were accepted. The results of the study indicated that the students expected to graduate have an average level of psychological happiness, it also indicated that the students expected to graduate have a low level of ambition, further more the results showed a positive correlation between the level of ambition and psychological happiness, in addition the results indicated that there are differences of statistical significance at The level of significance (0.05 = \\u03b1), the psychological happiness and the level of ambition depending on gender for the benefit of females.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0645\\u062c\\u0644\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u062c\\u0627\\u0645\\u0639\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0625\\u0633\\u0644\\u0627\\u0645\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0644\\u0644\\u062f\\u0631\\u0627\\u0633\\u0627\\u062a \\u0627\\u0644\\u062a\\u0631\\u0628\\u0648\\u064a\\u0629 \\u0648\\u0627\\u0644\\u0646\\u0641\\u0633\\u064a\\u0629; \\u0645\\u062c\\u0644\\u062f 28, \\u0639\\u062f\\u062f 2 (2020) ; IUG Journal of Educational and Psychological Sciences; \\u0645\\u062c\\u0644\\u062f 28, \\u0639\\u062f\\u062f 2 (2020) ; 2410-3152 ; 2410-2946\",\"year\":\"2020-03-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u0627\\u0644\\u0633\\u0639\\u0627\\u062f\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0646\\u0641\\u0633\\u064a\\u0629\\u060c \\u0627\\u0644\\u0637\\u0645\\u0648\\u062d\\u060c \\u0627\\u0644\\u062c\\u0627\\u0645\\u0639\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0623\\u0631\\u062f\\u0646\\u064a\\u0629; Psychological happiness; Ambition; Students of the University of Jordan\",\"subject\":\"\\u0627\\u0644\\u0633\\u0639\\u0627\\u062f\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0646\\u0641\\u0633\\u064a\\u0629\\u060c \\u0627\\u0644\\u0637\\u0645\\u0648\\u062d\\u060c \\u0627\\u0644\\u062c\\u0627\\u0645\\u0639\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0623\\u0631\\u062f\\u0646\\u064a\\u0629; Psychological happiness; Ambition; Students of the University of Jordan\",\"authors\":\"\\u0627\\u0644\\u0632\\u0628\\u0646, \\u0645\\u0645\\u062f\\u0648\\u062d \\u0628\\u0646\\u064a\\u0647\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/journal.iugaza.edu.ps\\/index.php\\/IUGJEPS\\/article\\/view\\/5639\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"25e403e28b94286574ae9e20941f977ef3aa19d4afda62c83d358b3eac7d7842\",\"relevance\":7},{\"id\":\"94dc1fd42f7b07bb82cad9e4bde207804ab35682a9cc34b8ba87bdcac04dce7e\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.asianonlinejournals.com\\/index.php\\/EDU\\/article\\/view\\/1964\\/1584; http:\\/\\/www.asianonlinejournals.com\\/index.php\\/EDU\\/article\\/view\\/1964; doi:10.20448\\/journal.522.2020.63.493.498\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/www.asianonlinejournals.com\\/index.php\\/EDU\\/article\\/view\\/1964; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.20448\\/journal.522.2020.63.493.498\",\"title\":\"Examination of Goal Commitment and Subjective Happiness Levels of the Students Studying at the Faculty of Sport Sciences According to Gender, Active Sport Participation and Sports Type Variables\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study was carried out to examine the goal commitment and subjective happiness levels of students studying in the faculty of sport sciences according to some variables.

A total of 154 Spanish male and female (50%) older adults (65\\u201396 years old, M = 77.44, SD = 8.03; 64% noninstitutionalized elderly) voluntarily participated in this correlational, cross-sectional study. The participants completed self-reports on their perceived health status, self-efficacy, social support, optimism, and global subjective well-being (SWB) as well as its dimensions. Path analysis was used to examine direct and indirect relationships. The final model had an excellent fit with the data (\\u03c72(10) = 11.837, p = .296, \\u03c72\\/df = 1.184; SRMR = 0.050, CFI = 0.994, RMSEA = 0.035), revealing the unique causal effects of all the included predictors on happiness. With the exception of self-efficacy, the psychosocial resources predicted older adults\\u2019 current happiness, and this relationship was fully mediated by hedonic balance and life satisfaction, which were found to be putative intermediary factors for SWB. Self-efficacy in turn predicted the remaining psychosocial resources. Our findings extend the existing evidence on the influences of health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, optimism, and social support on SWB. Furthermore, they support the proposal of hedonic balance and life satisfaction as dimensions of SWB, thus supporting the tripartite hierarchical model of happiness. These results may inform future interventions seeking to improve happiness in late adulthood.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 5684, p 5684 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"happiness; subjective well-being; psychosocial resources; older adults; path analysis; Medicine; R\",\"subject\":\"happiness; subjective well-being; psychosocial resources; older adults; path analysis; Medicine; R\",\"authors\":\"Raquel Lara; M\\u1d43 Luisa V\\u00e1zquez; Adelaida Ogallar; D\\u00e9bora Godoy-Izquierdo\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/ijerph17165684\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c5eaee50511690625bff3716d84cbf06f8c939f2b5c9f8c5d42f95a6bcada82f\",\"relevance\":5},{\"id\":\"4c09c31faf0b23aa8a9661dc3b3328fcafb88510ed694b2d607b8cfa23ca3e0a\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.infad.eu\\/RevistaINFAD\\/OJS\\/index.php\\/IJODAEP\\/article\\/view\\/1859\\/1638; http:\\/\\/www.infad.eu\\/RevistaINFAD\\/OJS\\/index.php\\/IJODAEP\\/article\\/view\\/1859; doi:10.17060\\/ijodaep.2020.n1.v2.1859\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/www.infad.eu\\/RevistaINFAD\\/OJS\\/index.php\\/IJODAEP\\/article\\/view\\/1859; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17060\\/ijodaep.2020.n1.v2.1859\",\"title\":\"Can human beings achieve happiness? ; \\u00bfPuede el ser humano alcanzar la felicidad?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The human being moves the pieces of his own life to achieve his happiness. In the work, the very possibility of achieving happiness is radically questioned, starting from a kind ofagnosiaabout itsconception asafinalstage. Theapproved ideas of happinessarestillalivein our day, increasingly and in more disciplines, especially in Western societies (Bueno, 2011). It draws attention to the two-sided aspect of happiness, physical, on the one hand, and spiritual on the other. It is concluded that it is very difficult for us to achieve the maximum and permanent degree of happiness or complete happiness. We may assume the weight and responsibility of achieving maximum happiness but, like Sisyphus, carrying the gigantic stone to the top of the mountain over and over again, we can never stay there, in that ideal or emotional territory that we know little about and that is shaped like an asymptote. With regard to the possibility of being happier to a greater or lesser extent, the proposal of Abraham Maslow\\u2019s gradual pyramid is suggestive. The conclusion is optimistic, understanding that relative happiness encompasses a very variable range and is not an end point.

Starting from ancient times, people today, and people in the future always want the same thing as happiness. The concept of happiness is not something new for both the world of Sufism and philosophy, therefore the concept of happiness experiences the dynamic development of the concept. Hamka is one of the scholars in Indonesia who discusses the concept of happiness, but Hamka has its own characteristics in explaining happiness. According to Hamka, happiness actually exists in every human being, happiness can be achieved from inside, not from outside, happiness that comes from outside of ourself is only as a complement to happiness inside, happiness can be achieved if humans always hone and develop tools which can be used to achieve happiness and these tools are religion, reason, and mind. These three things have a relationship with each other, if humans are able to develop these three things then humans can achieve happiness in their lives. In achieving happiness, these three things can be applied by using several methods namely zuhud, sincere, qana\\u2019ah and tawakal. The background of this research will explain the concept of happiness in the modern mysticism of Hamka. This research is a library research, and to make it more functional and useful, this paper will be equipped by a description method, interpretation and analysis of data in detail for each problem raised, therefore it can obtain a comprehensive understanding. happiness; zuhud; Sufism; philosophy Refleksi: Jurnal Filsafat dan Pemikiran Islam; Vol 19, No 2 (2019); 205-220 ; 2548-4745 ; 1411-9951 Arrasyid, Arrasyid\"},{\"id\":\"9fc6da7c9a336e2f87965410347060f68e6eac61053584a333bb806e9555c747\",\"content\":\"Measuring Employee Happiness in the UAE \\u2013 Integrating Organisational Data into the National Statistics Measuring happiness is a complicated process as the concept of happiness cannot be universally defined, collectively experienced or scientifically measured. Further, the lag between when happiness is experienced and when a happiness research report is produced makes intervention efforts ineffective and occasionally redundant. In the current literature, confusions exist in terms of definitions of happiness, well-being and whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an accurate measure of a nation\\u2019s development. Within the organisational context however, little research is carried out on happiness leading whilst at the practical level, some nations including the United Arab Emirates and Bhutan, are currently promoting several happiness initiatives in order to become a happier nation and, perhaps, influence the country\\u2019s productivity. We have proposed a simple data collection approach at the organisational level that will collect daily happiness data per each employee. The micro data collection process is different from the big data normally gathered by the state departments in the sense that it is timely, captures the individualized account of happiness which, we recommend, should be correlated with organisational productivity and fed into the overall national statistics on Gross National Product (GNP) and public well-being.

To enhance an individual???s happiness, we need to be aware of what situations and environmental conditions are conducive for happiness and explore the values of happiness we pursue. This study investigated the types of happiness expressed by Korean people using a mixed-method approach. Personal in-depth (n = 15) and focus group (n = 16) interviews were conducted with people who reported feeling a high level of happiness. Happiness categorization was conducted using Q methodology (n = 63). Subsequently, we surveyed 999 nationally representative samples of Korean adults to generalize the results of the Q analysis. The findings revealed seven types of adult happiness in Korea: (1) Self-actualization, (2) Belongingness, (3) Mission, (4) Social recognition, (5) Enjoyment, (6) Material success, and (7) Parenting. The combined results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that in Korea, people pursuing money or social success feel the unhappiest, whereas people pursuing a mission or sense of belonging feel the happiest. In conclusion, we discussed the need for happiness literacy education, to provide each adult an opportunity to understand the type of happiness they pursue.

In choosing to frame my question with the word 'happiness', I am guided by the desire to draw some comparative lessons for Western philosophy. 'Happiness' has been a central concept in Western ethics, and especially in Aristotelian and utilitarian ethics. The early Chinese concept most relevant to discussion of Mengzi and Zhuangzi concerns a specific form of happiness designated by the word le, which is best rendered as 'contentment'. For both Mengzi and Zhuangzi, there is a reflective dimension of happiness that consists in acceptance of the inevitable transformations of life and death, though these two thinkers chart very different paths to such acceptance. Mengzi holds that it lies in identification with a moral cause much larger than the self. Zhuangzi is profoundly skeptical about the viability of such a path to contentment. He instead offers identification with a world that transcends human good and evil, and a way to live in the present that can be deeply satisfying. One interesting outcome of both their discussions of achieving happiness is that both come to question the importance of happiness as a personal goal.

We collected data on the happiness from 145 Hadza, and compared it with data obtained from 156 Poles, representing Westernized society. Participants were asked to answer four simple questions from Subjective Happiness Scale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999). Results indicate that Hadza report a higher level of happiness with their lives than do Polish people. Our findings also show that sex was not related to happiness in both populations, while age was a negative predictor of happiness, but only among Poles.

As part of well-being, the pursuit of happiness should be understood as a fundamental human goal for all nations and integrate the public policy objectives. The aim of this study is to find the variables explaining happiness in order to provide scientific knowledge to be addressed in public policies. Although the literature suggests that happiness is predicted by multiple factors, the proposed hypothesis suggests the existence of an overlapping model in the different databases, whose common factors stand out from a panoply of other factors as determinants of happiness. Data were collected from three international and reliable databases and a multivariate analysis was conducted. It was found absence of a significant association between happiness and other aspects of existence, considered as determinants of happiness, namely, religion, work and significant others. It was also found that satisfaction with life and health are the main contributors to happiness, considering that the material issues of existence also explain happiness, although in a less expressive way. These variables can be the key to happiness. Investing in health policies, guaranteeing access to adequate income and freeing people from material constraints, involving body and money, may allow people to focus on the higher needs of the Maslow pyramid, and this may eventually lead to greater happiness. ; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/publishedVersion 2030 Agenda; Happiness; Psychological well-being; Health status; Inequality  Leite, \\u00c2ngela; e Sousa, H\\u00e9lder Fernando Pedrosa; Vidal, Diogo Guedes; Dinis, Maria Alzira Pimenta\"},{\"id\":\"b0002a336735c0d7c53a1ccc597c256ffa7b1a9d87516422894d2051014c346b\",\"content\":\"Happiness is a warm gun? Gun ownership and happiness in the United States (1973\\u20132018) Although there is no empirical evidence linking gun ownership with happiness, speculation is widespread. In this paper, we assess the association between gun ownership and happiness. We use 27 years of national cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey (1973\\u20132018) and logistic regression to model self-rated happiness as a function of gun ownership (n = 37,960). In bivariate and partially adjusted models, we observed that the odds of being very happy were higher for respondents who reported having a gun in their home. This association persisted with adjustments for age, gender, race\\/ethnicity, education, employment status, household income, financial satisfaction, financial change, number of children, religious attendance, political affiliation, urban residence, region of interview, and survey year. In our fully adjusted model, gun ownership was unrelated to happiness. The original association between gun ownership and happiness was entirely confounded by marital status. In other words, gun owners only appeared happier because they are more likely to be married, which increases happiness. In the first study of gun ownership and happiness, we found that people who own guns and people who do not own guns tend to exhibit similar levels of happiness. This general pattern was consistent across nearly three decades of national surveys, a wide range of subgroups, and different measures of happiness. Our analyses are important because they contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology of happiness. They also indirectly challenge theoretical perspectives and cultural narratives about how guns contribute to feelings of safety, power, and pleasure.

Our analytical sample included 42,201 Black and White adults. The independent variable was SRH. Happiness was the dependent variable. Sociodemographic factors were covariates. Race was the moderator. Logistic regression was used to analyze the data without and with interaction terms between race and SRH.Results: Overall, good SRH was positively associated with happiness, however, there was a significant interaction between race\\/ethnicity and good SRH on the outcome (i.e.happiness) . This finding suggested that the boosting effect of good SRH on happiness is weaker for Black than White people.Conclusion: In the United States, due to a weaker concordance between good health and happiness, Blacks who have poor SRH are more likely to report happiness. At the same time, Whites who are healthy report happiness, however, Blacks who are healthy do not necessarily report happiness. Disjointed link between health and happiness may be due to different racial, ethnic, and cultural perceptions of physical health and happiness as well as salience of physical health as a component of happiness.

Logistic regression was used to analyze the data without and with interaction terms between race and SRH.Results: Overall, good SRH was positively associated with happiness, however, there was a significant interaction between race\\/ethnicity and good SRH on the outcome (i.e. happiness) . This finding suggested that the boosting effect of good SRH on happiness is weaker for Black than White people.Conclusion: In the United States, due to a weaker concordance between good health and happiness, Blacks who have poor SRH are more likely to report happiness. At the same time, Whites who are healthy report happiness, however, Blacks who are healthy do not necessarily report happiness. Disjointed link between health and happiness may be due to different racial, ethnic, and cultural perceptions of physical health and happiness as well as salience of physical health as a component of happiness. This may be an adaptive response of Blacks to sociopolitical as well as health-related adversities over centuries as a result of the combination of oppression, injustice, and poverty.Keywords: population groups, Blacks, Whites, race\\/ethnicity, self-rated health, happiness Psychology Research and Behavior Management  Cobb,Sharon; Javanbakht,Arash; Khalifeh Soltani,Ebrahim; Bazargan,Mohsen; Assari,Shervin\"},{\"id\":\"449181b6d701a039422b5ae6869434564dc7bbcd3d671d9f5ad024fad949036c\",\"content\":\"Personal and Family Correlates to Happiness amongst Italian Children and Pre-adolescents This study examines how family functioning, the parent-child relationship and personal factors are related to happiness in 1549 children aged 7 to 14 years old (53% females) in Italy.

The Lancet Commission and Sustainable Development Report 2019 recently proposed that subjective wellbeing (measured using a questionnaire-based measure of happiness) could be an additional indicator of mental health in the SDGs. However, the extent to which happiness taps into a different component of mental health compared to suicide is understudied at the population level. In one recent study the association between suicide and happiness across communities in Hong Kong was largely explained by their close relationships with socioeconomic factors; likewise any association between national suicide rates and happiness could be due to shared socioeconomic influences on both these measures.

Mind-wandering was found to be negatively correlated with happiness and positive effects. Higher mind-wandering-related scores went hand in hand with scores related to both lower happiness and positive affects. Approximately half the participants yielded low mind-wandering and negative affect scores and above-average happiness and positive affects scores. In addition, one in four scored above average in terms of mind-wandering and low in terms of happiness and positive effects. Finally, the mediating role played by affects was examined. It can be concluded that although in principle mind-wandering has no direct effect on happiness, some influence can be attested when affects, both positive and negative, are taken into consideration. mind-wandering; affects; happiness; mediation; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350 Sustainability, Vol 12, Iss 5139, p 5139 (2020) Carlos Salavera; Pablo Us\\u00e1n\"},{\"id\":\"581faa80f4fa121e78f9654bc8b0bfb88a88b93d969d990904b044eff60df77d\",\"content\":\"HAPPINESS AND WORKING HOURS IN INDONESIA Humans strive to achieve happiness throughout their lives; thus, every activity has the goal of attaining happiness in mind. Happiness is an essential indicator of good livelihood for humans; if people are not happy, then the quality of life will be reduced. This paper aims to analyze the effect of working hours on happiness in Indonesia by using cross-section data sourced from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) wave 5 of 2014. The model is divided into quadratic models and grouped working hours; the methods used in this paper were the ordered logit for the primary model and the ordinary least square for comparison. The results showed that a quadratic pattern of working hours, where initially working hours would increase happiness, but after reaching a certain peak point, the addition of working hours would cause a decrease in happiness.

Even the fulfillment of the most basic needs is motivated to achieve it. However, the measure of happiness becomes very difficult to determine. In this context, al-Qur'an guides by mentioning various redactions that have the meaning of happiness, such as al-sur\\u00fbr. Therefore, this study aims to find the happiness fulfillment model described in the Qur'an. This study uses the interpretation of al-Sha'rawi, to narrow the scope of meaning, which is considered more relevant to the context of modern society. This research uses a literature study method with data analysis techniques using the approach of Abraham Maslow\\u2019s hierarchy of needs. This research concludes that al-Sha\\u2019r\\u00e2w\\u00ee interprets the word al-sur\\u00fbr as happiness in the world and the hereafter. In the world, happiness is achieved by enjoying sensory beauty, while in the afterlife, it will be achieved by behaving obediently in the world. The achievement of happiness is precisely obtained by fulfilling the needs following the hierarchy of happiness. At the early stage, happiness is achieved through theological belief. This belief will lead to sensory happiness in the world.

To enhance an individual\\u2019s happiness, we need to be aware of what situations and environmental conditions are conducive for happiness and explore the values of happiness we pursue. This study investigated the types of happiness expressed by Korean people using a mixed-method approach. Personal in-depth ( n = 15) and focus group ( n = 16) interviews were conducted with people who reported feeling a high level of happiness. Happiness categorization was conducted using Q methodology ( n = 63). Subsequently, we surveyed 999 nationally representative samples of Korean adults to generalize the results of the Q analysis. The findings revealed seven types of adult happiness in Korea: (1) Self-actualization, (2) Belongingness, (3) Mission, (4) Social recognition, (5) Enjoyment, (6) Material success, and (7) Parenting. The combined results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that in Korea, people pursuing money or social success feel the unhappiest, whereas people pursuing a mission or sense of belonging feel the happiest. In conclusion, we discussed the need for happiness literacy education, to provide each adult an opportunity to understand the type of happiness they pursue. korean adult; types of happiness; subjectivity; q methodology; mixed-method approach; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 5, p 1502 (2020) Young Yim Doh; Ji-Bum Chung\"},{\"id\":\"d74056950124b79f41fd9b083264c321637523f57951563e51a86fecb001959e\",\"content\":\"Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness: Presentation of the National Happiness and Positivity Programme - Qualitative Analysis Scientific research on the question of how happiness can be increased and then sustained has still a long way ahead. The authors have been developing studies in this field and have chosen the happiness initiatives of the Dubai and UAE government to elaborate a case study. This paper, extracted from the wider investigation, presents a study based on government communication on the creation of the Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness. In the scope of this work we have chosen the National Happiness and Positivity Programme of the Dubai and United Arab Emirates Ministry of Happiness. Using the technique of content analysis, through the use of webQDA software, the aim was to understand how the government communicated its strategy for happiness and which are the most used concepts to capture the attention of institutions and citizens. Consequently, the aim was to understand what actions the government has advocated to implement the said programme. The results imply that the concept of positivity has a focus that is very close and complementary to that of happiness. It is also inferred that the government intends to promote 'happiness as a way of life\\u2019, and also to involve the private sector in the National Happiness and Positivity Programme. Finally, the author\\u2019s contribution to this research field is to demonstrate that this model of positivity and sustainable happiness can be extensively implemented, including in the academy.

In his sonnets, Saadi points to features that create happiness and invites people towards serenity and contentment and far from sorrowfulness and grief. In Saadi's sonnets, the components of external and aphasic happiness as well as inner and infinitive happiness can be studied. The outer components of happiness, such as enjoying the beauties of nature and spring, pleasurable memories, being in the company of friends, songs, music and dance; also additionally, inner components of happiness comprising of goodness, justice, etc. Hence, the most imperative factor in regard to happiness is love. In this article, in addition to the external happiness factors mentioned, the main factor of the manifestation of joyfulness which is love will be discussed. Love is considered as the gem of Iranian painting in such a way that it is impossible to isolate the theme from the structure of the painting. This article relies on library studies and is based on a descriptive and content analysis method. Research questions: 1. To what extent is happiness reflected and manifested in Iranian paintings? 2. What effect has the concept of happiness had on the structure of the paintings? Research aims: 1. A study of the concept of happiness expressed in Saadi's sonnets manifested in Iranian painting. 2.

However measuring happiness has been elusive and until now has almost exclusively been done by asking survey questions about self-perceived happiness. We propose a novel approach, tracking happiness and stress through changes in body signals with a smartwatch, the \\u201cHappimeter\\u201d. It predicts individual emotions from sensor data collected by an Android Wear smartwatch, such as acceleration, heartbeat, and activity. The Happimeter was used over three months in the innovation lab of a bank with 22 employees to measure individual happiness, activity, and stress. The participants were randomly divided into an experimental and a control group of similar size. Both groups wore the watch and entered their subjective happiness, activity and stress levels several times a day. The user-entered ratings were then used to train a machine learning system using the sensors of the smartwatch to subsequently automatically predict happiness, activity, and stress. The experimental group received ongoing feedback about their mood and which activity, sensor signals, or other people, made them happier or unhappier, while the control group did not get any feedback about their predicted and manually entered emotions. Just like in quantum physics we observed a \\u201cHeisenberg Effect\\u201d, where the participants made aware of their measurements changed their behavior: Members of the experimental group that received happiness feedback were 16% happier, and 26% more active than the control group at the end of the experiment.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between happiness and mental health with social capital of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences employees. Instrument & Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 200 employees of Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in 2019. Data were collected using GHQ-28 General Health, Oxford Happiness and Social Capital questionnaires. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 software using independent t-test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression. Finding: The mean age of participants was 40.40\\u00b18.18 years. The happiness of 57.5% of the participants was moderate, 54.5% had poor mental health, and 60.5% reported high social capital. Happiness and mental health predicted social capital and explained 9.2% of its variance changes. A good place to live had significant relationship with happiness and high social capital (p<0.01), but did not have relationship with mental health (p= 0.294). Also the mean scores of social capital, mental health, and happiness showed significant relationship with self-assessment of individual health, self-assessment of happiness, and life satisfaction (p<0.05).

The repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the groups by determining the effect of the happiness score before the intervention (P<0.0001). Implications for Practice: According to the obtained results, spiritual interventions increased the happiness level of the female elderly. Therefore, it is concluded that spiritual interventions can be considered practical approaches to improve the happiness of the elderly. aging; happiness; nurse; spiritual care; Nursing; RT1-120; Gynecology and obstetrics; RG1-991 Journal of Evidence-Based Care, Vol 10, Iss 1, Pp 36-43 (2020) Toktam Ayyari; Raha Salehabadi; Sedighe Rastaghi; Mostafa Rad\"},{\"id\":\"09e424362dd881a386fb92b56bcb69921f43fbfa68f72e2d46a257a8cbac22fe\",\"content\":\"Higher Education, Happiness, and Residents' Health The study proposes a new mechanism by which higher education affects the health of residents, showing that higher education can first improve the happiness of residents and then improve their health. In this research, we employ the data collected in Chinese General Social Survey in 2013 and adopt the semiparametric estimation methodology of ordered probit model. Our main findings include the following. First, compared with the residents without higher education, residents with high education enjoy better health conditions, and residents' happiness also significantly affects their health conditions. Second, higher education may have a long-term impact on residents' health by affecting their happiness. Third, the results of grouping test demonstrate that, with the increase in age, the influence of residents' happiness on health is more pronounced, but the mechanism of higher education to improve health status by improving residents' happiness becomes unobvious. Furthermore, we adopt the Shapley value decomposition methodology to decompose the effects of various factors on residents' health. We find that with the increase in age, happiness contributes more and more to residents' health conditions. higher education; happiness; health; semiparameter estimation; shapley value decomposition; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Hong Tan; Jin Luo; Ming Zhang\"},{\"id\":\"403ad03f701892630902a6d70437c24105c14eee8c7a5bf90ecee4b333c265fa\",\"content\":\"Measuring Instruments for Human Resource Management and Employee Happiness Instrument, HRM, Employee Happiness, Measure, Organization, HR professionals.A contextual endeavor is made to discover trending and highly focused sector on measuring Human Resource Management (HRM) functions together with employee happiness. Although in the present-day human resource professionals accept the essentiality of sound human resource management and employee happiness in achieving organizational strategic objectives successfully, they are continuously struggling to assess these two areas as there is a knowledge gap on measuring instruments. This study was carried out to address the contextual niche on measuring human resource practices along with employee happiness and aimed to answer three research questions as there is a significant need to assess these areas practically. An extensive inspection of literature has done to answer the research questions of the study i.e. (1) what is HRM? (2) what is employee happiness? (3) how to measure HRM and employee happiness? The desk research strategy was adopted to answer these research questions.

For this purpose, this study focused on the causal relationships among the frequency of exercise, self-esteem, stress, depression, school satisfaction and degree of happiness in elementary, junior high and high school students (n = 11,132) in South Korea. The data used for this study were collected in 2016 by the National Youth Policy Institute (NYPI) for the \\u201cUN convention on the rights of the child.\\u201d The results were as follows; firstly, the exercise frequency had a significant causal relationship with self-esteem, stress, school satisfaction and happiness but not with depression. However, it was found that exercise frequency had an indirect effect on depression through stress. In detail, exercise frequency could positively reduce stress, and less stress affects depression. Secondly, there were significant direct or indirect effects on self-esteem, stress, depression, degree of happiness and school satisfaction.

The participants were 24 healthy university students (11 males, 13 females; mean age 22.4 \\u00b1 2.1). Their subjective happiness was measured by the Japanese Subjective Happiness Scale (JSHS). Furthermore, their subjective and objective sleep evaluation was measured by Ogri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version (OSA-MA) and a non-contact sheet sensor (SS). The results indicated that participants with higher subjective happiness had objectively shorter sleep onset latency, higher sleep efficiency, and lower heart rate during sleep. On the other hand, no such correlations were found between subjective sleep evaluation with OSA and subjective happiness. These results suggest that subjective happiness is related with the ability to more easily fall asleep and better sleep efficiency. subjective happiness; subjective sleep; objective sleep; non-contact sheet sensor; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350 Sustainability, Vol 12, Iss 4630, p 4630 (2020) Hisayoshi Okamura; Kengo Mihara; Akira Tsuda; Toshihiro Morisaki; Yoshiyuki Tanaka; Yoshihisa Shoji\"},{\"id\":\"b1e885f162d1ad4bf8891aedb281864e037eba39c0e7ac32933c3b0eb66ba58b\",\"content\":\"The Mediating Role of Positive and Negative Affects in the Relationship Between Self-Esteem and Happiness Background: Affects, both positive and negative, can act as mediators between self-esteem and happiness. The present study is undertaken among 812 university students in order to examine the relationship between these variables. Methods: The sample included 812 university students - 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) - who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study. Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness. Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness. More research is needed to examine to what extent these results can be extrapolated, and how to design measures to improve psychological health and well-being.

A total of 1,766 adolescents from 20 secondary schools in peninsular Malaysia completed a questionnaire on demographic background information and Malay version of Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. Participants were also requested to identify everyday events that made them happy in the last 6 months. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run to determine effects of gender, ethnicity, religion, and location on happiness. None of the main effects and interactions were significant. Correlation analysis revealed that household income, income of father, education of father, education of mother, and academic performance were significantly associated with adolescent\\u2019s happiness. Analysis of the everyday events that were reported to induce happiness suggested these events as related to domains considered salient in an adolescent\\u2019s life, including family, friends, and school. Everyday events are also related to intentional activities. Findings provide better understanding of the key demographic factors and everyday events that contribute to happiness of adolescents in Malaysia.

However, very few studies have connected both approaches to better understand children\\u2019s and adolescents\\u2019 happiness. To address this gap, we used a mixed-method approach, to investigate if the conceptualizations of happiness at school of 744 British children and adolescents could signal differences in autonomy, competence, and relatedness. An initial coding of the responses showed thirteen conceptualizations (i.e., positive feelings, harmony\\/balance, leisure, friends, getting good grades, non-violence, moral actions, purpose, autonomy, competence, teachers, emotional support, and learning). Log-linear models showed that some of the conceptualizations differed across both age groups and gender. Latent class analysis showed that happiness conceptualizations could be classified in five different groups. Interestingly, whereas for children there were no differences; for adolescents, there were differences between classes in their levels of autonomy and relatedness. The implications of these findings for promoting students' well-being at school are discussed.

More recently, several papers have looked beyond the traditional impact on economic growth and instead focused on the effects upon broader human welfare indicators. A separate empirical literature in recent decades has probed into the determinants of happiness and subjective well-being (using either country or household data). Our paper contributes to the literature by bringing these two empirical strands of research together. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that makes use of a large panel dataset to explore the links between changes in happiness across countries and several measures of resource wealth. Consistent with prior empirical evidence of a resource curse in oil-rich nations, we find that oil rents are negatively linked to improvements in happiness over time. This happiness \\u2018resource curse\\u2019 curse appears to be oil-specific and holds both for the levels as well as changes in happiness.

of happiness. The theoretical basis of the economy of happiness involves the study of economic and other factors that determine human happiness, its dependence on the level of economic development of the country and determine the parameters for assessing the level of happiness of society as a whole. The \\u00abEasterlin paradox\\u00bb is highlighted, which notes the limited impact of economic growth on the level of happiness of citizens. Theeconomy of happiness at the macro level is due to happiness at the micro level, in our study - at the University. Its purpose was to determine the level and measure the factors of happiness, and their impact, taking into account modern network communications on the productivity and creativity of students and teachers. The article presents the results of a study of 323 students and teachers of various higher education institutions of Ukraine, interviewed using a cloud questionary created using Google Form. The results of the study showed that most students and teachers are satisfied with life in higher education, believe that the factors of happiness are material, spiritual and social benefits together. It has been proven that young people are generally happier than older people rate, their level of happiness in terms of their role at the University at 4 (on a 5-point scale). It isshown that almost half of the respondents use their time irrationally on the Internet, but they are satisfied with it; most of the respondents would feel happier if they used their time as productively as possible and had the opportunity to spend more time on self-development and creativity. ; \\u041e\\u043f\\u0438\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u043e

Eudaimonic Orientation Moderates the Happiness Benefits of Prosocial Behavior Engaging in prosocial behavior is considered an effective way to increase happiness in a sustainable manner. However, there is insufficient knowledge about the conditions under which such a happiness effect occurs. From a person-activity congruence perspective, we proposed that an individual\\u2019s eudaimonic orientation moderates the effect of prosocial behavior on happiness, whereas hedonic orientation does not. For this purpose, 128 participants were assigned to play a game in which half of them were explained the benevolence impact of playing the game (the benevolence condition), and the other half played the same game without this knowledge (the control condition). Participants\\u2019 eudaimonic and hedonic orientations were assessed before the game, and their post-task happiness were measured after the game. The results showed that participants in the benevolence condition reported higher post-task positive affect than those in the control condition. Furthermore, this happiness effect was moderated by participants\\u2019 eudaimonic orientation\\u2014participants with high eudaimonic orientation reaped greater benefits from benevolence, and their hedonic orientation did not moderate the relationship between benevolence and happiness.

Inadequate sleep is an important public health problem that can affect one in every three adults;however, it received little attention in the economics of happiness research. The objective ofthis article is to examine whether sleep adequacy contributes to the explanation of variation inhappiness index levels across countries. Analysis was undertaken using ordinary least squaresregression method. The dependent variable is the self-reported happiness index developed by theGallup poll and published in the World Happiness Report. Two alternative model specificationswere used. The first included average sleep minutes per country, GDP per capita(purchasingpower parity), unemployment rate, and environmental performance index. The second modelspecification included average sleep minutes per country, GDP (purchasing power parity), andeconomic freedom index. Both model specifications met several robustness checks, and showedoverall significance and significant coefficients. Results showed that an increase in average sleepduration by 10 minutes is associated with an improvement in the happiness score by 0.1 and 0.15points in the first and second model specifications respectively, noting an average happiness scoreof 6.2 in the country sample. The conclusion that sleep duration contributes to explaining variationin happiness levels across countries is a call for policy makers to consider policies targetingimprovement in sleep adequacy as priority, and to direct more resources to further research inthe area of sleep economics. Previous studies in the area of happiness economics did not considersleep in explaining differences in happiness among countries, and previous studies in the area ofeconomics of sleep did not consider the happiness index at a global level.

There is broad evidence for a positive relationship between these three orientations and indicators of positive psychological functioning in a variety of life domains. However, their contribution to well-being at work is understudied. The main aim of this study was testing the relationship between self- and peer-rated orientations to happiness, work related well-being (work satisfaction, work stress), and coping strategies. Further possible mediating effects of the coping strategies on the relationship between orientations to happiness and well-being at work were also examined. The sample consisted of 372 German-speaking Swiss adults (60.3% female), aged between 18 and 65 years (M = 38.9, SD = 10.8) with a minimum of 40% full-time employment. For 100 persons, peer-ratings of the orientations to happiness were available. Our results showed that the life of engagement and, to a lesser extent, the life of meaning are related to work satisfaction. The life of pleasure was associated with lower levels of reported work stress. Further, positive associations between self- and peer-rated orientations to happiness (particularly pleasure) and adaptive coping strategies with stress were also found. Mediation analyses showed that the effects of engagement in general and content-related work satisfaction were mediated mainly by control and negative coping, while the association between meaning and resigned work satisfaction was mediated by positive coping. Negative coping fully mediated the association between the pleasurable life and work stress. Overall, our results indicate that employees\\u2019 orientations to happiness are of importance for experiencing well-being at work. coping; orientations to happiness; positive psychology; work satisfaction; work stress; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Nancy Tandler; Annette Krauss; Ren\\u00e9 T.

Studies showed that happiness has several dimensions and that these are dependent, amongst others, of cultural, economic, and social factors. The aim of this study was to validate a measure that identifies possible dimensions of happiness having as a starting point the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. An online questionnaire with socio-professional items and the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was used. A sample of 1032 individuals from several Portuguese higher education establishments was collected, of which 581 (56.3%) were students, 257 (24.9%) were faculty members, and 194 (18.8%) were non-teaching staff. The sample was divided into two subsamples: sample 1 (n=508) and sample 2 (n=524). A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed on sample 1, followed by Covariance Based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM) on sample 2. The PCA presented results, consistent with the existing theory, for a three-factor model. CB-SEM identified several items with significant correlations with more than one latent variable, which eliminated from the model. A valid model (CFI= .95; TLI= .94; AGFI= .95; RMSEA= .04) was obtained, with three dimensions: Joy (six items); Positivism (nine items); and Reliability (two items). We conclude that a threedimension model is valid for the population under study and should be applied to other populations to deepen the conclusions. These three dimensions may serve as a basis to better understand what influences our happiness and propose interventions to promote it. happiness; joy; positivism; reliability; higher education; Psychology; BF1-990 INFAD, Vol 2, Iss 1, Pp 465-478 (2020) Ana Galv\\u00e3o; Sa\\u00fal Neves de Jesus; Marco Pinheiro; Jo\\u00e3o Viseu\"},{\"id\":\"d07f432e5fe2f80ab156eb628ff43b6db682f524c15c54a0f0af4f089c96c9dd\",\"content\":\"THE VARIOUSITY OF HAPPINESS PERSPECTIVE AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN LEARNING PROCESS Happiness is the ultimate goal of all activities. The desire for happiness makes humans look for the source of happiness that its existence is worthy of several elements of life. Education as one of the crucial elements of life has varied learning models that can increase the willingness of students to learn. The conscious effort to learn becomes more optimal in a happy psychological condition. This research discusses the ultimate happiness in the Koran described with scientific theories of happiness and explains the Quantum theory of happiness in the learning model. The research method used was literature study and content analysis as the data analysis technique. The results of this study indicate that first, happiness in the Koran was not caused by wealth but our faith as a believer. Second, there are endorphins in humans that emit happiness and calmness. Third, someone who is happy will have a change in thoughts, words, actions, facial expressions, and positive muscle activity. Fourth, the learning model that can create happy learning begins with creating happy emotions, giving both material and non-material rewards, and good habituation. Fifth, the understanding about happiness from various perspectives can provide a variety of positive developments in all aspects of life and will lead into a better life.

The present study is undertaken among 812 university students in order to examine the relationship between these variables.Methods: The sample included 812 university students \\u2013 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) \\u2013 who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study.Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness.Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness.

To measure someone's happiness is not easy, many opinions have emerged. Some say happiness can be measured through the satisfaction of one's life, some say happiness is measured through one's income, education, and health. The number of people's opinions to measure one's happiness appears as an indicator of happiness. At present, there are 48 indicators. One of the most accurate is HPI. The HPI indicator is very important for a country to increase the happiness of its people. Example: life expectancy in a country will increase and unemployment will decrease because a person has extensive knowledge and knowledge that is needed both by himself and the company that will accept him as his employee. The purpose of this study is to find out how HDI influences, life expectancy, unemployment on the level of happiness of people in ASIA. In this study using secondary data sources conducted by taking HDI data, life expectancy, unemployment in ASIA, and HPI data on ASIA. The results of the analysis using quantitative methods indicate that the independent variables namely HDI, life expectancy, and unemployment.

There is a timetable specific to the happiness that exists on the stage of history with human beings. All kinds of changes and transformations in the historical process affect the meanings attributed to happiness. Each era experiences happiness and interprets this experience according to its own perspective. Happiness, which was seen as a gift or chance of the Gods in the First Age and accepted to be experienced within the field determined by theology in the Middle Ages, is experienced as an emotion determined by the individual in the modern era. According to modern understanding, happiness is shaped by the idea of satisfying the desires and desires of the individual. This article describes the history of happiness with the processes of change and transformation from Antiquity to the present day.

Consistent with the findings of previous research, the data demonstrated a significant positive association between religious affect and personal happiness: religious students are happier students. Catholic students in Northern Ireland hold a more positive attitude toward Christianity (higher levels of religious affect) than Catholic students in the Republic of Ireland. Nonetheless, there is no significant difference in levels of happiness (personal affect) between Catholic students in the two jurisdictions.

The Mediating Role of Service-Skill Use The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between happiness at work and cross-selling performance in the banking sector. In addition, the mediating effect of service-skill use is analyzed in the relationship between happiness at work and performance. Confirmatory factor analysis is used by means of structural equation models to assess the relationship between happiness at work, service-skill use, and cross-selling performance. A sample of 492 financial service employees is examined. Results reveal that happiness at work positively and directly affects cross-selling performance. The study also shows that service-skill use plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between happiness at work and cross-selling performance. This research expands the theory of the happy productive worker perspective based on the job demands-resources model and defines and conceptualizes service-skill use. Employees who are happier at work cross-sell better, but their service-skill use mediates the effect of happiness at work on cross-selling performance. happiness at work; service-skill use; performance; affective organizational commitment; job satisfaction; engagement; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Andr\\u00e9s Salas-Vallina; Manoli Pozo-Hidalgo; Pedro R.

The current study investigates how goal alignment-the perception that you are engaging in activities that are aligned with personal goals-might be associated with state happiness. We hypothesized that people will feel happier when the activities they are performing are aligned with their goals. The study also explored the roles of goal progress and competence in this relation. Data on goal-activity alignment, goal progress, competence, and state happiness were collected in an experience-sampling study with undergraduate students (N = 159) and a survey study with Amazon MTurk workers (N = 252). Using multilevel analyses and regression analyses, results indicated that participants were happier when they were pursuing activities that were more closely aligned with their goals than when pursuing less goal-aligned activities; the results remained significant after accounting for goal progress. Participants who were more goal aligned on average reported greater state happiness; this effect was nonsignificant when goal progress was accounted for. Results suggest that goal alignment has a significant and unique effect on state happiness and that goal pursuit has very immediate benefits that begin as soon as individuals start doing actions helpful for their personal goals.

According to results of the research; it has not been seen a significant difference in happiness scores of teachers in terms of sex. It has been seen a significant difference in happiness scores in terms of other variables of branch, the thought of professional respectability, enjoying the occupation and the situation of reading book. It has been found that school counsellors have a higher happiness score than branch teachers have, teachers who like their occupations have a higher happiness score than they who do not like their occupations have, teachers who find teaching as a respectable occupation have a higher happiness score than they who do not find teaching as a respectable occupation have. On the other hand, it has been determined that the increase in the number of reading book is effective on happiness. When the relation between optimism and happiness has been investigated, it has been found that there are at a level of .64 relation besides, optimism predicts happiness about 41 percent.

In the nationally representative \\u201c2017 Sierra Leone Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)\\u201d, 18006 adolescent and adult women (15-49 years old) responded to questions on life satisfaction, happiness, optimism and social variables. Linear and logistic regression was used to investigate the associations with life satisfaction, happiness and optimism. Life satisfaction was a mean of 5.6 (range 0-10), the prevalence of being very happy was 35.4% and 93.2% thought their life would be netter in one year\\u2019s time (optimism). In adjusted linear or logistic regression analyses, having primary or more education, higher wealth status, access to media (owing a mobile phone) and not having a functional difficulty (or disability) were associated with higher life satisfaction, happiness and optimism. Belonging to an \\u201cother ethnic group\\u201d was positively and currently tobacco use and FGM were negatively associated with both life satisfaction and happiness. Compared to women who had married or entered a union before they were 18 years old, women who got married when they were 18 years and older had a higher life satisfaction and optimism. The study found that majority of Sierra Leonean adolescents and adult women reported being satisfied with their lives, were happy and optimistic.

The human being moves the pieces of his own life to achieve his happiness. In the work, the very possibility of achieving happiness is radically questioned, starting from a kind ofagnosiaabout itsconception asafinalstage. Theapproved ideas of happinessarestillalivein our day, increasingly and in more disciplines, especially in Western societies (Bueno, 2011). It draws attention to the two-sided aspect of happiness, physical, on the one hand, and spiritual on the other. It is concluded that it is very difficult for us to achieve the maximum and permanent degree of happiness or complete happiness. We may assume the weight and responsibility of achieving maximum happiness but, like Sisyphus, carrying the gigantic stone to the top of the mountain over and over again, we can never stay there, in that ideal or emotional territory that we know little about and that is shaped like an asymptote. With regard to the possibility of being happier to a greater or lesser extent, the proposal of Abraham Maslow\\u2019s gradual pyramid is suggestive. The conclusion is optimistic, understanding that relative happiness encompasses a very variable range and is not an end point. It is proposed to modify the meaning of the term \\u201chappiness\\u201d in the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy of Language, to identify it with \\u201ca variety of states of pleasant spiritual and physical satisfaction\\u201d felicidad; pir\\u00e1mide gradual; maslow; Psychology; BF1-990 INFAD, Vol 2, Iss 1, Pp 425-430 (2020) Sonia Mar\\u00eda Rodr\\u00edguez Huerta\"},{\"id\":\"8cfb455b6c18f97ad2fd6879225d86083974f7db533dd02c6dc5bb95c01ec4dd\",\"content\":\"Inequalities in Life Expectancy and All-Cause Mortality in the United States by Levels of Happiness and Life Satisfaction: A Longitudinal Study Background: Despite having one of the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita levels, United States (US) ranks lower in subjective well-being, including happiness and life satisfaction, compared with European countries. Studies of the impact of happiness and life satisfaction on life expectancy and mortality in the US are limited or non-existent. Using a national longitudinal dataset, we examined the association between levels of happiness\\/life satisfaction and US life expectancy and all-cause mortality. Methods: We analyzed the 2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) prospectively linked to 2001-2014 mortality records in the National Death Index (NDI) (N=30,377). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model survival time as a function of happiness, life satisfaction, and sociodemographic and behavioral covariates. Results: Life expectancies at age 18 among adults with high levels of happiness and life satisfaction were, respectively, 7.5 and 8.9 years higher compared to those with low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. In Cox models with 14 years of mortality follow-up, all-cause mortality risk was 82% higher (hazard ratio [HR]=1.82; 95% CI=1.59,2.08) in adults with little or no happiness, controlling for age, and 36% higher (HR=1.36; 95% CI=1.17,1.57) in adults with little\\/no happiness, controlling for sociodemographic, behavioral and health characteristics, when compared with adults reporting happiness all of the time. Mortality risk was 107% higher (HR=2.07; 95% CI=1.80,2.38) in adults who were very dissatisfied with their life, controlling for age, and 39% higher (HR=1.39; 95% CI=1.20,1.60) in adults who were very dissatisfied, controlling for all covariates, when compared with adults who were very satisfied. Conclusions and Global Health Implications: Adults with higher happiness and life satisfaction levels had significantly higher life expectancy and lower all-cause mortality risks than those with lower happiness and satisfaction levels. These findings underscore the significance of addressing subjective well-being in the population as a strategy for reducing all-cause mortality.

Methods Forty-six couples, in which only one spouse has type 2 diabetes, completed questionnaires on perceptions of spousal support self-efficacy and relationship happiness. Results Using an actor-partner interdependence model, we found that when persons with type 2 diabetes were more confident in their spouse\\u2019s ability to provide them with support regarding their dietary self-care, they reported more relationship happiness. We also found that when their spouse without diabetes was more confident in their own abilities to provide such support to their partner, they reported more relationship happiness. However, the person with diabetes\\u2019 confidence in their spouse\\u2019s support abilities and the spouse\\u2019s confidence in their own support abilities were not associated with the other partner\\u2019s relationship happiness. Conclusions This study offers a unique dyadic perspective on the determinants of happiness for couples in which one spouse has type 2 diabetes. The perceived quality of spousal support appears to be associated with relationship happiness in committed couples managing diabetes, regardless of the actual support received or provided.

Furthermore, the paper explores whether diversity management perceptions mediates the relationship between workplace happiness and organisational citizenship behaviour. Design\\/Methodology\\/Approach: A total of 260 questionnaire from a number of public hospitals in Egypt were analysed using both t-test and Structural Equation Modelling. Findings\\/ Results: We found that female physicians perceive diversity management policies\\/protocols more positively than their male colleagues. Moreover, gender has no or little effect on physicians\\u2019 perceptions of workplace happiness. We also found that workplace happiness positively affects physicians\\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour, and finally, diversity management practices can mediate the relationship between workplace happiness and physicians\\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour. Social and practical implications: We believe that managers can raise the feeling of workplace happiness among their staff if they maintain some personal relationships with physicians, care about the physicians\\u2019 work\\/life balance, promote after work gatherings, initiate coffee time talks, encourage open communication practices and more. Originality: The paper is based on the argument that although employees might be happy in the workplace through (engagement, job satisfaction, affective commitment), however their happiness will be unlikely reflected into a positive organizational citizenship behaviour towards their organisation, except (social exchange theory) they feel or perceive (equity theory) the overall practices of diversity management in that organization positively. Thus, studying the mediating effect of perceptions towards diversity management is mainly our contribution.

The present study is undertaken among 812 university students in order to examine the relationship between these variables.Methods: The sample included 812 university students \\u2013 361 men (44.46%) and 451 women (55.54%) \\u2013 who participated voluntarily. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale, Subjective Happiness Scale and Self-Esteem Scale were the instruments used in this study.Results: The results revealed that men have greater self-esteem and positive affects, while women scored higher in terms of subjective happiness. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the variables under analysis. Positive affects show a strong positive correlation between self-esteem and happiness, while negative affects show a negative correlation. Mediation analysis suggests that affects, both positive and negative, mediate the relationship between self-esteem and subjective happiness. The results of this study may present us with new perspectives concerning the role that affects play between self-esteem and happiness.Conclusion: The data present evidence of the mediating role-played by affects, both positive and negative, in the relationship between self-esteem and happiness.

The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the relationships between physical activity and life satisfaction and happiness in young, middle-aged, and older adults while controlling for demographic characteristics, and (2) the relationships between age and life satisfaction and happiness for different physical activity levels. A total of 2345 healthy adults were recruited. Demographic characteristic, physical activity, life satisfaction, and happiness were collected. Participants were divided into young, middle-aged, and older adult groups based on age, and physical activity was categorized as high, moderate, and low. After controlling for demographic characteristics, participants with high and moderate activity levels had significantly higher life satisfaction and happiness than those with a low activity level across the total population and the three age groups. Age squared was a significant predictor of a positive curvilinear between age and life satisfaction and happiness. Physical activity was significantly related to life satisfaction and happiness in young, middle-aged, and older adults. In addition, life satisfaction and happiness increased with increasing age.

Here, we examined whether everyday exposure to natural environments is associated with state body image outcomes (and, for comparative reasons, state happiness) using an experience sampling method. One-hundred-and-seven participants completed a 30-day experience sampling phase in which they reported their state body image (body weight, body shape, and physical appearance satisfaction), state happiness, and features of the surrounding environment (total = 6,025 responses) at three random time-points each day. Results indicated that being outdoors was associated with significantly higher state body image on all three indicators, but effect sizes were lower compared to effects on state happiness. Specific environment type was also important, with blue-spaces and wood- and grasslands, respectively, having stronger effects than other environments. These results provide evidence that everyday exposure to natural environments is associated with more positive state body image and greater happiness.

A brief review of previous studies on OHI showed the lack of evaluation of OHI fairness\\/equivalence in measuring happiness among identified groups. Methods: To examine the psychometric properties and measurement invariance of the OHI, responses of 500 university students were analyzed using item response theory and ordinal logistic regression (OLR). Relevant measures of effect size were utilized to interpret the results. Differential test functioning was also evaluated to determine whether there is an overall bias at the test level. Results: OLR analysis detected four items across gender and two items across marital status to function differentially. An assessment of effect sizes implied negligible differences for practical considerations. Conclusions: This study was a significant step towards providing theoretical and practical information regarding the assessment of happiness by presenting adequate evidence regarding the psychometric properties of OHI.

This study tested validity of a global self-rated health and a global self-rated happiness measure in a large sample of community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan.Methods: A cross-sectional sample of 3,982 men and women aged 65 or older in Yilan, Taiwan, provided data on global self-rated health and happiness using 100-point numerical scales. The Physical Component Summary of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2) and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale were used to test the validity of the self-rated health item. The Mental Component of that 12-item scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were validators regarding the self-rated happiness item. Criterion validity was tested using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2).Results: The correlations between the self-rated health and happiness measures and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (version 2) validators were positive and statistically significant, supporting convergent validity. Sufficient divergent validity was demonstrated through the negative and significant relationship between the self-rated health item and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale scores and the negative and significant relationship between the self-rated happiness item and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Optimal cut-off scores for physical and mental health states depended on age and gender.Conclusion: The global self-rated health and happiness measures were validated.

We have gathered panel data (from the period 2010 to 2014) of CAF index, happiness index and WGI of 62 countries and cross-sectional data of CAF index, Hofstede index, WGI, happiness index and WVS of 24 countries. The result (of panel data) shows that there is a significant relation of WGI, social support and freedom of choice with CAF index whereas there is an insignificant connection between generosity and CAF index. The findings (of cross-sectional data of all factors combined) shows that there is a relation of the Hofstede index and happiness index with the CAF index while there is no linkage of WGI and WVS with the CAF index. The study suggests that charitable organizations should personify their value in order to build trust among the public. Countries should improve their governance because this will lead to equality and by doing this countries will also manage their resources efficiently and effectively.

Therefore, intervention seems to be essential specifically in elderly women suffered from moderate depression, with the aim of improving psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness. Therefore, the study aimed to determine the effectiveness of stress management training (SMT) on psychological health, self-efficacy and happiness in elderly women with moderate depression. The current study was a quasi-experimental with pretest-posttest and control group design. The statistical population included elderly women with depression residing in nursing homes of Tehran, Iran in 2019, among whom 60 women were selected through purposive sampling and inclusion criteria and allocated randomly into two equal groups.

Methods We conducted a randomized, single-blind, actively-controlled, parallel group study in seven municipalities in the Netherlands. To be eligible, participants had to experience loneliness, health problems and low socio-economic status. Each group received several home visits by a counsellor (two in the control condition, two to six in the experimental condition). In the Happiness Route, a happiness-based approach was used, whereas the control condition used a traditional problem-based approach. The primary outcome was well-being, measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). Results Fifty-eight participants were randomized to the Happiness Route, 50 to the control condition. Participants were severely lonely, had on average three health problems and less than 5% had paid work. The total MHC-SF score, emotional and social well-being, depression and loneliness improved significantly over the nine-month period in both conditions (p < .05), but there were no significant changes between the conditions across time. Languishing decreased significantly from 33% at baseline to 16% at follow-up among the Happiness Route participants but did not change significantly in the control condition. No significant improvement over time was found in psychological well-being, resilience, purpose in life, health-related quality of life and social participation. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that expected saved costs per QALY lost was \\u20ac219,948 for the Happiness Route, relative to the control condition. The probability was 83% that the Happiness Route was cost saving and 54% that the Happiness Route was cost-effective at a willingness to accept a threshold of \\u20ac100,000. Conclusions Mental health status of both groups improved considerably. However, we could not demonstrate that the Happiness Route yielded better health outcomes compared to the control condition. Nevertheless, the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the Happiness Route is an acceptable intervention from a health-economic point of view. Our results should be viewed in light of the fact that we could not include the planned number of participants. Trial registration Netherlands Trial Register: NTR3377 . Registered 2 Apr 2012.

The purpose of the current study is to develop a scale in order to assess the potential for happiness of individuals related to the situation they have identified. The Happiness for Potential Scale is a Likert-type scale consisting of 11 items. The scale has three factors: expectation, knowledge and pleasure. To conduct the validity and reliability study of the scale, the data were collected from 306 participants. The analyses were conducted with 278 participants (63% females and 36% males) after missing observations and outliers were excluded from the data set. The participants&#039; mean age was 31.97, SD = 10.28. The results showed that the items were accumulated under three factors and explained 64.86% of the variance in The Potential for Happiness Scale. Cronbach\\u2019s alpha coefficient was calculated as .65 for expectation factor (3 items), .64 for knowledge factor (3 items) and .88 for pleasure (expression) factor and .86 for the total scale. Based on the findings from the analyses, it could be concluded that the scale which was developed in order to determine the potential for happiness of individuals is a valid and reliable measurement tool. ; Bu ara\\u015ft\\u0131rman\\u0131n konusunu olu\\u015fturan \\u201cmutluluk potansiyeli\\u201d, mutluluk d\\u00fczeyinin de\\u011fi\\u015fkenli\\u011fine (durumluk mutluluk) odakl\\u0131 olan ve mutluluk yaratma ihtimali ile ilgilenen g\\u00f6r\\u00fc\\u015fe dayan\\u0131r ve ki\\u015finin i\\u00e7inde bulundu\\u011fu durumdan doyum sa\\u011flamas\\u0131n\\u0131, sevin\\u00e7 duymas\\u0131n\\u0131 ifade eder.

An experiment (N= 709) using a guided imagination task found that social exclusion led to reduced feelings of happiness. The effect was mediated by future expectations, as participants who imagined a vivid exclusion scenario thought they were more likely to experience actual rejection in the coming weeks. A correlational survey focusing on individual differences found a similar pattern. People who felt a strong sense of general belonging thought they were less likely to experience future rejection than people with weak belonging, and they also reported higher levels of current happiness.

Considering the government\\u2019s goal of serving and improving people\\u2019s livelihoods, improving the happiness of migrant workers is necessary. This study investigates in-depth the impact of the conversion of household registration on migrant workers\\u2019 happiness, which is represented by a multi-dimensional comprehensive index based on the propensity matching score model and data from the China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS) in 2017. Moreover, this study explores the different effects of conversion among the groups divided by the characteristics of migrant workers. The results show that from an overall perspective, although the conversion of household registration could improve the happiness of migrant workers, the degree of this improvement is minor. Further, the characteristics of the different groups, including age, educational background, contracted land, collective dividends, and income significantly affect the improvement of happiness. The conversion of household registration has obviously improved the happiness of migrant workers with low educational backgrounds, low income, and contracted land. Based on these findings, the government should take more targeted actions to improve the positive effects of household registration among different migrant worker groups due to the different characteristics in the process of household registration system reform. household registration; migrant worker; happiness; group difference analysis; Medicine; R International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, Vol 17, Iss 2661, p 2661 (2020) Xin-hao Liu; Li-min Han; Bin Yuan\"},{\"id\":\"78f11bf4253160e698cb0003e30669e19d1ccb888f4d6a66dfcd66c9461c7d9c\",\"content\":\"Potret Kebahagiaan Relawan Studi Kasus Relawan Satya Wacana Peduli di Lombok The main purpose of all activities carried out by humans is to obtain happiness. The same thing happened to Satya Wacana Peduli volunteers who provided assistance directly to the people in Lombok. The purpose of this study is to see a picture of happiness in volunteers who were members of Satya Wacana Peduli. This research was analyzed qualitatively by using a case study approach. The study involved two volunteers who provided assistance in Lombok. The results of the study showed that the picture of happiness in each participant was different. The difference in happiness was influenced by the initial encouragement of participants to provide assistance. The suggestion for the next research is to pay more attention to factors that influence happiness such as personality factors or other factors that make volunteers can feel happiness.

This research aims to find a more precise composite measurement format (index) in quantifying the ultimate achievement of human existence, which is happiness, in Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries. Up until now, Human Development Index (HDI) is considered to be sufficiently representing the measure of human well-being. However, Easterlin (1974) argues that higher welfare does not always imply to higher happiness. Blanchflower and Oswald (2005) prove the statement of Easterlin (1974) by demonstrating the paradox between HDI level and happiness in Australia. Further, the measure of HDI is said to be less representative in reflecting happiness as it has not yet incorporated the element of religiosity. Thus, several of the new composite measures of well-being in Muslim countries have been proposed, one of them is Sharia Maqasid Index constructed by Ali and Hasan (2014). This research attempts to make comparison between HDI and Sharia Maqasid Index and to decide which of the two indices gives the best measure of human happiness. The authors employ Ordered Logit method and use data taken from World Value Survey along the period of 1999-2009 to measure happiness as in Leigh and Wolfers (2006), as well as to measure Sharia Maqasid Index as in Ali and Hasan (2014). Findings of this research can benefit the government of OIC countries to determine a more precise index as a benchmark to set more appropriate public policies.

A translated pre-determined survey on a sample of Jordanian academics was used. A total of 325 usable returns were collected for the analysis (i.e. a response rate of 84.6 percent). Structural equation model (SEM) using AMOS was implemented to obtain the best-fit model and to determine the role of job crafting as a potential mediator between empowering leadership and happiness at work. The results indicated no direct statistical effect for empowering leadership on happiness at work with an estimated value of 0.17 and a standard error of 0.073. The results also show that there was a significant statistical effect for empowering leadership on crafting and this effect was high with a value of 0.479 and a standard error of 0.040. Finally, the results revealed a direct effect for empowering leadership on happiness at work through the mediating role of job crafting. The study recommended that it is necessary for universities to offer new programs and workshops that improve the behaviors of empowering leadership in light of work conditions at various levels and to motivate job crafting to increase levels of happiness at work. empowering leadership; job crafting; task crafting; relationship crafting; happiness at work; Business; HF5001-6182 Business: Theory and Practice, Vol 21, Iss 1 (2020) Mohammed Yasin Ghadi; Khaled Salameh Almanaga'h\"},{\"id\":\"76afd847c4bb2c4cfdf23413ab05900bfd224d9360ade463c6e23a6e3174cea0\",\"content\":\"Okul \\u00d6ncesi D\\u00f6nemde Mutlulu\\u011fa \\u0130li\\u015fkin Betimlemeler ; Descriptions About the Concept of Happiness In Pre-School Period Bu \\u00e7al\\u0131\\u015fman\\u0131n amac\\u0131; okul \\u00f6ncesi d\\u00f6nemdeki 5 ya\\u015f grubu \\u00e7ocuklar\\u0131n mutluluk kavram\\u0131n\\u0131 nas\\u0131l betimlediklerini incelemektir.

The sample (n=120) consists of 16\\u201317 year-old Suvorov Military School and gymnasium students. Overall, negative correlation between feeling of happiness and the level of subjective loneliness was established on the sample. Positive correlations were identified between feeling of happiness and satisfaction of relationships with family, friends and classmates. Correlation with all three relationship subjects were identified referring to the female students. As for the male students, the feeling of happiness is connected only to the satisfaction of relationships with friends and classmates; regarding the Suvorov Military School students, only to the satisfaction of relationship with their friends.

Previous research on adults suggests, in an isolated manner, the relationship between connectedness to nature, the development of behaviors in favor of the environment, and positive results derived from them, such as happiness and well-being. In the present research, connectedness to nature was considered as a determinant of sustainable behaviors, and happiness was considered as a positive consequence of the latter. This research aimed to demonstrate the relationship between these variables in children. Two hundred and ninety-six children with an average age of 10.42 years old participated in the study, in which they responded to a research instrument that measured connectedness to nature, sustainable behaviors (pro-ecological behavior, frugality, altruism, and equity), and happiness. To analyze the relationships between these variables, a model of structural equations was specified and tested. The results revealed a significant relationship between connectedness to nature and sustainable behaviors, which, in turn, impact happiness. This suggests that children who perceive themselves as more connected to nature tend to perform more sustainable behaviors; also, the more pro-ecological, frugal, altruistic, and equitable the children are, the greater their perceived happiness will be. The implications for studying and promoting sustainable behaviors are discussed within the framework of positive psychology. connectedness to nature; sustainable behavior; children; happiness; nature; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Laura Fernanda Barrera-Hern\\u00e1ndez; Mirsha Alicia Sotelo-Castillo; Sonia Beatriz Echeverr\\u00eda-Castro; C\\u00e9sar Octavio Tapia-Fonllem\"},{\"id\":\"4279c3f6a67a4b298ca8c24559dcf3f87c3667cecb8ed4d7b3103db2ba4183a5\",\"content\":\"HRM and its Impact on Employee Happiness: An Empirical Study on Sri Lankan Employees A systematic empirical study was carried out with regard to Human Resource Management (HRM) and Employee Happiness owing to little research done, contextual gap and intellectual curiosity of authors. Objectives of the study were (1) to find the degree of happiness of Sri Lankan employees under study; (2) to find the degree of HRM practices in the organizations where employees are working under study; and (3) to investigate whether there is any positive and significant impact from HRM on employee happiness. The nature of this study was analytical; time horizon was cross sectional; and the unit of analysis was individual. A theoretical framework was formulated based on some empirical evidences in literature review and logical beliefs of the authors. Two different instruments were developed by the authors to measure the employees\\u2019 happiness and HRM practice level of their organizations. Reliability and validity of the instruments are assured. Survey method was utilized and 110 employees responded to the authors developed questionnaire through the sampling technique of convenient sampling technique.

It was a descriptive-correlational study. To do this, a sample of 120 people was selected among all non-resident elderly people in Kermanshah elderly Homes in 2018 using convenience sampling method. The research instruments included Haddad et al. psychological hardiness questionnaire, oxford happiness questionnaire and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire.The collected data were analyzed by SPSS software version 22 using Pearson correlation and regression analysis. The results suggested correlation coefficients of 0.44, 0.47 and 0.38 between the components of psychological hardiness (control, commitment and challenge) and sleep quality, respectively. Also, there was a correlation of 0.56 between happiness and sleep quality (P<0.001). Therefore, it can be said that psychological hardiness and happiness can predict of the quality of sleep in the elderly. Considering the results, it was suggested that health professionals, especially those associated with the elderly, could pay a particular attention to the important role of such variables as happiness. sleep quality; hardiness; happiness; elderly; Psychology; BF1-990 \\u0631\\u0648\\u0627\\u0646\\u0634\\u0646\\u0627\\u0633\\u06cc \\u067e\\u06cc\\u0631\\u06cc, Vol 6, Iss 1, Pp 27-38 (2020) delniya sheikhesmaeili; peyman hatamyan; jahangir karami; elahe lorestani; faramarz morovati\"},{\"id\":\"7ebfbabfaad362f2b3ccf4fa3b2c990d59408c5418f983395674f837ff9d4758\",\"content\":\"Predicting Resilience in Students based on Happiness, Attachment Style, and Religious Attitude Background and Objectives: Nowadays adolescents as the human capital of every society, in addition to the pressures of transition from adolescence period, are affected by environmental pressures, such as poverty, violence, and substance abuse. Given these factors, resilience plays an important role in this period. The present study aimed to investigate the role of happiness, attachment styles, and religious attitudes in predicting the resilience of students. Methods: This descriptive correlational study was performed on 354 students selected through the multistage cluster sampling method from the students of junior high schools in Najafabad, Iran.

In such an encounter, consumers anticipate the emotions they might experience as a result of their decision, as they cannot realistically evaluate product performances. The work investigates the nature and the influence of these future-oriented emotions, namely anticipated and anticipatory happiness, in the first encounter with new products. Through a first laboratory study, adopting both physiological (micro-facial expressions analysis) and self-reported measures, we confirm the distinction between anticipated and anticipatory happiness. We further show the differential impact of these two emotional constructs on the consumer decision-making process by grounding on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Through a second study, based on a questionnaire, we further investigate the role of anticipated happiness within the TPB. We show that anticipated happiness is a pervasive emotional construct that influences all stages of the intention formation process. We discuss how these findings enrich existing knowledge on the interplay between cognitive and affective components of the decision-making process for new products. Moreover, we offer a methodological contribution to the use of physiological methods to assess emotions. anticipated happiness; anticipatory happiness; Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB); micro-facial expressions; decision-making process; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Debora Bettiga; Lucio Lamberti\"},{\"id\":\"7d5e32e71c794dea7047d329a6086091d6106696604f13cf14a4feadf1263dfc\",\"content\":\"Dukungan Sosial, Optimisme dan Kebahagiaan pada Mustahiq Happiness is a hope in the lives of many people, including the Mustahiq.

Questions that arise are, among others, can cultural tourism generate understanding and social cohesion? Consequently, can it also mean increasing the happiness of both tourists and the host population? How and what can be learned from cultural tourism as a peaceful social process? Specifically, a qualitative approach was made in which we conducted semi-structured interviews with people belonging to civil society associations linked to the route. An analysis of the narratives (from the interviews) through the grounded theory was carried out. Improved individual reasons for happiness and social cohesion as a result of positive significant experiences are observed in the first step of results, and an exportable Decalogue of social behavior in cultural tourism experiences is presented and evaluated by the interviewees and shown as a research proposal. sustainable tourism; cultural tourism; individual and social happiness perception; civil society associations Sustainability 2020, 12(8), 3465 Sanagust\\u00edn-Fons, M.

Full-sample estimates reveal that realized volatility is significantly negatively linked to investor happiness at a short forecast horizon. Similarly, out-of-sample results indicate that investor happiness significantly improves the accuracy of forecasts of realized volatility at a short forecast horizon. Results for a medium and a long forecast horizon are insignificant. We argue that our results shed light on the role played by speculation in oil products and the potential function of oil-related products as a hedge against risks in traditional financial assets. investor happiness; oil market; realized volatility; forecasting; Environmental effects of industries and plants; TD194-195; Renewable energy sources; TJ807-830; Environmental sciences; GE1-350 Sustainability, Vol 12, Iss 4309, p 4309 (2020) Matteo Bonato; Konstantinos Gkillas; Rangan Gupta; Christian Pierdzioch\"}]"
