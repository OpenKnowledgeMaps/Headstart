One aspect of the study of the food-stuff consumption refers to the situation of the average yearly consumption\\/inhabitant, in Romania, refers to food-stuff produces and beverages. Another aspect of this study refers to the average daily food-stuff consumption\\/inhabitant, showed in calories and nutritive factors. This indicator is a key-variable in quantifying the regional and global food-stuff consumption. In fact, it is the expression of the national average apparently food-stuff consumption. Of high importance for estimating the development level of a society and especially the life standard of its population are the costs for the food-stuff produces. Otherwise, it is about the percentage from the income that is assigned for food-stuff produces expenses. The expenses dynamic for food-stuff produces and beverages are constantly observed, in all modern countries.

Capillary marketing is one of the most influential techniques in the issue of more sales in organizations especially in terms of selling food stuff. Food stuff should be sold in a short time due to the short durability. People who make better use of capillary marketing to supply their products and services can sell better and faster. Dependency of Iran's economy on oil incomes and affectability of such incomes from political, economic and international issues cause vulnerability and fragility of the economy. One of the ways of coping with this situation is developing new products that improves inland economic condition and causes an increase in non oil exports. Meanwhile, in addition to the role of food stuff in inland economic development, it can have a determining role in non oil export. Most of the families don't have financial ability to respond steamy needs of their children. Such children are just happy with watching colorful food and being influenced by messages they don't tend to traditional food. In fact, advertisements tell children what to wear play and eat.

The film first uses the Hollywood Western, as has been acknowledged by several authors. However, the film also uses other genres, particularly melodrama and comedy as described by Stanley Cavell. In general, film genres help us understand the world. More specifically, the Hollywood Western is the film\\u2019s point of departure for its depiction of the astronaut\\u2019s immediate predecessor \\u2013 the test pilot; yet it is the family melodrama and the comedy that should be acknowledged as more important for understanding the astronaut as the test pilot\\u2019s successor. To be precise, understanding the history of space travel in terms of Hollywood genres requires an examination of the way in which THE RIGHT STUFF has marked the transition from a covert, military operation (test pilots) to a civilian public relations project (astronauts) as the succession of the Western by the family melodrama and the comedy of remarriage.\",\"published_in\":\"Staat, Wim (2016): THE RIGHT STUFF: From Western to melodrama and comedy.

Tracing our understanding of use and participation through literature and case analysis, we use illustrative figures and tables to articulate different types and dimensions of use in relation to one another and in relation to the empirical analysis that is detailed and recounted in various ways. The paper concludes by elaborating how types of use in reference to types of stuff provide insight on participant skills, learning and engagement that can result in change of roles over time.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Design studies; Design Practice\",\"subject\":\"Design studies; Design Practice\",\"authors\":\"Hirscher, Anja-Lisa; Maz\\u00e9, Ramia\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/16128\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"39e8586a342c8f24b2ed685962bb972e47349816d71bbc9cd838aa8b4edbdf3f\",\"relevance\":108,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"f0632bba84f71a88b6292d93ce501adc887a007e311dd709a1386c0785d4bb7b\",\"relation\":\"Hacettepe Sa\\u011fl\\u0131k \\u0130daresi Dergisi; Makale - Ulusal Hakemli Dergi - Kurum \\u00d6\\u011fretim Eleman\\u0131; 1302-9282; https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12451\\/1316; 18; 2; 161; 182\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.12451\\/1316\",\"title\":\"Sigara kullan\\u0131m\\u0131 hastane \\u00e7al\\u0131\\u015fanlar\\u0131n\\u0131n ki\\u015fisel imajlar\\u0131n\\u0131 nas\\u0131l etkiliyor? ; How smoking affects personal \\u0131mage of the hospital staff?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Erdem, \\u0130zzet (Aksaray, Yazar) ; Sigara kullan\\u0131m\\u0131 \\u00e7a\\u011f\\u0131m\\u0131zda en h\\u0131zl\\u0131 yay\\u0131lan ve en fazla \\u00f6nlenebilir halk sa\\u011fl\\u0131\\u011f\\u0131 sorunlar\\u0131ndan birisidir.

Therefore, this article notes four ongoing movements to join and suggests ten different arenas that cry out for action.\",\"published_in\":\"Understanding and Dismantling Privilege; Vol 6 No 2 (2016): UNDERSTANDING AND DISMANTLING PRIVILEGE; 1-15 ; 2152-1875\",\"year\":\"2017-02-15\",\"subject_orig\":\"Race; Education; White Supremacy; Teaching; Strategies\",\"subject\":\"Race; Education; White Supremacy; Teaching; Strategies\",\"authors\":\"Loewen, James W.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\/article\\/view\\/16347\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"9ab3484de20035b25d5dc072eb486c3479692baf8e391dea31466ecda49a7bd2\",\"relevance\":101,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9ca5e74255672e15455e20cb81b22d1aca502b2615518b4894d2f02ee074116e\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/DARRAP-2\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/DARRAP-2\",\"title\":\"Relativism and Progress\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Relativism is a theory about how people organize their beliefs.

Our worsening situation is not due to lack of knowledge, science and technology; in broad terms, we knew most of the challenges and many of the needed solutions back in the 1970s. Instead, the challenges we face are social, rooted in cultural values, political ideologies, legal and economic systems, ethical principles and spiritual\\/religious beliefs.

Capillary marketing is one of the most influential techniques in the issue of more sales in organizations especially in terms of selling food stuff. Food stuff should be sold in a short time due to the short durability. People who make better use of capillary marketing to supply their products and services can sell better and faster. Dependency of Iran's economy on oil incomes and affectability of such incomes from political, economic and international issues cause vulnerability and fragility of the economy. One of the ways of coping with this situation is developing new products that improves inland economic condition and causes an increase in non oil exports. Meanwhile, in addition to the role of food stuff in inland economic development, it can have a determining role in non oil export. Most of the families don't have financial ability to respond steamy needs of their children. Such children are just happy with watching colorful food and being influenced by messages they don't tend to traditional food. In fact, advertisements tell children what to wear play and eat. In this study we are going to discuss marketing of children's food stuff and its advertising methods in Iran.

Previous research (Cheshire 2007; Tagliamonte & Denis 2010; Pichler & Levey 2011) finds suggestive evidence that and stuff and other GEs have undergone grammaticalization over their development. However, when viewed in apparent time, there is little evidence of ongoing grammaticalization; rather only vestiges of apparent previous grammaticalization remain. This paper takes up Pichler and Levey\\u2019s (2011) call for an appropriate real-time benchmark of comparison to enable a more thorough understanding of the historical development of these features. A collection of oral histories recorded in the 1970s and 1980s with elderly residents of three communities in southern Ontario, Canada, is used as a proxy for comparison to Tagliamonte and Denis\\u2019s (2010) analysis of the Toronto English Archive. By tracking the development of and stuff over more than a century of apparent time, this paper finds three changes in progress: (1) a lexical replacement such that and stuff becomes the majority variant in the variable system; (2) a morphological clipping process such that longer GEs such as and stuff like that lose the comparative element like that; and (3) the semantic bleaching of the set-marking meaning of and stuff. While this last change is a necessary part of grammaticalization, in the absence of phonetic reduction, decategorialization, and pragmatic shift, it is not sufficient evidence according to grammaticalization theory (e.g., Heine 2003; Traugott 2003; Diewald 2010).\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of English Linguistics ; volume 45, issue 2, page 157-185 ; ISSN 0075-4242 1552-5457\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"Linguistics and Language;

The wastewater can be characterized as a highly variable, highly colored wastewater. A biological wastewater treatment plant uses a natural biological process-metabolism, to destroy waste organic matter. The most important parameter in the Arthur Operation Strategy is \\u201dtreatment time\\u201d. The main purpose of this research is to evaluate the treatability-toxicity of the dye stuff and paper wastewater by using the Arthur Instrument. This work points out that changes in degrees of treatability, due to changes in substance of samples, were shown by developing reaction rate and oxygen volume consumption graphs. These graphs were developed from the data obtained from a series of tests at various samples to activated sludge. In this research the important point was that the toxins were tested using the mixed liquor from dye stuff and paper industry giving us a direct indication of the toxic effect and an actual measurement of the treatment time. Based entirety on biological measurements, we have an actual message of the length of time it takes for the microbes in dye stuff and paper industry to treat the waste coming into aeration basin. Finally, this paper shows that the best treatment process for dye stuff and paper industry is two-stage activated carbon sludge process.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"1996-03\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u751f\\u7269\\u8655\\u7406; Arthur\\u5100\\u5668; \\u6d3b\\u6027\\u78b3\\u6ce5; \\u8655\\u7406\\u505c\\u7559\\u6642\\u9593; \\u56de\\u6536\\u518d\\u5229\\u7528; Arthur Instrument; Reaction Rate; Microbe; Biodegradable; Activated Carbon Sludge; Treatment Time; Dye Stuff\",\"subject\":\"\\u751f\\u7269\\u8655\\u7406; Arthur\\u5100\\u5668; \\u6d3b\\u6027\\u78b3\\u6ce5; \\u8655\\u7406\\u505c\\u7559\\u6642\\u9593; \\u56de\\u6536\\u518d\\u5229\\u7528; Arthur Instrument; Reaction Rate; Microbe; Biodegradable; Activated Carbon Sludge; Treatment Time; Dye Stuff\",\"authors\":\"\\u937e\\u5ef6\\u6625; \\u8a31\\u5609\\u5f70; \\u738b\\u4fe1\\u6613\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.lib.pccu.edu.tw\\/\\/handle\\/987654321\\/28805\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1c775470c3e102d38d472d521b39447c4d9a490bd029efb6a1dd989a82a4d15b\",\"relevance\":90,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"47351f8f6c34bd2a517dfc0daf9631022f3b805cf404328932e67da364777f46\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/psasir.upm.edu.my\\/55420\\/1\\/David%20Hare%E2%80%99s%20Stuff%20Happens.pdf; Salih, Elaff Ganim and Kaur, Hardev and Hassan, Mohamad Fleih (2016) David Hares stuff happens a dramatic journey of American war on Iraq.

The tragic consequences of this war led many writers around the world to question the policy of the United States and its manipulation of facts to justify their narratives. The present study examines the American policy of invading Iraq in David Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens. It investigates Hare\\u2019s technique of combining documentary realism with imaginative reconstruction of the arguments to dramatize the American Invasion of Iraq. Stuff Happens is a historical and political play written as a verbatim theatre. It depicts the backroom deals and political maneuvers of the Bush administration in justifying their campaign against the \\u2018Axis of Evil\\u2019 culminated by the war against Iraq. The verbatim theatre is the best way of showing the gap between \\u2018what is said and what is seen to be done\\u2019. Scenes of direct speeches by real characters are part of this theatre dramatized to present a new reading of a historical event. In addition, characterization is used by Hare\\u2019s to chronicle the American war on Iraq. The study follows a postcolonial framework. The study concludes that Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens succeeded in shaking the public opinion with the truth that Bush\\u2019s administration has manipulated facts in order to achieve their colonial and imperial interests in Iraq, which led to more destruction and violence in this country.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Salih, Elaff Ganim; Kaur, Hardev; Hassan, Mohamad Fleih\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/psasir.upm.edu.my\\/55420\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"47351f8f6c34bd2a517dfc0daf9631022f3b805cf404328932e67da364777f46\",\"relevance\":89,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"c7a007b9ac1c14d46c6e4cdf695076edfb723be25de4e6f2b04103839ec95e75\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\\/portal\\/en\\/publications\\/alternative-proteins-and-the-nonstuff-of-meat(4d057075-f854-4a4d-9730-c4bf21fef3b2).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1525\\/gfc.2016.16.3.66; https:\\/\\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\\/ws\\/files\\/56791990\\/Sexton2016_Alternative_proteins_and_non_stuff_of_meat.pdf\",\"title\":\"Alternative Proteins and the (Non)Stuff of \\\"Meat\\\"\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Beyond Meat, a food technology company based in California, is currently developing a range of plant-based proteins that aim to provide more sustainable, ethical, and healthful alternatives to conventional meat. Its products are also aiming to be viscerally equivalent in terms of their meatlike taste, texture, and overall sensory experience. These alternative proteins (APs) are not, however, intended merely as a substitute for conventional meat. Instead they are viewed and marketed by their developers as meat, made simply from a different raw material and via different methods. Yet as animal meat has become increasingly linked with environmental, health, and ethical concerns, Beyond Meat is having to negotiate a careful balance between positioning its products as meatlike in some respects and not meatlike in others in order to gain consumer adoption. To become \\u201cmeat\\u201d in consumer thinking not only depends on the things these APs are made of\\u2014both material and ideological\\u2014but also the things that are actively excluded; as such, their materiality is made of purposefully chosen \\u201cstuff\\u201d and \\u201cnon-stuff.\\u201d The article explores this decision making via my fieldwork encounters with Beyond Meat\\u2019s products. Using a visceral-autoethnographic approach, I discuss how certain (non)stuff was \\u201cmade to matter and not matter\\u201d (Evans and Miele 2012) to me during these encounters, and how this careful balancing of stuff can create new and problematic imaginaries, moral politics, and misguided understandings of what constitutes \\u201cbetter\\u201d foods and \\u201cbetter\\u201d eaters.

In those formative years of aviation and jet development, designers and pilots did not have the same design understanding and knowledge that we have today. In addition, they did not have the same understanding and knowledge of Systems Safety engineering and Human Factors expertise that we have today. Manned suborbital flights of today should be undertaken in vehicles that have been designed effectively with appropriately derived safety requirements including fault-tolerance, safe life and design-for-minimum risk approaches \\u2013 and all to an acceptable level of safety. Therefore, although initial suborbital pilots will originate from flight test schools and still possess similar traits to their earlier test pilot brethren, they should be protected by the right (safe) thing by design and analysis rather than rely on the right stuff due to ineffective design and operating procedures. The paper presents a review of the SpaceShip2 accident as a case study to highlight the right (safe) things that should be considered in the design, analysis and operations for suborbital operators.

We study inclusive processes and argue that the inclusive production of unparticle stuff in standard model processes due to the unparticle self-interactions can be decomposed using the conformal partial wave expansion and its generalizations into a sum over contributions from the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff, corresponding to different primary conformal operators. Such processes typically involve the production of unparticle stuff associated with operators other than those to which the standard model couples directly. Thus just as interactions between particles allow scattering processes to produce new particles in the final state, so unparticle self-interactions cause the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff. We discuss both inclusive and exclusive methods for computing these processes. The resulting picture, we believe, is a step towards understanding what unparticle stuff \\u201clooks like\\u201d because it is quite analogous to way we describe the production and scattering of ordinary particles in quantum field theory, with the primary conformal operators playing the role of particles and the coefficients in the conformal partial wave expansion (and its generalization to include more fields) playing the role of amplitudes. We exemplify our methods in the 2D toy model that we discussed previously in which the Banks-Zaks theory is exactly solvable. ; Physics\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2010\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Georgi, Howard;

We argue that while there are radically different contexts and cases and governance regimes still to be debated, what we call \\\"genomic stuff\\\"-genomic material, data, and information-often can best be regulated by modes of stewardship and self-regulation of appropriators. We exemplify this claim by a discussion of gene patenting, the \\\"Genome War\\\", and the so-called HapMap project.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the \\\"Law of the few\\\", the \\\"Stickiness factor\\\", and the \\\"Power of context\\\". For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as \\\"interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks\\\", for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.\",\"published_in\":\"Rutten , G M , Savelberg , H H , Biddle , S J & Kremers , S P 2013 , ' Interrupting long periods of sitting: Good STUFF ' , International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity , vol. 10 , no. 1 , 1 . https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/1479-5868-10-1\",\"year\":\"2013-01-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sedentary behavior; Physical activity; Sitting time reduction; Health promotion; Dissemination; BEHAVIOR-CHANGE INTERVENTIONS; LIPOPROTEIN-LIPASE ACTIVITY; PHYSICAL INACTIVITY; SEDENTARY TIME; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; POPULATION HEALTH; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; PHYSIOLOGY; PARADIGM; BREAKS\",\"subject\":\"Sedentary behavior; Physical activity; Sitting time reduction; Health promotion; Dissemination; BEHAVIOR-CHANGE INTERVENTIONS; LIPOPROTEIN-LIPASE ACTIVITY; PHYSICAL INACTIVITY; SEDENTARY TIME;  POPULATION HEALTH;  PHYSIOLOGY; PARADIGM; BREAKS\",\"authors\":\"Rutten, G.M.; Savelberg, H.H.; Biddle, S.

Superflab, Super Stuff pink wax and Paraffin wax bolus materials are used with 15MeV electron energy for dosimetric comparison. Additionally, 10 mm thick Super Stuff pink wax bolus and paraffin wax bolus materials were placed on the right eyelid of a patient. Using electron dose calculation algorithm and ion chamber measurements, dosimetric comparisons were made in the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Both for measured and calculated dose, values were acquired 3 times and averaged for each case. Resulting differences are expressed as percentage differences. Dose differences were obtained in measurements with and without using bolus at several locations of the solid phantom, performed by the Roos Ion chamber. Dosimetric differences of 7-7.5% for Superflab, 10-10.5% for paraffin bolus and 13-14% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus are obtained. Besides, when dosimetric comparisons are made in the treatment planning system for cases with and without bolus; Dose differences were calculated to be 2-2.5% for superflab silicon bolus, 3-3.5% for paraffin wax bolus and 5-6% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus. To increase skin dose in curved anatomical structures in radiotherapy, it is safe to use the paraffin wax bolus material in radiotherapy clinic, as an alternative to Superflab silicon bolus and Super Stuff pink wax bolus materials, due to its low cost and ease of conforming to body surface contours.\",\"published_in\":\"Volume: 16, Issue: 2 201-205 ; 1305-130X ; 1305-1385 ; Celal Bayar University Journal of Science\",\"year\":\"2020-06-24T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Radiotherapy,Superflab,Paraffin,Super Stuff\",\"subject\":\"Radiotherapy,Superflab,Paraffin,Super Stuff\",\"authors\":\"ARAS, Serhat; TANZER, \\u0130hsan Oguz; \\u0130K\\u0130ZCEL\\u0130, T\\u00fcrkan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/cbayarfbe\\/issue\\/55133\\/654782\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"aef90adac1fcf5749967853e586d7084350db74d0886d1d878de7727635d27ba\",\"relevance\":79,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"f64b456b8b6daa463441d399b7f4ccb97ac7db885ddf77a36ef73c4434edd7e2\",\"relation\":\"THE JOURNAL OF PEER PRODUCTION; issue 13; Hirscher , A-L & Maze , R 2019 , ' Stuff Matters in Participation: Infrastructuring a Co-Sewing Caf\\u00e9 ' THE JOURNAL OF PEER PRODUCTION , no. 13 .; 2213-5316; PURE UUID: c0c045ca-8a8d-48ba-a7c4-03b05c15dea0; PURE ITEMURL: https:\\/\\/research.aalto.fi\\/en\\/publications\\/stuff-matters-in-participation-infrastructuring-a-cosewing-cafe(c0c045ca-8a8d-48ba-a7c4-03b05c15dea0).html; PURE FILEURL: https:\\/\\/research.aalto.fi\\/files\\/35525145\\/Stuff_matters_in_participation_2.pdf; https:\\/\\/aaltodoc.aalto.fi\\/handle\\/123456789\\/39743; URN:NBN:fi:aalto-201908154788\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/aaltodoc.aalto.fi\\/handle\\/123456789\\/39743\",\"title\":\"Stuff Matters in Participation: Infrastructuring a Co-Sewing Caf\\u00e9\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper explores how acts of use and participation can be better understood and articulated in relation to the socio-material and spatial conditions of \\u201cinfrastructuring\\u201d.

Its products are also aiming to be viscerally equivalent in terms of their meatlike taste, texture, and overall sensory experience. These alternative proteins (APs) are not, however, intended merely as a substitute for conventional meat. Instead they are viewed and marketed by their developers as meat, made simply from a different raw material and via different methods. Yet as animal meat has become increasingly linked with environmental, health, and ethical concerns, Beyond Meat is having to negotiate a careful balance between positioning its products as meatlike in some respects and not meatlike in others in order to gain consumer adoption. To become \\u201cmeat\\u201d in consumer thinking not only depends on the things these APs are made of\\u2014both material and ideological\\u2014but also the things that are actively excluded; as such, their materiality is made of purposefully chosen \\u201cstuff\\u201d and \\u201cnon-stuff.\\u201d The article explores this decision-making via my fieldwork encounters with Beyond Meat's products. Using a visceral-autoethnographic approach, I discuss how certain (non)stuff was \\u201cmade to matter and not matter\\u201d (Evans and Miele 2012) to me during these encounters, and how this careful balancing of stuff can create new and problematic imaginaries, moral politics, and misguided understandings of what constitutes \\u201cbetter\\u201d foods and \\u201cbetter\\u201d eaters. The observations made contribute to existing discussions on visceral methodologies, perceptions of (novel) foods, embodied consumption practices, and the ways in which bodies are made as eaters and things as food.\",\"published_in\":\"Gastronomica ; volume 16, issue 3, page 66-78 ; ISSN 1529-3262 1533-8622\",\"year\":\"2016\",\"subject_orig\":\"General Medicine\",\"subject\":\"General Medicine\",\"authors\":\"Sexton, Alexandra\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/gfc.2016.16.3.66\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"4a77e92cfca91427a18127826aaf8b815538e9cda35fd14b38f273e5ed87c555\",\"relevance\":77,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/gfc.2016.16.3.66\"},{\"id\":\"d56b1d26da6da0f5ccbf3803f0d0667155c089b5f0f863b801150162cf5ae179\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/epubs.surrey.ac.uk\\/841131\\/; 10.1109\\/MTS.2016.2527078; Taylor, Emmeline and Michael, Katina (2016) Smart Toys that are the Stuff of Nightmares IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 35 (1). pp. 8-10.; doi:10.1109\\/MTS.2016.2527078\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1109\\/MTS.2016.2527078\",\"title\":\"Smart Toys that are the Stuff of Nightmares\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Hello Barbie tries to engage with children in intelligible and freeflowing conversation by asking and responding to questions, as well as being able to learn about its users over time [4).

Hence, the English contemporary political theatre has displayed unique interconnectedness between drama and politics: interest in US-Iraq war is indeed not an exception. British playwright, David Hare, belongs to a trend of war drama that enables the world to witness the truth, trauma and the violence of US-Iraq war. Stuff Happens subtly helps show how US coercive diplomacy manipulates other Powers to fulfill the new doctrine of \\\" New American Century.\\\" In Stuff Happens, Hare documents the recent tragic history of Iraq in such an approach that blends the documentary with the fictional to display the events from 2000, till the actual invasion of Iraq in April, 2003. The play traces the origins of US-Iraq war and unveils all the attempts and the procedures undertaken by Bush and his administration team to invade Iraq.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0627\\u062f\\u0627\\u0628 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0643\\u0640\\u0648\\u0641\\u0629; Vol 2, No 37 (2018): \\u0645\\u062c\\u0644\\u0629 \\u0627\\u062f\\u0627\\u0628 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0643\\u0648\\u0641\\u0629 ; 1994-8999\",\"year\":\"2018-11-28\",\"subject_orig\":\"Dramatic Responses to US-Iraq War: A Study in David Hare's Stuff Happens\",\"subject\":\"Dramatic Responses to US-Iraq War: A Study in David Hare's Stuff Happens\",\"authors\":\"Ghani, Hana Khaleif; Chellab, Mithal\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.uokufa.edu.iq\\/index.php\\/kufa_arts\\/article\\/view\\/7696\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"181a0dee28573750785430d02d62555376dbbf41641fbd65d2962a31c4cd3686\",\"relevance\":65,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"6604e4424f999f562b9f056ae1173a2d7fd21acf796047e1e4c094c06da93f43\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.1186\\/1479-5868-10-1; issn:1479-5868\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/espace.library.uq.edu.au\\/view\\/UQ:346454\",\"title\":\"Interrupting long periods of sitting: good STUFF\",\"paper_abstract\":\"There is increasing evidence that sedentary behaviour is in itself a health risk, regardless of the daily amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the \\\"Law of the few\\\", the \\\"Stickiness factor\\\", and the \\\"Power of context\\\". For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as \\\"interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks\\\", for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-01-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sedentary behavior; Physical activity; Sitting time reduction; Health promotion; Dissemination\",\"subject\":\"Sedentary behavior; Physical activity; Sitting time reduction; Health promotion; Dissemination\",\"authors\":\"Rutten, Geert M.; Savelberg, Hans H.; Biddle, Stuart J.

His reasons are persuasive. First, it provides a rich vein of initial stimulus material to tap, helping us to engage and intrigue even our least motivated learners. Second, it allows students to construct layers of meaning that might escape them purely through the written word. Students often find it easier to \\u2018read\\u2019 the tone of a source by listening to it and this can be a powerful way to consider perspective. Third, the use of this type of music supports close textual analysis, providing ways of exploring the lyrics at different levels. Finally, it helps us to pose rigorous historical questions about significance and interpretation. Enquiries that explore why people still sing about the Diggers and what impact Billie Holliday\\u2019s songs had on the Civil Rights movement provide students with both challenge and motivation.

It\\u2019s stuff nobody wants. Photographs they can classify or identify go upward in price . . . The stuff I get is twenty-five cents a shot. But I like that because I don\\u2019t want stills from movies that I\\u2019ve seen or when I\\u2019m familiar with the stars.

Benjamin argues that the production of an immaterial similarity is in some way an act of magic. But it is also at the same time an overcoming of magic itself. And the reason is that the \\u201cimmaterial similarity\\u201d can open the way to a \\u201cmaterialistic perspective\\u201d. How can that be? In order to answer, we\\u2019ll consider Benjamin\\u2019s idea of \\u201cmatter\\u201d. In Benjamin\\u2019s early writings matter (Materie) appears, as we shall see, as something magic. But there is another idea, which is quite near to matter but is not exactly the same: the idea of \\u201cstuff\\u201d (Stoff). The stuff is the \\u201cmaterial\\u201d things are made of. If we search for a definition of it, we can find that it is \\u201cthe mute, soft and flocky element that \\u2013 like the snow in the snow globes \\u2013 clouds over inside the core of things\\u201d.

Whilst dance is known as a feminine activity, males tend to be even more in the minority in more \\u2018feminised\\u2019 genres, such as ballet. However, in other genres, such as street dance, which allows them to conform to a more traditionally masculine identity, they are in the majority. Regardless of genre, however, males are more often found in positions of power within the dance-performer\\u2019s world compared to their female counterparts. Dance teachers clearly have an important role to play in dance students\\u2019 perceptions of gendered (in)equalities within the dance world, where the majority of dance teachers are female. To date, however, their perceptions have been under-researched. To address this research gap, 10 female professional dance teachers, ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, were interviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis through the theoretical lens of symbolic interactionism. Two salient themes were identified: coolness and masculinity, and male privilege. Participants perceived that gender inequalities did exist within dance genres and in the opportunities afforded to male and female dancers. These inequalities appeared to lead to a greater valorisation of male dancers in terms of physical and psychological characteristics. The perceptions of female dance teachers in general are important in relation to the socialisation of future dance professionals.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2016-09-24\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Clegg, Helen; Owton, Helen; Allen-Collinson, Jacquelyn\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nectar.northampton.ac.uk\\/11752\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"04fdcf8f93f1ba4d3fc9ba985780b98898907e6011ee3f31579b59253b7b3310\",\"relevance\":57,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"5084f5c95bc9a9cf3c8cccb4da70dd34f7d5cf3a9239bfc29dc0fdd31f01db7f\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.unp.ac.id\\/index.php\\/voteknika\\/article\\/view\\/3275\\/2705\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.unp.ac.id\\/index.php\\/voteknika\\/article\\/view\\/3275\",\"title\":\"PERANCANGAN SISTEM INFORMASI MANAJEMEN ASET DAN INVENTARIS SMK N 7 PADANG\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Processing of asset management and inventarize at SMKN 7 Padang running manually such as inventarize of new stuff to be record through ledger by hand.

In general, film genres help us understand the world. More specifically, the Hollywood Western is the film\\u2019s point of departure for its depiction of the astronaut\\u2019s immediate predecessor \\u2013 the test pilot; yet it is the family melodrama and the comedy that should be acknowledged as more important for understanding the astronaut as the test pilot\\u2019s successor.

In this article we discuss extensions of Ostroms approach to human genes and genomes and explore its limits and usefulness in this field. We argue that while there are radically different contexts and cases and governance regimes still to be debated, what we call 'genomic stuff' genomic material, data, and information often can best be regulated by modes of stewardship and self-regulation of appropriators. We exemplify this claim by a discussion of gene patenting, the 'Genome War', and the so-called HapMap project. The issue of how to best govern the genomic stuff of humans, we suggest, is complicated by the situation that the appropriator and the appropriated can be the same, inviting fundamental questions about politics and ethics.\\\"\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2011\",\"subject_orig\":\"global commons; Ostrom; Elinor; governance and politics; Social Organization\",\"subject\":\"global commons; Ostrom; Elinor; governance and politics; Social Organization\",\"authors\":\"P??lsson, G??sli; Prainsack, Barbara\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10535\\/7548\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e0d5eae857ae4581457ef85b6de3c776f2f17f71e69a30042397e60d40eb40ff\",\"relevance\":49,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\",\"Report\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"deea58347a54e79f18b00a4b25e62fbdfd51f0814ddcde3c32552deb235be96c\",\"relation\":\"Lucas, U. , Cox, P. , Croudace, C. and Milford, P.

Several solutions have been proposed so far for dealing with stuff bits in the payload of messages, but they are not effective for the cyclic redundancy check. In this paper, a mechanism is presented that prevents the occurrence of stuff bits in the whole frame completely. It makes the duration of frame transmissions fixed and, hence, it achieves very accurate reception times. An optimized codec has been implemented to demonstrate that this approach is feasible and can be profitably adopted in low-cost networked embedded systems with demanding timing constraints.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2015\",\"subject_orig\":\"Controller area network (CAN); industrial control; real-time distributed systems\",\"subject\":\"Controller area network (CAN); industrial control; real-time distributed systems\",\"authors\":\"Cena, Gianluca; Cibrario Bertolotti, Ivan; Hu, Tingting; Valenzano, Adriano\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11583\\/2572569\",\"oa_state\":\"0\",\"url\":\"d0cc65027f49ddf1e042a435ed35df3c11960ee19706e8e862a09696d2cb5303\",\"relevance\":41,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2966f32135745ebb64ddb8c8b77e4bbd9a821323add23fc7b9686e3704e1bb1d\",\"relation\":\"Michael, Mike <http:\\/\\/research.gold.ac.uk\\/view\\/goldsmiths\\/Michael=3AMike=3A=3A.html>. 2003.

Exotic technologies - iconically information and communication technologies and biotechnologies - typically evoke change and the novel character of the present epoch. Yet these enter a world of mundane technologies that putatively serve merely in social reproduction. It is argued that such a stark contrast is untenable. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres, the temporality of technology is re-conceived in terms of patterns of order\\/disorder to which both exotic and mundane technologies contribute. The minimal parameters needed to articulate the nature of such a complexly temporalized sociotechnical stuff are outlined.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2003\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Michael, Mike\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/research.gold.ac.uk\\/2480\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"2966f32135745ebb64ddb8c8b77e4bbd9a821323add23fc7b9686e3704e1bb1d\",\"relevance\":40,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"ffd46341710883cb2e73acb040fb98fad3c14c02cd05ca6fcd6f307e296b4ee3\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.lib.vntu.edu.ua\\/handle\\/123456789\\/12301\",\"title\":\"\\u0421\\u043f\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u0435\\u0440\\u0456\\u0433\\u0430\\u0447 \\u0433\\u0430\\u0440\\u043c\\u043e\\u043d\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0441\\u043a\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434\\u0443 \\u0442\\u0440\\u0438\\u0444\\u0430\\u0437\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0441\\u0442\\u0440\\u0443\\u043c\\u0443 \\u0434\\u043b\\u044f \\u043f\\u0430\\u0440\\u0430\\u043b\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0430\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0444\\u0456\\u043b\\u044c\\u0442\\u0440\\u0456\\u0432 ;

Consequently, the multistage escape system and separate component such as small self-rescuers, reswitching points, life-safety for fixed and portable refuge chambers, emergency alarm system are established. ; SeriesInformation ; \\u21162-2017 (2018)\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u0441\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u0441\\u043f\\u0430\\u0441\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c; \\u043f\\u0443\\u043d\\u043a\\u0442\\u044b \\u043f\\u0435\\u0440\\u0435\\u043a\\u043b\\u044e\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f; \\u0441\\u0440\\u0435\\u0434\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0430 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u0437\\u0430\\u0449\\u0438\\u0442\\u044b; \\u044d\\u0432\\u0430\\u043a\\u0443\\u0430\\u0446\\u0438\\u044f \\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u043d\\u043e\\u0440\\u0430\\u0431\\u043e\\u0447\\u0438\\u0445; \\u0441\\u0438\\u0441\\u0442\\u0435\\u043c\\u044b \\u0416\\u0438\\u0437\\u043d\\u0435\\u043e\\u0431\\u0435\\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f; SELF-RESCUER; RESWITCHING POINT; COLLECTIVE PROTECTIVE MEANS; MINE STUFF EVACUATION; LIFE-SAFETY SYSTEM\",\"subject\":\"\\u0441\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u0441\\u043f\\u0430\\u0441\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c; \\u043f\\u0443\\u043d\\u043a\\u0442\\u044b \\u043f\\u0435\\u0440\\u0435\\u043a\\u043b\\u044e\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f; \\u0441\\u0440\\u0435\\u0434\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0430 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u0437\\u0430\\u0449\\u0438\\u0442\\u044b; \\u044d\\u0432\\u0430\\u043a\\u0443\\u0430\\u0446\\u0438\\u044f \\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u043d\\u043e\\u0440\\u0430\\u0431\\u043e\\u0447\\u0438\\u0445; \\u0441\\u0438\\u0441\\u0442\\u0435\\u043c\\u044b \\u0416\\u0438\\u0437\\u043d\\u0435\\u043e\\u0431\\u0435\\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f;  RESWITCHING POINT; COLLECTIVE PROTECTIVE MEANS; MINE STUFF EVACUATION; LIFE-SAFETY SYSTEM\",\"authors\":\"\\u041f\\u0410\\u0428\\u041a\\u041e\\u0412\\u0421\\u041a\\u0418\\u0419 \\u041f.\\u0421.; \\u041f\\u041b\\u0415\\u0422\\u0415\\u041d\\u0415\\u0426\\u041a\\u0418\\u0419 \\u0420.\\u0421.; \\u0413\\u041e\\u0412\\u0416\\u0415\\u0415\\u0412 \\u0412.\\u0412.; \\u0417\\u0411\\u041e\\u0420\\u0429\\u0418\\u041a \\u041b.\\u0410.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25558\\/VOSTNII.2017.2-2017.12442\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"208f42f73b9cda6c59e63c7c6c2113ecab93f6e9503dcc6f58451636c4984081\",\"relevance\":37,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25558\\/VOSTNII.2017.2-2017.12442\"},{\"id\":\"dab185cecf7d1363e08ef0e4bfa481d0f7bb27c4c1bc66b2912edc846c3034d6\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/ajol.info\\/index.php\\/pp\\/article\\/view\\/29539\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ajol.info\\/index.php\\/pp\\/article\\/view\\/29539\",\"title\":\"The Thesis of Vague Objects and Unger's Problem of the Many\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Peter Unger argues that his puzzle of the problem of the many leaves us with having to accept either countless embedded objects of the same kind or a Parmenidean rejection of distinct entities. This dilemma can be avoided if objects truly have vague boundaries. It is metaphysically impossible for an entity with a vague boundary to be embedded within an entity of the same kind. A cloud's parts (that is, cloud stuff) cannot be clearly embedded within the vague boundary region of another cloud, for the latter region is defined as possessing neither cloud-stuff nor non-cloud-stuff. Likewise, there cannot be a cloud with a vague boundary embedded in the middle of another cloud because there would then have to be a population of water droplets dense enough to compose part of the larger cloud which was nevertheless insufficient in density to compose part of the embedded cloud.\",\"published_in\":\"Philosophical Papers; Vol 30, No 1 (2001); 57-67\",\"year\":\"2006-10-25\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"David B.

Characterized as a kind of intermediate stuff, the apeiron turns out to consist of contraries and as such is impossible. Commentators have rightly noted this point and some have also indicated that Aristotle offers an argument of sorts for his negative estimate. However, the argument has received scant attention, and it is fair to say that it remains unclear exactly why Aristotle rejects Anaximander\\u2019s intermediate stuff. Indeed, it is unclear how Aristotle\\u2019s argument is supposed to run in the first place. This paper offers a reconstruction of Aristotle\\u2019s argument for the impossibility of the apeiron , and on this basis offers to explain Aristotle\\u2019s grounds for rejecting Anaximander\\u2019s intermediate stuff. This is especially called for in light of the fact that Aristotle himself thinks that there can be intermediate stuffs. Finally, some attention is given to the parallel between the apeiron and Aristotle\\u2019s prime matter.\",\"published_in\":\"Phronesis ; volume 58, issue 1, page 17-31 ; ISSN 0031-8868 1568-5284\",\"year\":\"2013\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wedin, Michael\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/15685284-12341240\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"c8607d0d25ec1497568b6e3223b56630bfe7fb541c472cb6104fef80209f7a98\",\"relevance\":34,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/15685284-12341240\"},{\"id\":\"7dab8299a61028c145c339e0d5a5dc07dbf6f80eb3830a2f725edfa2a8bb06ee\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/jrnl.nau.edu.ua\\/index.php\\/visnik\\/article\\/view\\/1457; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1813-1166; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2306-1472; 1813-1166; 2306-1472; doi:10.18372\\/2306-1472.31.1457; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/8bbf43c05f6843309969b887a812dec7\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.18372\\/2306-1472.31.1457; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/8bbf43c05f6843309969b887a812dec7\",\"title\":\"Analytical performance evaluation elektroochistiteley with a fibrous filler dielectric\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The falling out process of particles of the contamination is \\u0441onsidered on surfaces of the filaments polarized stuff under the action of external electric field.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the 'Law of the few' , the 'Stickiness factor' , and the 'Power of context'. For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as 'interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks' , for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2013-01-02\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Rutten, Geert M.; Savelberg, Hans H.; Biddle, Stuart J.

As a National Science Foundation funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, it is part of PCCM\\u2019s mission to inspire and educate school children, teachers and the public about STEM and materials science. Research shows that it is critical to excite students at a young age and maintain that excitement, and without that these, students are two to three times less likely to have any interest in science and engineering and pursue science careers as adults. The Making Stuff TV series offered a great teachable moment in materials science for students and teachers alike. The four episodes, Stronger, Smaller, Smarter and Cleaner aired in January and February, 2011. Our complementary education program helped promote the viewership of the Making Stuff series in the region, and the NOVA episodes helped us by priming the teachers and students to learn more about materials science research conducted at Princeton University. The Making Stuff coalition events we conducted were designed to have the maximum positive impact on students\\u2019 attitudes towards science and scientists, in general, and materials scientists and engineers, specifically. Each and every student had an opportunity to interact with dozens of scientists and engineers, in the lab, at table demonstrations and lecture presentations. As an ongoing MRSEC education and outreach program we have developed many successful educational partnerships to increase our impact. Plus, through years of successful education programs and the participation of our materials scientists and engineers, we have cultivated great trust in the schools and local community. The schools eagerly joined as partners in the program to bring their students to the event. Teachers from those partner schools actively participated in associated professional development programs conducted by education staff and PCCM professors before and after the big event. Included were presentations by MRSEC members and the partners from Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials (PRISM), Princeton University\\u2019s chemistry department, DOE funded centers PP-SOC and PPPL, Liberty Science Center, Franklin Institute, our PBS partner NJN and our many school district partners.\",\"published_in\":\"MRS Proceedings ; volume 1364 ; ISSN 0272-9172 1946-4274\",\"year\":\"2011\",\"subject_orig\":\"Mechanical Engineering; General Materials Science; Mechanics of Materials; Condensed Matter Physics\",\"subject\":\"Mechanical Engineering; General Materials Science; Mechanics of Materials; Condensed Matter Physics\",\"authors\":\"Steinberg, Daniel J.; Greco, Shannon\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1557\\/opl.2011.1176\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1d274e7ade6b007aac2fb7737ff6d554fec29fefa63d7819fbe5fb44f825b6e5\",\"relevance\":26,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1557\\/opl.2011.1176\"},{\"id\":\"4e358d95dd24028ee6d7820891e428f970b11a923a99a27608fc19b9b320e967\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.1093\\/bjps\\/axv026; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/pissn\\/0007-0882; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/pissn\\/1464-3537; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/urn\\/urn:nbn:ch:serval-BIB_6F7362001A3A4; https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/notice\\/serval:BIB_6F7362001A3A; doi:10.1093\\/bjps\\/axv026; https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/resource\\/serval:BIB_6F7362001A3A.P001\\/REF.pdf; http:\\/\\/nbn-resolving.org\\/urn\\/resolver.pl?urn=urn:nbn:ch:serval-BIB_6F7362001A3A4\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/notice\\/serval:BIB_6F7362001A3A; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/bjps\\/axv026; https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/resource\\/serval:BIB_6F7362001A3A.P001\\/REF.pdf; http:\\/\\/nbn-resolving.org\\/urn\\/resolver.pl?urn=urn:nbn:ch:serval-BIB_6F7362001A3A4\",\"title\":\"The Physics and Metaphysics of Primitive Stuff\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The article sets out a primitive ontology of the natural world in terms of primitive stuff\\u2014that is, stuff that has as such no physical properties at all\\u2014but that is not a bare substratum either, being individuated by metrical relations.

We show that such properties can be local (classical mechanics), as well as holistic (quantum mechanics), and discuss two metaphysical options to conceive them, namely, Humeanism and modal realism in the guise of dispositionalism.\",\"published_in\":\"The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, vol. 68, no. 1, pp. 133-161\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"primitive ontology; primitive stuff; ontic structural realism; identical particles; Bohmian mechanics; Humeanism; modal realism; dispositionalism\",\"subject\":\"primitive ontology; primitive stuff; ontic structural realism; identical particles; Bohmian mechanics; Humeanism; modal realism; dispositionalism\",\"authors\":\"Esfeld, Michael; Lazarovici, Dustin; Lam, Vincent; Hubert, Mario\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/notice\\/serval:BIB_6F7362001A3A\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"4e358d95dd24028ee6d7820891e428f970b11a923a99a27608fc19b9b320e967\",\"relevance\":25,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"4c5208085cf295e90df2d0367f8816d616fcaf4b7c712cf7099fd93995c28496\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/411948; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/pausbed\\/issue\\/34756\\/384430\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/pausbed\\/issue\\/34756\\/384430\",\"title\":\"Reklam ve Tan\\u0131t\\u0131m ile Yurtd\\u0131\\u015f\\u0131 Sat\\u0131\\u015flar Aras\\u0131ndaki \\u0130li\\u015fki: B\\u0130ST\\u2019te \\u0130\\u015flem G\\u00f6ren G\\u0131da Firmalar\\u0131 \\u00dczerinde Uygulama ; The Relationship between Marketing and Export Sales: On The Food Stuff Industry Companies Quoted in BIST\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Bu \\u00e7al\\u0131\\u015fmada firmalar\\u0131n reklam ve tan\\u0131t\\u0131m harcamalar\\u0131 ile yurtd\\u0131\\u015f\\u0131 sat\\u0131\\u015flar aras\\u0131ndaki ili\\u015fkinin incelenmesi ama\\u00e7lanm\\u0131\\u015ft\\u0131r.

When it comes to practical attempts to operationalise sustainable development, however, the social stuff is often neglected. In this paper, we provide a detailed exploration of how the concept of social sustainability is operationalised (and therefore understood) within the aquaculture certification context. We found that a) certification schemes do address social sustainability, but relevant indicators mostly focus on workers rights, or link directly back to environmental sustainability (through the consequences of environmental impact on humans); and b) the actions required often add little over and above existing legal requirements. Essentially, aquaculture sustainability certification schemes have not (yet) taken the opportunity to further shape our understanding of what social sustainability means, or how it is practiced. The consequence of this may be the impression that industries are truly sustainable, just because they have obtained sustainability certification.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Human Society; Sociology; Environmental sociology\",\"subject\":\"Human Society; Sociology; Environmental sociology\",\"authors\":\"Alexander, KA; Amundsen, VS; Osmundsen, TC\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.envsci.2020.06.003\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"5ff4483d8292375dfdc114660990f945719b3a110586330e9158b698d9f069b6\",\"relevance\":19,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.envsci.2020.06.003\"},{\"id\":\"615ad100d5ff131f42d9004383ea88252e1f5a4612c6ead5beec7d78a7b0996c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.neuroquantology.com\\/index.php\\/journal\\/article\\/view\\/49\\/49\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.neuroquantology.com\\/index.php\\/journal\\/article\\/view\\/49; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14704\\/nq.2004.2.3.49\",\"title\":\"Emergence and Organization Towards a Taxonomy of Organizing Relations\",\"paper_abstract\":\"There are effectively two classes of explanations for how we come to be conscious, particularly in the sense of having a \\u201cmental world\\u201d or apprehending and comprehending phenomenal experience of both the material world in which we are present, and the worlds of our imagination.

He also has the concept of a material cause, that is, the raw materials out of which something can be made or generated, and he makes frequent use of this concept in his analysis of perceptible substances. Still, the fact that Aristotle thought about what perceptible substances are made of is insufficient evidence for attributing to him the concept of matter as physical stuff. In addition, we would want to know whether he thought that all perceptible substances are extended, movable, and corporeal precisely because they are made out of matter, and whether any aspect of their behavior is to be explained simply by virtue of their nature as material objects.\",\"published_in\":\"Canadian Journal of Philosophy ; volume 31, issue 1, page 85-111 ; ISSN 0045-5091 1911-0820\",\"year\":\"2001\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophy\",\"subject\":\"Philosophy\",\"authors\":\"Byrne, Christopher\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1080\\/00455091.2001.10717561\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"ccba9fc7c0cc2e94d17a83e5d794697d358236da9c4501a34aca3e19f07dccf4\",\"relevance\":15,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1080\\/00455091.2001.10717561\"},{\"id\":\"8619c9ecd48fb4a5f2f9c14da49a4febc724e5dfbf4abedd523f3b82762c0b98\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/kclpure.kcl.ac.uk\\/portal\\/en\\/publications\\/i-dont-get-this-climate-stuff(9a37951a-fe7f-4dae-8b82-2b54790b6a2c).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0963662514565332; http:\\/\\/www.scopus.com\\/inward\\/record.url?scp=84943243799&partnerID=8YFLogxK\",\"title\":\"\\u2018I don\\u2019t get this climate stuff!\\u2019:Making sense of climate change among the corporate middle class in Lagos\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Public engagement continues to be central to wider efforts to address climate change.

At the 2001 Irish Times\\/ESB Theatre Awards, a member of the judging panel lamented the scarcity of new Irish plays, stating that he wanted to describe 2001 as a good year for Irish theatre \\u2013 but couldn\\u2019t. Media reports on Irish theatre enhance this sense of gloom: the Abbey has lurched from controversy over its production of Barbaric Comedies to criticism of its proposal to relocate to Dublin\\u2019s docklands; the Gate has publicly disagreed with the Arts Council over its funding; and despite its international success, Galway audiences are reportedly frustrated by what they perceive to be Druid Theatre\\u2019s irrelevance to them. What makes this apparent negativity difficult to understand is that, as recently as 1999, many commentators were declaring that Irish theatre had entered a new golden age, and that a second renaissance had been signaled by the emergence of plays like The Steward of Christendom, Portia Coughlan, and The Weir. As reports of the demise of the Celtic Tiger illustrate, this sudden shift from celebration to despondency is not exclusive to commentary on Irish theatre \\u2013 and perhaps what is most evident in such reports is the Irish media\\u2019s tendency to exaggerate. The value of Theatre Stuff, an excellent collection of essays from Carysfort Press, is that it brings clear-headed analysis to a debate that has hitherto been dominated by marketing and excessively exuberant journalism. ; non-peer-reviewed\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2017-06-21T14:20:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Irish theatre; Drama; Theatre studies\",\"subject\":\"Irish theatre; Drama; Theatre studies\",\"authors\":\"Lonergan, Patrick\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10379\\/6645\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1be21617132658d48ebecdcd2682095037d9915eee80e2761630baf38f46c7e7\",\"relevance\":10,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"7217fcb6bf05db7c61e69d3083b4d4b5ab1ed22cee1df198511656c7fd742220\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.3992\\/jgb.10.2.198\",\"title\":\"APPLICATION OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO VARIOUS BUILDING LIFETIME SHEARING LAYERS: SITE, STRUCTURE, SKIN, SERVICES, SPACE, AND STUFF\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Currently, green rating systems are not directly related to environmental consequences. Moreover, rating systems score both building-related tasks with long lifetime expectancies and system-related tasks with short lifetime expectancies without separating them. Therefore, passive solar and bio-climatic architectures, which have long lifetime expectancies and thus have a strong, negative impact on the environment, are neglected. The main goal of this study is to explore differences in total environmental impact for a single \\u201ctypical\\u201d building module (with the heavy wall building technology accepted in Israel) in terms of six different lifetime shearing layers, Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff, each of which reflects a different form of environmental damage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the six shearing layers using life cycle assessment (LCA) by applying Eco-indicator 99 (EI99). It was found that the environmental damage associated with the Building layers (Site, Structure, and Skin) was higher than that associated with the Service layers (Services, Space Plan, and Stuff). The paper may contribute to the development of a more scientific (quantitative) background for green rating systems. As a result, a greater decrease in building-related ecological impacts can be achieved, thus encouraging sustainable building activities.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Green Building ; volume 10, issue 2, page 198-214 ; ISSN 1943-4618 1552-6100\",\"year\":\"2015\",\"subject_orig\":\"Geography, Planning and Development; General Environmental Science\",\"subject\":\"Geography, Planning and Development; General Environmental Science\",\"authors\":\"Pushkar, Svetlana\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.3992\\/jgb.10.2.198\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"7217fcb6bf05db7c61e69d3083b4d4b5ab1ed22cee1df198511656c7fd742220\",\"relevance\":9,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.3992\\/jgb.10.2.198\"},{\"id\":\"94aba25755c296cfff57e3f19911662b5b1f0aeb2070769ca89eede9001732eb\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0266078419000312; https:\\/\\/www.cambridge.org\\/core\\/services\\/aop-cambridge-core\\/content\\/view\\/S0266078419000312\",\"title\":\"The English general extender ; The forms and functions of a new linguistic category, or something, and stuff\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English (Biber et al., 1999), a new category is identified in the grammar of the English phrase.

As imaginative engagements with this supposed esoteric coterie (a group allegedly comprised of Marlowe, Ralegh, Hariot, Chapman, and other Elizabethan notables) in contemporary novels are frequently linked with fictionalisations of research activity and academic enquiry, this article first traces the contours of the School\\u2019s rise and fall in\\u2014as well as its spectral haunting of\\u2014real-life, twentieth-century scholarship before shifting focus to Alan Wall\\u2019s School of Night (2001), Louis Bayard\\u2019s The School of Night (2011) and Deborah Harkness\\u2019s Shadow of Night (2012). I argue that these three recent academic novels share far more than their near-identical titles, for in them, we find a consistent constellation of the supposed Elizabethan group with concerns of factuality, authority and legitimacy. Furthermore, in all of these novels, the payoff of bringing a fictive researcher into contact with the School of Night is ultimately the same: it provides a platform for reimagining of the nexus of historical and intertextual relationships surrounding Marlowe and Shakespeare. ;

The aim of this study was to investigate the current expectations and needs of veterinary clients across a range of practice types. Interviews and focus groups were undertaken with veterinary clients to identify the capabilities of veterinarians that result in the best client experience, generating a \\u2018Veterinary Capability Framework\\u2019. This comprised six main capabilities each containing 4\\u201310 behavioural indicators: client relationships; professionalism; communication skills; decision-making and problem solving; commitment to animal welfare; and commitment to quality and the profession.

This survey dwells on the problem of the actual Romanian food-stuff consumption, from the perspective of its structural internal conditions, between 1990 and 2004. One aspect of the study of the food-stuff consumption refers to the situation of the average yearly consumption\\/inhabitant, in Romania, refers to food-stuff produces and beverages. Another aspect of this study refers to the average daily food-stuff consumption\\/inhabitant, showed in calories and nutritive factors. This indicator is a key-variable in quantifying the regional and global food-stuff consumption. In fact, it is the expression of the national average apparently food-stuff consumption. Of high importance for estimating the development level of a society and especially the life standard of its population are the costs for the food-stuff produces. Otherwise, it is about the percentage from the income that is assigned for food-stuff produces expenses. The expenses dynamic for food-stuff produces and beverages are constantly observed, in all modern countries.

This article explores current thinking about policy learning and transfer, using recent work on the 'Americanisation' of UK active labour market policies as a focus of discussion. While it is clear that the UK has learned from the US in certain respects, academic debates about the US-UK policy relationship are marked by accounts of learning and transfer that depend on a highly rational interpretation of these processes. The article reviews current debates in the policy transfer literature and applies a critical view of policy learning and transfer to key accounts of labour market activation policies before moving on to consider how useful the concept of policy transfer really is in an increasingly complex, plural and 'de-institutionalising' world.

Capillary marketing is one of the most influential techniques in the issue of more sales in organizations especially in terms of selling food stuff. Food stuff should be sold in a short time due to the short durability. People who make better use of capillary marketing to supply their products and services can sell better and faster. Dependency of Iran's economy on oil incomes and affectability of such incomes from political, economic and international issues cause vulnerability and fragility of the economy. One of the ways of coping with this situation is developing new products that improves inland economic condition and causes an increase in non oil exports. Meanwhile, in addition to the role of food stuff in inland economic development, it can have a determining role in non oil export. Most of the families don't have financial ability to respond steamy needs of their children. Such children are just happy with watching colorful food and being influenced by messages they don't tend to traditional food. In fact, advertisements tell children what to wear play and eat.

The film first uses the Hollywood Western, as has been acknowledged by several authors. However, the film also uses other genres, particularly melodrama and comedy as described by Stanley Cavell. In general, film genres help us understand the world. More specifically, the Hollywood Western is the film\\u2019s point of departure for its depiction of the astronaut\\u2019s immediate predecessor \\u2013 the test pilot; yet it is the family melodrama and the comedy that should be acknowledged as more important for understanding the astronaut as the test pilot\\u2019s successor. To be precise, understanding the history of space travel in terms of Hollywood genres requires an examination of the way in which THE RIGHT STUFF has marked the transition from a covert, military operation (test pilots) to a civilian public relations project (astronauts) as the succession of the Western by the family melodrama and the comedy of remarriage. comedy of remarriage; film genre; space travel; melodrama; Western; Filmgenre; Raumfahrt; Melodram; ddc:791; THE RIGHT STUFF Staat, Wim (2016): THE RIGHT STUFF: From Western to melodrama and comedy.

We construct mental representations of the world\\u2014particular configurations of our internal brain stuff\\u2014to guide our actions. But our brains contain only a minuscule part of the world\\u2019s stuff. Given the limited brain stuff available, we can have detailed representations of some features of the world only if we simplify our representations of other parts. Our internal representational means are thus too meager to accurately represent reality in full. Which representations we adopt will therefore depend upon our purposes: different purposes, different representations, different beliefs. Such a relativism does not deny the reality of the outside world, is not self-contradictory, and allows for progress, moral persuasion, and cross-cultural criticism.

Capillary marketing is one of the most influential techniques in the issue of more sales in organizations especially in terms of selling food stuff. Food stuff should be sold in a short time due to the short durability. People who make better use of capillary marketing to supply their products and services can sell better and faster. Dependency of Iran's economy on oil incomes and affectability of such incomes from political, economic and international issues cause vulnerability and fragility of the economy. One of the ways of coping with this situation is developing new products that improves inland economic condition and causes an increase in non oil exports. Meanwhile, in addition to the role of food stuff in inland economic development, it can have a determining role in non oil export. Most of the families don't have financial ability to respond steamy needs of their children. Such children are just happy with watching colorful food and being influenced by messages they don't tend to traditional food. In fact, advertisements tell children what to wear play and eat. In this study we are going to discuss marketing of children's food stuff and its advertising methods in Iran.

Although MNEs in Ghana engaged in both union suppression andunion substitution strategies, they appear to particularly favour the adoption of\\u2018union suppression\\u2019 strategies and what might be termed as \\u2018corridor tactics\\u2019. Our article highlights four transitional issues underpinning the emerging success of \\u2018corridortactics\\u2019 in union suppression in a less developed host country.

Previous research (Cheshire 2007; Tagliamonte & Denis 2010; Pichler & Levey 2011) finds suggestive evidence that and stuff and other GEs have undergone grammaticalization over their development. However, when viewed in apparent time, there is little evidence of ongoing grammaticalization; rather only vestiges of apparent previous grammaticalization remain. This paper takes up Pichler and Levey\\u2019s (2011) call for an appropriate real-time benchmark of comparison to enable a more thorough understanding of the historical development of these features. A collection of oral histories recorded in the 1970s and 1980s with elderly residents of three communities in southern Ontario, Canada, is used as a proxy for comparison to Tagliamonte and Denis\\u2019s (2010) analysis of the Toronto English Archive. By tracking the development of and stuff over more than a century of apparent time, this paper finds three changes in progress: (1) a lexical replacement such that and stuff becomes the majority variant in the variable system; (2) a morphological clipping process such that longer GEs such as and stuff like that lose the comparative element like that; and (3) the semantic bleaching of the set-marking meaning of and stuff. While this last change is a necessary part of grammaticalization, in the absence of phonetic reduction, decategorialization, and pragmatic shift, it is not sufficient evidence according to grammaticalization theory (e.g., Heine 2003; Traugott 2003; Diewald 2010).

The wastewater can be characterized as a highly variable, highly colored wastewater. A biological wastewater treatment plant uses a natural biological process-metabolism, to destroy waste organic matter. The most important parameter in the Arthur Operation Strategy is \\u201dtreatment time\\u201d. The main purpose of this research is to evaluate the treatability-toxicity of the dye stuff and paper wastewater by using the Arthur Instrument. This work points out that changes in degrees of treatability, due to changes in substance of samples, were shown by developing reaction rate and oxygen volume consumption graphs. These graphs were developed from the data obtained from a series of tests at various samples to activated sludge. In this research the important point was that the toxins were tested using the mixed liquor from dye stuff and paper industry giving us a direct indication of the toxic effect and an actual measurement of the treatment time. Based entirety on biological measurements, we have an actual message of the length of time it takes for the microbes in dye stuff and paper industry to treat the waste coming into aeration basin. Finally, this paper shows that the best treatment process for dye stuff and paper industry is two-stage activated carbon sludge process. \\u751f\\u7269\\u8655\\u7406; Arthur\\u5100\\u5668; \\u6d3b\\u6027\\u78b3\\u6ce5; \\u8655\\u7406\\u505c\\u7559\\u6642\\u9593; \\u56de\\u6536\\u518d\\u5229\\u7528; Arthur Instrument; Reaction Rate; Microbe; Biodegradable; Activated Carbon Sludge; Treatment Time; Dye Stuff  \\u937e\\u5ef6\\u6625; \\u8a31\\u5609\\u5f70; \\u738b\\u4fe1\\u6613\"},{\"id\":\"47351f8f6c34bd2a517dfc0daf9631022f3b805cf404328932e67da364777f46\",\"content\":\"David Hares stuff happens a dramatic journey of American war on Iraq The war launched by America and its allies against the country of Iraq on 2003 was a debatable and notorious war for the public opinion was shocked with the realization that the reasons for launching the war under the title \\u2018Iraq\\u2019s Mass Destruction Weapons\\u2019 were false. The tragic consequences of this war led many writers around the world to question the policy of the United States and its manipulation of facts to justify their narratives. The present study examines the American policy of invading Iraq in David Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens. It investigates Hare\\u2019s technique of combining documentary realism with imaginative reconstruction of the arguments to dramatize the American Invasion of Iraq. Stuff Happens is a historical and political play written as a verbatim theatre. It depicts the backroom deals and political maneuvers of the Bush administration in justifying their campaign against the \\u2018Axis of Evil\\u2019 culminated by the war against Iraq. The verbatim theatre is the best way of showing the gap between \\u2018what is said and what is seen to be done\\u2019. Scenes of direct speeches by real characters are part of this theatre dramatized to present a new reading of a historical event. In addition, characterization is used by Hare\\u2019s to chronicle the American war on Iraq. The study follows a postcolonial framework. The study concludes that Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens succeeded in shaking the public opinion with the truth that Bush\\u2019s administration has manipulated facts in order to achieve their colonial and imperial interests in Iraq, which led to more destruction and violence in this country.

Its products are also aiming to be viscerally equivalent in terms of their meatlike taste, texture, and overall sensory experience. These alternative proteins (APs) are not, however, intended merely as a substitute for conventional meat. Instead they are viewed and marketed by their developers as meat, made simply from a different raw material and via different methods. Yet as animal meat has become increasingly linked with environmental, health, and ethical concerns, Beyond Meat is having to negotiate a careful balance between positioning its products as meatlike in some respects and not meatlike in others in order to gain consumer adoption. To become \\u201cmeat\\u201d in consumer thinking not only depends on the things these APs are made of\\u2014both material and ideological\\u2014but also the things that are actively excluded; as such, their materiality is made of purposefully chosen \\u201cstuff\\u201d and \\u201cnon-stuff.\\u201d The article explores this decision making via my fieldwork encounters with Beyond Meat\\u2019s products. Using a visceral-autoethnographic approach, I discuss how certain (non)stuff was \\u201cmade to matter and not matter\\u201d (Evans and Miele 2012) to me during these encounters, and how this careful balancing of stuff can create new and problematic imaginaries, moral politics, and misguided understandings of what constitutes \\u201cbetter\\u201d foods and \\u201cbetter\\u201d eaters. The observations made contribute to existing discussions on visceral methodologies, perceptions of (novel) foods, embodied consumption practices, and the ways in which bodies are made as eaters and things as food.

In those formative years of aviation and jet development, designers and pilots did not have the same design understanding and knowledge that we have today. In addition, they did not have the same understanding and knowledge of Systems Safety engineering and Human Factors expertise that we have today. Manned suborbital flights of today should be undertaken in vehicles that have been designed effectively with appropriately derived safety requirements including fault-tolerance, safe life and design-for-minimum risk approaches \\u2013 and all to an acceptable level of safety. Therefore, although initial suborbital pilots will originate from flight test schools and still possess similar traits to their earlier test pilot brethren, they should be protected by the right (safe) thing by design and analysis rather than rely on the right stuff due to ineffective design and operating procedures. The paper presents a review of the SpaceShip2 accident as a case study to highlight the right (safe) things that should be considered in the design, analysis and operations for suborbital operators. The authors of this paper contend that suborbital piloted vehicles should be designed with the knowledge and understanding and lessons learned from those early X-plane flights, lessons learned from general space safety, lessons learned from pilot Human Factors\\/ Crew Resource Management training and by understanding that safety management and safety engineering are essential disciplines that should be integrated with the design team from the concept phase.

Their physics is encoded in the higher n-point functions of the conformal theory. We study inclusive processes and argue that the inclusive production of unparticle stuff in standard model processes due to the unparticle self-interactions can be decomposed using the conformal partial wave expansion and its generalizations into a sum over contributions from the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff, corresponding to different primary conformal operators. Such processes typically involve the production of unparticle stuff associated with operators other than those to which the standard model couples directly. Thus just as interactions between particles allow scattering processes to produce new particles in the final state, so unparticle self-interactions cause the production of various kinds of unparticle stuff. We discuss both inclusive and exclusive methods for computing these processes. The resulting picture, we believe, is a step towards understanding what unparticle stuff \\u201clooks like\\u201d because it is quite analogous to way we describe the production and scattering of ordinary particles in quantum field theory, with the primary conformal operators playing the role of particles and the coefficients in the conformal partial wave expansion (and its generalization to include more fields) playing the role of amplitudes. We exemplify our methods in the 2D toy model that we discussed previously in which the Banks-Zaks theory is exactly solvable. ; Physics   Georgi, Howard; Kats, Yevgeny\"},{\"id\":\"080ca0728c80dee430ee7734ae613e1d0ee682ae15d09800c4250a27b793131e\",\"content\":\"\\u0421\\u043f\\u0440\\u0438\\u044f\\u0442\\u043b\\u0438\\u0432\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0441\\u043e\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e-\\u043f\\u0441\\u0438\\u0445\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u0438\\u0439 \\u043a\\u043b\\u0456\\u043c\\u0430\\u0442 \\u0443 \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u043c\\u0443 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u0456 \\u0442\\u0430 \\u0448\\u043b\\u044f\\u0445\\u0438 \\u0439\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0444\\u043e\\u0440\\u043c\\u0443\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f ; Favourable Social-Psychological Climate in a Teaching Stuff and Ways of its Forming \\u0423 \\u0441\\u0442\\u0430\\u0442\\u0442\\u0456 \\u043f\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430\\u043d\\u043e \\u0432\\u0438\\u0437\\u043d\\u0430\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f \\u0441\\u043e\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e-\\u043f\\u0441\\u0438\\u0445\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043a\\u043b\\u0456\\u043c\\u0430\\u0442\\u0443 \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u0443, \\u0439\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043f\\u043e\\u043a\\u0430\\u0437\\u043d\\u0438\\u043a\\u0456\\u0432, \\u044f\\u043a\\u0456 \\u0441\\u043f\\u0440\\u0438\\u044f\\u044e\\u0442\\u044c \\u0435\\u0444\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u0456\\u0439 \\u0440\\u043e\\u0431\\u043e\\u0442\\u0456 \\u0448\\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0438; \\u043a\\u043e\\u043d\\u043a\\u0440\\u0435\\u0442\\u0438\\u0437\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043e \\u0439\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0444\\u0443\\u043d\\u043a\\u0446\\u0456\\u0457, \\u044f\\u043a\\u0456 \\u0432\\u0456\\u043d \\u043f\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u043d\\u0435\\u043d \\u0432\\u0438\\u043a\\u043e\\u043d\\u0443\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u0438. \\u041d\\u0430 \\u043f\\u0456\\u0434\\u0441\\u0442\\u0430\\u0432\\u0456 \\u0430\\u043d\\u0430\\u043b\\u0456\\u0437\\u0443 \\u0442\\u0435\\u043e\\u0440\\u0435\\u0442\\u0438\\u0447\\u043d\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0434\\u043e\\u0441\\u043b\\u0456\\u0434\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u044c \\u0437\\u0440\\u043e\\u0431\\u043b\\u0435\\u043d\\u043e \\u0441\\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0431\\u0443 \\u0432\\u0438\\u0437\\u043d\\u0430\\u0447\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f \\u0448\\u043b\\u044f\\u0445\\u0456\\u0432 \\u0444\\u043e\\u0440\\u043c\\u0443\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u044f \\u0441\\u043f\\u0440\\u0438\\u044f\\u0442\\u043b\\u0438\\u0432\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0441\\u043e\\u0446\\u0456\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e- \\u043f\\u0441\\u0438\\u0445\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043a\\u043b\\u0456\\u043c\\u0430\\u0442\\u0443, \\u0432\\u043f\\u043b\\u0438\\u0432\\u0443 \\u043f\\u0435\\u0434\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0433\\u0456\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u0443 \\u043d\\u0430 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432 \\u0443\\u0447\\u043d\\u0456\\u0432 \\u044f\\u043a \\u043e\\u0434\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0437 \\u0444\\u0430\\u043a\\u0442\\u043e\\u0440\\u0456\\u0432 \\u0457\\u0445 \\u0441\\u043f\\u0456\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u0457 \\u0435\\u0444\\u0435\\u043a\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u043e\\u0457 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0432\\u0447\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u0457! \\u0432\\u0438\\u0445\\u043e\\u0432\\u043d\\u043e\\u0457 \\u0434\\u0456\\u044f\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u0456. ; In the article the determinations of social-psychological climate, its indexes which promote an effective work of school are given; functions which it must execute are specified there.

In this article we discuss extensions of Ostrom's approach to human genes and genomes and explore its limits and usefulness in this field. We argue that while there are radically different contexts and cases and governance regimes still to be debated, what we call \\\"genomic stuff\\\"-genomic material, data, and information-often can best be regulated by modes of stewardship and self-regulation of appropriators. We exemplify this claim by a discussion of gene patenting, the \\\"Genome War\\\", and the so-called HapMap project. The issue of how to best govern the genomic stuff of humans, we suggest, is complicated by the situation that the appropriator and the appropriated can be the same, inviting fundamental questions about politics and ethics.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the \\\"Law of the few\\\", the \\\"Stickiness factor\\\", and the \\\"Power of context\\\". For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as \\\"interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks\\\", for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.

Superflab, Super Stuff pink wax and Paraffin wax bolus materials are used with 15MeV electron energy for dosimetric comparison. Additionally, 10 mm thick Super Stuff pink wax bolus and paraffin wax bolus materials were placed on the right eyelid of a patient. Using electron dose calculation algorithm and ion chamber measurements, dosimetric comparisons were made in the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Both for measured and calculated dose, values were acquired 3 times and averaged for each case. Resulting differences are expressed as percentage differences. Dose differences were obtained in measurements with and without using bolus at several locations of the solid phantom, performed by the Roos Ion chamber. Dosimetric differences of 7-7.5% for Superflab, 10-10.5% for paraffin bolus and 13-14% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus are obtained. Besides, when dosimetric comparisons are made in the treatment planning system for cases with and without bolus; Dose differences were calculated to be 2-2.5% for superflab silicon bolus, 3-3.5% for paraffin wax bolus and 5-6% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus. To increase skin dose in curved anatomical structures in radiotherapy, it is safe to use the paraffin wax bolus material in radiotherapy clinic, as an alternative to Superflab silicon bolus and Super Stuff pink wax bolus materials, due to its low cost and ease of conforming to body surface contours.

We bring together theories from three different areas of research (peer production, Participatory Design and social practice theory), building a conceptual framework that is used to analyze extensive empirical material gathered while initiating, running and researching a \\u2018co-sewing caf\\u00e9\\u2019 over 18 months with hundreds of diverse participants. Tracing our understanding of use and participation through literature and case analysis, we use illustrative figures and tables to articulate different types and dimensions of use in relation to one another and in relation to the empirical analysis that is detailed and recounted in various ways. The paper concludes by elaborating how types of use in reference to types of stuff provide insight on participant skills, learning and engagement that can result in change of roles over time. ; Peer reviewed 6132 Visual arts and design; Infrastructuring; makerspaces; peer production; design; participatory design; user; use  Hirscher, Anja-Lisa; Maze, Ramia\"},{\"id\":\"4a77e92cfca91427a18127826aaf8b815538e9cda35fd14b38f273e5ed87c555\",\"content\":\"Alternative Proteins and the (Non)Stuff of \\u201cMeat\\u201d Beyond Meat, a food technology company based in California, is currently developing a range of plant-based proteins that aim to provide more sustainable, ethical, and healthful alternatives to conventional meat. Its products are also aiming to be viscerally equivalent in terms of their meatlike taste, texture, and overall sensory experience. These alternative proteins (APs) are not, however, intended merely as a substitute for conventional meat. Instead they are viewed and marketed by their developers as meat, made simply from a different raw material and via different methods. Yet as animal meat has become increasingly linked with environmental, health, and ethical concerns, Beyond Meat is having to negotiate a careful balance between positioning its products as meatlike in some respects and not meatlike in others in order to gain consumer adoption. To become \\u201cmeat\\u201d in consumer thinking not only depends on the things these APs are made of\\u2014both material and ideological\\u2014but also the things that are actively excluded; as such, their materiality is made of purposefully chosen \\u201cstuff\\u201d and \\u201cnon-stuff.\\u201d The article explores this decision-making via my fieldwork encounters with Beyond Meat's products. Using a visceral-autoethnographic approach, I discuss how certain (non)stuff was \\u201cmade to matter and not matter\\u201d (Evans and Miele 2012) to me during these encounters, and how this careful balancing of stuff can create new and problematic imaginaries, moral politics, and misguided understandings of what constitutes \\u201cbetter\\u201d foods and \\u201cbetter\\u201d eaters. The observations made contribute to existing discussions on visceral methodologies, perceptions of (novel) foods, embodied consumption practices, and the ways in which bodies are made as eaters and things as food.

The new Australian national science curriculum includes chemistry content at the primary level. Chemistry for young students is learning about changes in material stuff (matter) and, by implication, of what stuff is made. Pedagogy in this area needs to be guided by research if stepping stones to later learning of chemical ideas are to facilitate conceptual progress rather than hinder it. Further, recent findings advocate both the informal and formal introduction of aspects of the particulate model of matter at the primary level, provided certain teaching and learning strategies are used.

Ethical dilemmas of nursing in the Northern Ireland conflict The article explores a series of ethical and professional dilemmas that typified nursing practice during the \\u2018Troubles\\u2019 especially from the period 1968 to 1994 when the first IRA ceasefire was called.

Hence, the English contemporary political theatre has displayed unique interconnectedness between drama and politics: interest in US-Iraq war is indeed not an exception. British playwright, David Hare, belongs to a trend of war drama that enables the world to witness the truth, trauma and the violence of US-Iraq war. Stuff Happens subtly helps show how US coercive diplomacy manipulates other Powers to fulfill the new doctrine of \\\" New American Century.\\\" In Stuff Happens, Hare documents the recent tragic history of Iraq in such an approach that blends the documentary with the fictional to display the events from 2000, till the actual invasion of Iraq in April, 2003. The play traces the origins of US-Iraq war and unveils all the attempts and the procedures undertaken by Bush and his administration team to invade Iraq.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the \\\"Law of the few\\\", the \\\"Stickiness factor\\\", and the \\\"Power of context\\\". For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as \\\"interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks\\\", for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.

His reasons are persuasive. First, it provides a rich vein of initial stimulus material to tap, helping us to engage and intrigue even our least motivated learners. Second, it allows students to construct layers of meaning that might escape them purely through the written word. Students often find it easier to \\u2018read\\u2019 the tone of a source by listening to it and this can be a powerful way to consider perspective. Third, the use of this type of music supports close textual analysis, providing ways of exploring the lyrics at different levels. Finally, it helps us to pose rigorous historical questions about significance and interpretation. Enquiries that explore why people still sing about the Diggers and what impact Billie Holliday\\u2019s songs had on the Civil Rights movement provide students with both challenge and motivation. They also provide teachers with imaginative ways to combine depth and overview in their planning. L Education (General); LB1603 Secondary Education.

Even if his work is decidedly anti-dogmatic, over time the production of these images seems to follow a recurring pattern. The process is simple: The artist goes to a shop and buys second- rate movie stills, files them away using a provisional classification system, then selects some and cuts parts of them, sometimes add- ing touches of colour to certain areas, sometimes adding coloured dots and sometimes combining various images together. Baldessari selects the most generic images, the ones with no identity \\u2013 the \\u201cstuff nobody wants\\u201d: At one place I go to for movie stills, I look where the photographs are randomly thrown in boxes.

Mimesis and (the end of) magic in Walter Benjamin The paper focuses on the quite famous but also still quite mysterious idea of \\u201cimmaterial similarity\\u201d (or more literally \\u201cnonsensous similarity\\u201d) by Walter Benjamin. Benjamin argues that the production of an immaterial similarity is in some way an act of magic. But it is also at the same time an overcoming of magic itself. And the reason is that the \\u201cimmaterial similarity\\u201d can open the way to a \\u201cmaterialistic perspective\\u201d. How can that be? In order to answer, we\\u2019ll consider Benjamin\\u2019s idea of \\u201cmatter\\u201d. In Benjamin\\u2019s early writings matter (Materie) appears, as we shall see, as something magic. But there is another idea, which is quite near to matter but is not exactly the same: the idea of \\u201cstuff\\u201d (Stoff). The stuff is the \\u201cmaterial\\u201d things are made of.

Nasal carriage of MRSA among hospital stuff act as a source of endogenous infection and becomes a source for hospital and community acquired infection. The study was conducted to determine the rate antibiotic resistance pattern of nasal carriage of MRSA among the hospital stuff of Sir Salimullah Medical College and Mitford Hospital, Dhaka. Pre moistened nasal swabs from hospital stuff (doctor, nurses, lab technicians and other helping stuff were obtained. These swabs were inoculated into Blood agar and Mannitol salt agar media. Antibiogram was done by modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. MRSA were detected by oxacillin and cefoxitin disc diffusion method. The resistance was confirmed by MIC of oxacillin agar dilution method. Out of 142 samples 34 strains of Staphylococcus were isolated among them 07 (4.93%) were MRSA and 27 (19.01%) were MSSA. The carriage rate of MRSA was higher among nurse than other healthcare provider. Nasal carriage of MRSA is responsible for spreading infection from healthcare personnel to normal individual. So, regular screening of carrier is required from prevention of hospital acquired infection.

Whilst dance is known as a feminine activity, males tend to be even more in the minority in more \\u2018feminised\\u2019 genres, such as ballet. However, in other genres, such as street dance, which allows them to conform to a more traditionally masculine identity, they are in the majority. Regardless of genre, however, males are more often found in positions of power within the dance-performer\\u2019s world compared to their female counterparts. Dance teachers clearly have an important role to play in dance students\\u2019 perceptions of gendered (in)equalities within the dance world, where the majority of dance teachers are female. To date, however, their perceptions have been under-researched. To address this research gap, 10 female professional dance teachers, ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, were interviewed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis through the theoretical lens of symbolic interactionism. Two salient themes were identified: coolness and masculinity, and male privilege. Participants perceived that gender inequalities did exist within dance genres and in the opportunities afforded to male and female dancers. These inequalities appeared to lead to a greater valorisation of male dancers in terms of physical and psychological characteristics. The perceptions of female dance teachers in general are important in relation to the socialisation of future dance professionals.

In general, film genres help us understand the world. More specifically, the Hollywood Western is the film\\u2019s point of departure for its depiction of the astronaut\\u2019s immediate predecessor \\u2013 the test pilot; yet it is the family melodrama and the comedy that should be acknowledged as more important for understanding the astronaut as the test pilot\\u2019s successor. To be precise, understanding the history of space travel in terms of Hollywood genres requires an examination of the way in which THE RIGHT STUFF has marked the transition from a covert, military operation (test pilots) to a civilian public relations project (astronauts) as the succession of the Western by the family melodrama and the comedy of remarriage.

We pose a number of questions: how do inhabitants and their media stuff adapt to the more rigid physical spaces of a building? How does the building respond to the more rapid changes to dwelling produced by this media stuff? And how are these differing times synchronised? In answer to these questions we present four case studies of homes in Melbourne, Australia, each representative of a particular strategy of synchronisation. They are: the found home, the imagined home, the designed home, and the renovated home. We identify logics informing these homes: the first naturalises the choices made, the second rationalises choices, and the third is one in which dwelling and (re)building are intertwined.

We argue that while there are radically different contexts and cases and governance regimes still to be debated, what we call 'genomic stuff' genomic material, data, and information often can best be regulated by modes of stewardship and self-regulation of appropriators. We exemplify this claim by a discussion of gene patenting, the 'Genome War', and the so-called HapMap project.

In this paper, a mechanism is presented that prevents the occurrence of stuff bits in the whole frame completely. It makes the duration of frame transmissions fixed and, hence, it achieves very accurate reception times. An optimized codec has been implemented to demonstrate that this approach is feasible and can be profitably adopted in low-cost networked embedded systems with demanding timing constraints.

Exotic technologies - iconically information and communication technologies and biotechnologies - typically evoke change and the novel character of the present epoch. Yet these enter a world of mundane technologies that putatively serve merely in social reproduction. It is argued that such a stark contrast is untenable. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres, the temporality of technology is re-conceived in terms of patterns of order\\/disorder to which both exotic and mundane technologies contribute. The minimal parameters needed to articulate the nature of such a complexly temporalized sociotechnical stuff are outlined.

This dilemma can be avoided if objects truly have vague boundaries. It is metaphysically impossible for an entity with a vague boundary to be embedded within an entity of the same kind. A cloud's parts (that is, cloud stuff) cannot be clearly embedded within the vague boundary region of another cloud, for the latter region is defined as possessing neither cloud-stuff nor non-cloud-stuff. Likewise, there cannot be a cloud with a vague boundary embedded in the middle of another cloud because there would then have to be a population of water droplets dense enough to compose part of the larger cloud which was nevertheless insufficient in density to compose part of the embedded cloud.

Characterized as a kind of intermediate stuff, the apeiron turns out to consist of contraries and as such is impossible. Commentators have rightly noted this point and some have also indicated that Aristotle offers an argument of sorts for his negative estimate. However, the argument has received scant attention, and it is fair to say that it remains unclear exactly why Aristotle rejects Anaximander\\u2019s intermediate stuff. Indeed, it is unclear how Aristotle\\u2019s argument is supposed to run in the first place. This paper offers a reconstruction of Aristotle\\u2019s argument for the impossibility of the apeiron , and on this basis offers to explain Aristotle\\u2019s grounds for rejecting Anaximander\\u2019s intermediate stuff. This is especially called for in light of the fact that Aristotle himself thinks that there can be intermediate stuffs. Finally, some attention is given to the parallel between the apeiron and Aristotle\\u2019s prime matter.

Malouf showed himself more concerned with the particulars of a world disparaged sometimes as new than with critical contrasts between it and the parent cultures of Europe. For Malouf's prose fiction, from Johnno (1975) to the present, has revealed him to be, by intuition and craft, a maker of metaphors and seldom an ironist or satirist.

According to his patent, 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde is an anti-tumor agent without any sideeffects. My impression is that this stuff is capable of preventing carcinogenesis when used quantitatively sufficiently. In order to treat developed cancers, you ought to start giving your cancer patient a small dose of the stuff because, otherwise, the patient may suffer from a serious hemorrhage of the tumor caused by excessive necroses.

Therefore, sedentary behaviour should be targeted as important health behaviour.It is known that even relatively small changes of health behaviour often require serious efforts from an individual and from people in their environment to become part of their lifestyle. Therefore, interventions to promote healthy behaviours should ideally be simple, easy to perform and easily available. Since sitting is likely to be highly habitual, confrontation with an intervention should almost automatically elicit a reaction of getting up, and thus break up and reduce sitting time. One important prerequisite for successful dissemination of such an intervention could be the use of a recognisable term relating to sedentary behaviour, which should have the characteristics of an effective brand name. To become wide spread, this term may need to meet three criteria: the 'Law of the few' , the 'Stickiness factor' , and the 'Power of context'. For that purpose we introduce STUFF: Stand Up For Fitness. STUFF can be defined as 'interrupting long sitting periods by short breaks' , for instance, interrupting sitting every 30 min by standing for at least five minutes.Even though we still need evidence to test the health-enhancing effects of interrupted sitting, we hope that the introduction of STUFF will facilitate the testing of the social, psychological and health effects of interventions to reduce sitting time.

As a National Science Foundation funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Center, it is part of PCCM\\u2019s mission to inspire and educate school children, teachers and the public about STEM and materials science. Research shows that it is critical to excite students at a young age and maintain that excitement, and without that these, students are two to three times less likely to have any interest in science and engineering and pursue science careers as adults. The Making Stuff TV series offered a great teachable moment in materials science for students and teachers alike. The four episodes, Stronger, Smaller, Smarter and Cleaner aired in January and February, 2011. Our complementary education program helped promote the viewership of the Making Stuff series in the region, and the NOVA episodes helped us by priming the teachers and students to learn more about materials science research conducted at Princeton University. The Making Stuff coalition events we conducted were designed to have the maximum positive impact on students\\u2019 attitudes towards science and scientists, in general, and materials scientists and engineers, specifically. Each and every student had an opportunity to interact with dozens of scientists and engineers, in the lab, at table demonstrations and lecture presentations. As an ongoing MRSEC education and outreach program we have developed many successful educational partnerships to increase our impact. Plus, through years of successful education programs and the participation of our materials scientists and engineers, we have cultivated great trust in the schools and local community. The schools eagerly joined as partners in the program to bring their students to the event. Teachers from those partner schools actively participated in associated professional development programs conducted by education staff and PCCM professors before and after the big event. Included were presentations by MRSEC members and the partners from Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials (PRISM), Princeton University\\u2019s chemistry department, DOE funded centers PP-SOC and PPPL, Liberty Science Center, Franklin Institute, our PBS partner NJN and our many school district partners.

This comprised six main capabilities each containing 4\\u201310 behavioural indicators: client relationships; professionalism; communication skills; decision-making and problem solving; commitment to animal welfare; and commitment to quality and the profession. An online survey was then conducted to validate the importance of these capabilities, which was completed by 1446 mostly UK and Australian clients. The data have allowed us to develop a \\u2018Client Hierarchy of Needs\\u2019 which emphasises the fundamental importance of commitment to animal welfare and veterinary capabilities to the client experience.

When it comes to practical attempts to operationalise sustainable development, however, the social stuff is often neglected. In this paper, we provide a detailed exploration of how the concept of social sustainability is operationalised (and therefore understood) within the aquaculture certification context. We found that a) certification schemes do address social sustainability, but relevant indicators mostly focus on workers rights, or link directly back to environmental sustainability (through the consequences of environmental impact on humans); and b) the actions required often add little over and above existing legal requirements. Essentially, aquaculture sustainability certification schemes have not (yet) taken the opportunity to further shape our understanding of what social sustainability means, or how it is practiced. The consequence of this may be the impression that industries are truly sustainable, just because they have obtained sustainability certification.

Aristotle does indeed describe certain things as extended, movable, and corporeal: for example, the five elements, earth, water, air, fire, and ether, as well as everything made out of them. He also has the concept of a material cause, that is, the raw materials out of which something can be made or generated, and he makes frequent use of this concept in his analysis of perceptible substances. Still, the fact that Aristotle thought about what perceptible substances are made of is insufficient evidence for attributing to him the concept of matter as physical stuff. In addition, we would want to know whether he thought that all perceptible substances are extended, movable, and corporeal precisely because they are made out of matter, and whether any aspect of their behavior is to be explained simply by virtue of their nature as material objects.

Combining survey and interviews, I focus analysis on three aspects: awareness, knowledge and concern; role of scientific and social frames in shaping general attitude; and spatial attribution of causes and consequences. The study reveals a universal awareness and high concern about climate change among the respondents, although understanding and perceptions of climate change are significantly socially framed. Social situatedness, more than scientific facts, is the most important definer of overall engagement with climate change.

Antibiotic residues in food stuff cause bacterial resistance, allergic reactions, toxicity, carcinogenic effects and change of natural micro flora of intestine in consumers. So, the aim of the present study is detection of antibiotic residues and its contamination rate in cultured rainbow trout. Four-plate test is one of the microbiological methods of detecting antibiotic residues in food stuff, which is based on inhibition zone formation around the sample in four culture media with different pH and test bacteria. For this purpose, 45 samples from skin and meat of rainbow trout fish were obtained randomly from fish market of Tabriz city. After different phases of four-plate test, from a total of 180 skin samples, 13 cases (7.22%) and from a total of 180 meat samples, 18 cases (10%) were diagnosed to be contaminated to antibiotic residues. The results showed that contamination rate of two tissues, (meat and skin), have no significant difference (P>0.05), and the highest contamination to antibiotic residues were related to penicillin and macrolides groups (P<0.05).

However, industrial reserves of rock-chrystal lodes, that is die most pure source of quartz stuff with minimal mineral admixturer, are practically exhausted everywhere. All this results in usage of.low quality stuff and, thus, to significant complication of technological schemes of quartz processing and concentration, to high energy waste, high waste of inorganic acids, significant increase of industrial waste. Quartz concentrate output according to traditional technologies of lode quartz processing on Urals deposits is not more then 35%. In this turn the part of defectless transparent quartz glass when smelting from granular quartz is not more then .30%. It is evident that low efficiency of quartz industry call to new scale technological decisions. 1  Environment. Technology. Resources.

At the 2001 Irish Times\\/ESB Theatre Awards, a member of the judging panel lamented the scarcity of new Irish plays, stating that he wanted to describe 2001 as a good year for Irish theatre \\u2013 but couldn\\u2019t. Media reports on Irish theatre enhance this sense of gloom: the Abbey has lurched from controversy over its production of Barbaric Comedies to criticism of its proposal to relocate to Dublin\\u2019s docklands; the Gate has publicly disagreed with the Arts Council over its funding; and despite its international success, Galway audiences are reportedly frustrated by what they perceive to be Druid Theatre\\u2019s irrelevance to them. What makes this apparent negativity difficult to understand is that, as recently as 1999, many commentators were declaring that Irish theatre had entered a new golden age, and that a second renaissance had been signaled by the emergence of plays like The Steward of Christendom, Portia Coughlan, and The Weir. As reports of the demise of the Celtic Tiger illustrate, this sudden shift from celebration to despondency is not exclusive to commentary on Irish theatre \\u2013 and perhaps what is most evident in such reports is the Irish media\\u2019s tendency to exaggerate. The value of Theatre Stuff, an excellent collection of essays from Carysfort Press, is that it brings clear-headed analysis to a debate that has hitherto been dominated by marketing and excessively exuberant journalism. ; non-peer-reviewed Irish theatre; Drama; Theatre studies  Lonergan, Patrick\"},{\"id\":\"7217fcb6bf05db7c61e69d3083b4d4b5ab1ed22cee1df198511656c7fd742220\",\"content\":\"APPLICATION OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT TO VARIOUS BUILDING LIFETIME SHEARING LAYERS: SITE, STRUCTURE, SKIN, SERVICES, SPACE, AND STUFF Currently, green rating systems are not directly related to environmental consequences. Moreover, rating systems score both building-related tasks with long lifetime expectancies and system-related tasks with short lifetime expectancies without separating them. Therefore, passive solar and bio-climatic architectures, which have long lifetime expectancies and thus have a strong, negative impact on the environment, are neglected. The main goal of this study is to explore differences in total environmental impact for a single \\u201ctypical\\u201d building module (with the heavy wall building technology accepted in Israel) in terms of six different lifetime shearing layers, Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff, each of which reflects a different form of environmental damage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the six shearing layers using life cycle assessment (LCA) by applying Eco-indicator 99 (EI99). It was found that the environmental damage associated with the Building layers (Site, Structure, and Skin) was higher than that associated with the Service layers (Services, Space Plan, and Stuff). The paper may contribute to the development of a more scientific (quantitative) background for green rating systems. As a result, a greater decrease in building-related ecological impacts can be achieved, thus encouraging sustainable building activities.

In conversational data, the most frequent forms cited as examples of this category are or something , and everything , and things and and stuff , which are described as \\u2018coordination tags\\u2019 by Biber et al. (1999: 115\\u201316). This label has not been widely adopted, but the linguistic category it describes has clearly become established as part of modern English. The term \\u2018general extender\\u2019 (Overstreet, 1999) is now commonly used to refer to this category: \\u2018\\u201cgeneral\\u201d because they are nonspecific and \\u201cextender\\u201d because they extend otherwise complete utterances\\u2019 (1999: 3). There are two subcategories: adjunctive general extenders, beginning with and , and disjunctive general extenders, beginning with or . In casual conversation, general extenders are typically phrase- or clause-final, consisting of and\\/or plus a vague noun ( stuff\\/things ) or a pronoun ( something\\/everything ), with an optional comparative phrase ( like that\\/this ). In everyday spoken British English, the phrase and (all) that is also extremely common. In written and formal spoken English, forms with quite different structures, such as et cetera , and so on, and so forth , and or so are more typically used to fulfill related functions.

KiP is an epistemological perspective that views knowledge as a complex system of many types of knowledge elements. These include the so-called explanatory primitives (e-prims), that is, intuitive knowledge elements that people use when interpreting the world. The aim of this study was to gauge the potential of KiP in the field of research on pre-instructional conceptual knowledge in the geosciences by analysing conceptions of the complex hydrological issue of the formation of water springs. When probing student explanations of springs for e-prims in two case studies involving 12-year-old boys, we identified two explanatory primitives not previously documented.

Stag parties have become socially expected as a rite of passage, pre-marriage celebration for men that usually involves excessive alcohol consumption and engagement in deviant, potentially harmful, behaviour. These events produce a shift in time and space, and together with group expectations for celebration, increase the impetus for excessive consumption. Our contention is that excessive consumption of alcohol and deviant behaviour that often takes place are partially rooted in commercial ideology which has become firmly embedded in the attitudes of young British men.

As imaginative engagements with this supposed esoteric coterie (a group allegedly comprised of Marlowe, Ralegh, Hariot, Chapman, and other Elizabethan notables) in contemporary novels are frequently linked with fictionalisations of research activity and academic enquiry, this article first traces the contours of the School\\u2019s rise and fall in\\u2014as well as its spectral haunting of\\u2014real-life, twentieth-century scholarship before shifting focus to Alan Wall\\u2019s School of Night (2001), Louis Bayard\\u2019s The School of Night (2011) and Deborah Harkness\\u2019s Shadow of Night (2012). I argue that these three recent academic novels share far more than their near-identical titles, for in them, we find a consistent constellation of the supposed Elizabethan group with concerns of factuality, authority and legitimacy. Furthermore, in all of these novels, the payoff of bringing a fictive researcher into contact with the School of Night is ultimately the same: it provides a platform for reimagining of the nexus of historical and intertextual relationships surrounding Marlowe and Shakespeare. ;

Research showed insufficient knowledge of medical stuff about principles and skills of counseling, low level knowledge of nonmedical stuff on the questions of decision of HIV-status and skills of counseling. \\u0434\\u0435\\u0442\\u0438; \\u0412\\u0418\\u0427-\\u0441\\u0442\\u0430\\u0442\\u0443\\u0441; \\u0438\\u043d\\u0444\\u043e\\u0440\\u043c\\u0438\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u044c \\u043c\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438\\u0446\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0438 \\u0441\\u043e\\u0446\\u0438\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u044b\\u0445 \\u0440\\u0430\\u0431\\u043e\\u0442\\u043d\\u0438\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432; children; HIV-status; knowledge of medical and social workers  \\u041a\\u043e\\u0442\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430, \\u041d. \\u0412.; \\u0421\\u0442\\u0430\\u0440\\u0435\\u0446\\u044c, \\u041e. \\u041e.; Kotova, N.

The aim of this study was to investigate the current expectations and needs of veterinary clients across a range of practice types. Interviews and focus groups were undertaken with veterinary clients to identify the capabilities of veterinarians that result in the best client experience, generating a \\u2018Veterinary Capability Framework\\u2019. This comprised six main capabilities each containing 4\\u201310 behavioural indicators: client relationships; professionalism; communication skills; decision-making and problem solving; commitment to animal welfare; and commitment to quality and the profession. An online survey was then conducted to validate the importance of these capabilities, which was completed by 1446 mostly UK and Australian clients. The data have allowed us to develop a \\u2018Client Hierarchy of Needs\\u2019 which emphasises the fundamental importance of commitment to animal welfare and veterinary capabilities to the client experience. This study is part of the VetSet2Go project, a collaborative international project to define the capabilities most important for employability and success in the veterinary profession today.

When it comes to practical attempts to operationalise sustainable development, however, the \\u2018social stuff\\u2019 is often neglected. In this paper, we provide a detailed exploration of how the concept of social sustainability is operationalised (and therefore understood) within the aquaculture certification context. We found that a) certification schemes do address social sustainability, but relevant indicators mostly focus on workers\\u2019 rights, or link directly back to environmental sustainability (through the consequences of environmental impact on humans); and b) the actions required often add little over and above existing legal requirements. Essentially, aquaculture sustainability certification schemes have not (yet) taken the opportunity to further shape our understanding of what social sustainability means, or how it is practiced. The consequence of this may be the impression that industries are truly sustainable, just because they have obtained sustainability certification. social sustainability; aquaculture; certification; social Indicators  Alexander, KA; Amundsen, VS; Osmundsen, TC\"},{\"id\":\"7f75ac5bb4d3916a27db8b83297d30920adbc00d902fb1143f267f0cb5a26987\",\"content\":\"Exploring Partnership Work as a Form of Transformative Education: \\u201cYou do your yapping and I just add in my stuff\\u201d This paper details the work of a group of learning disabled people (people with intellectual disabilities) who contribute to the teaching of students undertaking a degree program at one of the UK's most elite universities. Traditional notions relating to knowledge production within academia are examined and we demonstrate how the participation of learning disabled people in classroom teaching challenges these. Drawing on the work of Freire (1972) the paper demonstrates how co-teaching by learning disabled people has a transformative impact on educational experiences. Finally, the current changes impacting the UK higher education sector are detailed and we explore how these changes are negatively impacting on courses that seek to move away from traditional approaches to pedagogy.
