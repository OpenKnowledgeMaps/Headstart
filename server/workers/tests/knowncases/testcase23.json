Recent studies of material culture emphasizes the meaning of things as well as stuff and start from the idea that they can be perceived and seen as signs that help their owners and users in their communicative processes, and in the formation of identities. I believe that perceiving these processes as a dynamic network of interrelations will help establish accurate and participatory phenomenological connections with other members of society, and better understand the symmetrical relationships between people, things, and stuff. ; Este ensaio espera tratar das qualidades da cultura material e das subst\\u00e2ncias, as comunicativas e as expressivas, independentemente de qualquer limite cronol\\u00f3gico e atrav\\u00e9s de um di\\u00e1logo interdisciplinar com arque\\u00f3logos, antrop\\u00f3logos, historiadores, soci\\u00f3logos, economistas, psic\\u00f3logos e fil\\u00f3sofos.

Additionally, 10 mm thick Super Stuff pink wax bolus and paraffin wax bolus materials were placed on the right eyelid of a patient. Using electron dose calculation algorithm and ion chamber measurements, dosimetric comparisons were made in the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Both for measured and calculated dose, values were acquired 3 times and averaged for each case. Resulting differences are expressed as percentage differences. Dose differences were obtained in measurements with and without using bolus at several locations of the solid phantom, performed by the Roos Ion chamber. Dosimetric differences of 7-7.5% for Superflab, 10-10.5% for paraffin bolus and 13-14% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus are obtained. Besides, when dosimetric comparisons are made in the treatment planning system for cases with and without bolus; Dose differences were calculated to be 2-2.5% for superflab silicon bolus, 3-3.5% for paraffin wax bolus and 5-6% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus. To increase skin dose in curved anatomical structures in radiotherapy, it is safe to use the paraffin wax bolus material in radiotherapy clinic, as an alternative to Superflab silicon bolus and Super Stuff pink wax bolus materials, due to its low cost and ease of conforming to body surface contours.\",\"published_in\":\"Volume: 16, Issue: 2 201-205 ; 1305-130X ; 1305-1385 ; Celal Bayar University Journal of Science\",\"year\":\"2020-06-24T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Radiotherapy,Superflab,Paraffin,Super Stuff\",\"subject\":\"Radiotherapy,Superflab,Paraffin,Super Stuff\",\"authors\":\"ARAS, Serhat; TANZER, \\u0130hsan Oguz; \\u0130K\\u0130ZCEL\\u0130, T\\u00fcrkan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/cbayarfbe\\/issue\\/55133\\/654782\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"aef90adac1fcf5749967853e586d7084350db74d0886d1d878de7727635d27ba\",\"relevance\":111},{\"id\":\"181a0dee28573750785430d02d62555376dbbf41641fbd65d2962a31c4cd3686\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.uokufa.edu.iq\\/index.php\\/kufa_arts\\/article\\/view\\/7696\\/pdf; http:\\/\\/journals.uokufa.edu.iq\\/index.php\\/kufa_arts\\/article\\/view\\/7696\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.uokufa.edu.iq\\/index.php\\/kufa_arts\\/article\\/view\\/7696\",\"title\":\"Dramatic Responses to US-Iraq War: A Study in David Hare's Stuff Happens\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Contemporary War drama is described as a reaction to the profound suffering brought up by war that has, unfortunately, become a supreme language of communication in the Modern era.

Stuff Happens subtly helps show how US coercive diplomacy manipulates other Powers to fulfill the new doctrine of \\\" New American Century.\\\" In Stuff Happens, Hare documents the recent tragic history of Iraq in such an approach that blends the documentary with the fictional to display the events from 2000, till the actual invasion of Iraq in April, 2003. The play traces the origins of US-Iraq war and unveils all the attempts and the procedures undertaken by Bush and his administration team to invade Iraq.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0627\\u062f\\u0627\\u0628 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0643\\u0640\\u0648\\u0641\\u0629; Vol 2, No 37 (2018): \\u0645\\u062c\\u0644\\u0629 \\u0627\\u062f\\u0627\\u0628 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0643\\u0648\\u0641\\u0629 ; 1994-8999\",\"year\":\"2018-11-28\",\"subject_orig\":\"Dramatic Responses to US-Iraq War: A Study in David Hare's Stuff Happens\",\"subject\":\"Dramatic Responses to US-Iraq War: A Study in David Hare's Stuff Happens\",\"authors\":\"Ghani, Hana Khaleif; Chellab, Mithal\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.uokufa.edu.iq\\/index.php\\/kufa_arts\\/article\\/view\\/7696\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"181a0dee28573750785430d02d62555376dbbf41641fbd65d2962a31c4cd3686\",\"relevance\":110},{\"id\":\"cb586d945653d97e31975a37dcac01404a14751f2d7a05d243a0ae2f982f6405\",\"relation\":\"Alexander, KA orcid:0000-0001-8801-413X , Amundsen, VS and Osmundsen, TC 2020 , '\\u2018Social stuff\\u2019 and all that jazz: understanding the residual category of social sustainability' , Environmental Science and Policy, vol. 112 , pp. 61-68 , doi:10.1016\\/j.envsci.2020.06.003 <http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.envsci.2020.06.003>.\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.utas.edu.au\\/33571\\/\",\"title\":\"\\u2018Social stuff\\u2019 and all that jazz: understanding the residual category of social sustainability\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Recently we have seen a substantial increase in pressure for industries, such as aquaculture, to become more sustainable.

Wilson is a PhD candidate in Theatre Studies at the University of Otago, who recently completed an MA which explored ethical authorship of British theatrical work produced in response to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. He is the artistic director of Arcade, a Dunedin-based performing arts company.\",\"published_in\":\"New Theatre Quarterly ; volume 36, issue 1, page 56-72 ; ISSN 0266-464X 1474-0613\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Visual Arts and Performing Arts\",\"subject\":\"Visual Arts and Performing Arts\",\"authors\":\"Wilson, Alex D.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0266464x2000010x\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"237bb16923091623c9c88fbb5608b3e8a8254e016a311f40d18302f1c6a223b0\",\"relevance\":103},{\"id\":\"38f661e853dd8ccf8d0736cb929c167373ce7e22472b8e21bf5939ecc74e423d\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0266078419000415\",\"title\":\"Vague language in Hong Kong English, \\u2018Something like that\\u2019 ; A comparative corpus investigation into a defining feature of English in Hong Kong\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The computational analysis of corpora, a body of \\u2018naturally occurring language texts chosen to characterize a state of variety of a language\\u2019 (Sinclair, 1991: 171) provided the opportunity to reveal otherwise unobservable features and patterns across varieties, registers and languages.

He wrote more than 500 film and television scores over the course of a 60-year career; he redefined ossified cinematic genres; and perhaps most toweringly of all, with his collaborations with director Sergio Leone, he composed some of the few snatches of film music that are easily recognised by those who do not easily recognise film music.\",\"published_in\":\"Senses of Cinema , Vol. 95 (Jul 2020)\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Golding, Dan\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/456788\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"60cc1f6513080dfd533b74ea632db7dacd73c03cc20a34c4ef154ff4cca0620a\",\"relevance\":101},{\"id\":\"c5c6c22149f4f5cf6533773a4abdbc9d69333d3165f107a35cf2de5636615e11\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/chiz.nangu.edu.ua\\/article\\/view\\/168210\\/167996\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/chiz.nangu.edu.ua\\/article\\/view\\/168210\",\"title\":\"\\u041c\\u0415\\u0422\\u041e\\u0414\\u0418\\u041a\\u0410 \\u0412\\u0418\\u0417\\u041d\\u0410\\u0427\\u0415\\u041d\\u041d\\u042f \\u0414\\u041e\\u0426\\u0406\\u041b\\u042c\\u041d\\u041e\\u0407 \\u041e\\u0420\\u0413\\u0410\\u041d\\u0406\\u0417\\u0410\\u0426\\u0406\\u0419\\u041d\\u041e-\\u0428\\u0422\\u0410\\u0422\\u041d\\u041e\\u0407 \\u0421\\u0422\\u0420\\u0423\\u041a\\u0422\\u0423\\u0420\\u0418 \\u0427\\u0410\\u0421\\u0422\\u0418\\u041d\\u0418 \\u0421\\u041f\\u0415\\u0426\\u0406\\u0410\\u041b\\u042c\\u041d\\u041e\\u0413\\u041e \\u041f\\u0420\\u0418\\u0417\\u041d\\u0410\\u0427\\u0415\\u041d\\u041d\\u042f \\u0412\\u041d\\u0423\\u0422\\u0420\\u0406\\u0428\\u041d\\u0406\\u0425 \\u0412\\u0406\\u0419\\u0421\\u042c\\u041a \\u0412\\u0418\\u0425\\u041e\\u0414\\u042f\\u0427\\u0418 \\u0417 \\u041e\\u0421\\u041e\\u0411\\u041b\\u0418\\u0412\\u041e\\u0421\\u0422\\u0415\\u0419 \\u0412\\u0418\\u041a\\u041e\\u041d\\u0423\\u0412\\u0410\\u041d\\u0418\\u0425 \\u041d\\u0415\\u042e \\u0421\\u041b\\u0423\\u0416\\u0411\\u041e\\u0412\\u041e-\\u0411\\u041e\\u0419\\u041e\\u0412\\u0418\\u0425 \\u0417\\u0410\\u0412\\u0414\\u0410\\u041d\\u042c ;

Therefore, interventions that promote sexual health and reduce risk are critical to develop for these couples. Given the disproportionate burden of HIV among populations of color, it is also critical that these interventions are culturally congruent. The EBAN intervention for African American serodiscordant couples recognizes the centrality of culture in shap\\u00ading sexual behaviors and helps couples develop intimacy and positive prevention behaviors. The analytic objective of our study was to examine the knowledge and awareness gained by participants in the intervention. Participants: Participants (n=17) who com\\u00adpleted at least half of the eight intervention sessions. Methods: Brief post-implementation semi-structured interviews were conducted be\\u00adtween January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Team-based, targeted content analysis focused on knowledge and awareness gains. Results: Participants described learning about sexual health, expanded sexual options, and sexual communication. The \\u201cEBAN caf\\u00e9,\\u201d a component that gives couples a menu of options for safer sex behaviors, was particularly popular.

Conclusions: Couples at risk for HIV trans\\u00admission benefit from strengthening skills and knowledge related to healthy sexual\\u00adity.

Using posts (n = 975) on Facebook pages and tweets (n = 889) on Twitter handles of Stuff.co.nz and NZHerald.co.nz from 12 November to 17 November, we analysed how media users reacted to breaking news coverage of a major natural disaster. The results show that quake news gets significantly more interaction and reactions than non-quake news on both social media platforms. For Twitter, quake news gets significantly more interactions such as likes, and retweets, but not replies. However, for Facebook, quake news gets significantly more comments, likes, wows, and sad emotional feedbacks, but no significant difference in emotions such as love, haha, and angry. The emotions people have on Facebook indicate well the nature of the news. With Facebook\\u2019s new function of reactions including, like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry, makes reactions more expressive and relevant. The study also shows a clear pattern of reactions on the two social media platforms across the timeline. While the number of posts keeps stable over the period, users\\u2019 reactions soared in the first two days of the quake; The responses subsided after the chaotic period of the disaster was over.

Despite the community's efforts in data collection, there are still few image datasets covering a wide range of scenes and object categories with dense and detailed annotations for scene parsing. In this paper, we introduce and analyze the ADE20K dataset, spanning diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases even parts of parts. A scene parsing benchmark is built upon the ADE20K with 150 object and stuff classes included. Several segmentation baseline models are evaluated on the benchmark. A novel network design called Cascade Segmentation Module is proposed to parse a scene into stuff, objects, and object parts in a cascade and improve over the baselines. We further show that the trained scene parsing networks can lead to applications such as image content removal and scene synthesis. \\u00a92017 Paper presented at the 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017), July 21-26, 2017, Honolulu, Hawaii. ; NSF (grant no. 1524817)\",\"published_in\":\"MIT web domain\",\"year\":\"2019-07-11T16:46:10Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Zhou, Bolei; Zhao, Hang; Puig Fernandez, Francesco Xavier; Fidler, Sanja; Barriuso, Adela; Torralba, Antonio\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1721.1\\/124982\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"493f9417a0f52a8eb32ecfce97750c6dbe68b6ead617e1feed95b78871b5bc23\",\"relevance\":93},{\"id\":\"c3a982ad1ca353c721bd1687b52c1c1076178d21947514a02cf2a0118010043b\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/1424-8220\\/19\\/19\\/4295; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1424-8220; 1424-8220; doi:10.3390\\/s19194295; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/27876ab456d441ca8265e8c009b5d634\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/s19194295; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/27876ab456d441ca8265e8c009b5d634\",\"title\":\"Wearables Meet IoT: Synergistic Personal Area Networks (SPANs)\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Wearable monitoring and mobile health (mHealth) revolutionized healthcare diagnostics and delivery, while the exponential increase of deployed \\u201cthings\\u201d in the Internet of things (IoT) transforms our homes and industries. \\u201cThings\\u201d with embedded activity and vital sign sensors that we refer to as \\u201csmart stuff\\u201d can interact with wearable and ambient sensors.

The case of Israel illustrates implementation of a system for assessing and assuring quality standards in higher education that is recognized as one of the highest national priorities. Quality assurance at Israeli higher education institutions is regulated by The Quality Assessment and Assurance Division. Nevertheless, Israeli Council for Higher Education promotes culture of establishing internal mechanisms to assure academic quality. The case study of quality assurance strategies in Israeli higher education institutions was focused on the analysis of key activities managed by teaching and learning centers. These centers are dedicated to professional development of faculty members to promote learning outcome of study programs through innovative teaching methodologies. Missions and functions of the centers are based on common international standards. The spectrum of activities includes: professional development of teaching stuff (workshops for newly recruited both senior and junior stuff, and individual teaching consultations to senior stuff); technological and pedagogical support for curricula and course design (from lecture-based to fully online-courses support); implementation and integration of new technologies: particularly by scouting, absorbing and effectively implementing digital technologies; and conducting students\\u2019 teaching satisfaction surveys.

The goal of this study is to explore children\\u2019s practices, perceptions, and knowledge regarding passwords. Given the limited work to date and that the world\\u2019s cyber posture and culture will be dependent on today\\u2019s youth, it is imperative to conduct cyber-security research with children. We conducted surveys of 189 3rd to 8th graders from two Midwest schools in the USA. We found that children have on average two passwords for school and three to four passwords for home. They kept their passwords private and did not share with others. They created passwords with an average length of 7 (3rd to 5th graders) and 10 (6\\u20138th graders). But, only about 13% of the children created very strong passwords. Generating strong passwords requires mature cognitive and linguistic capabilities which children at this developmental stage have not yet mastered. They believed that passwords provide access control, protect their privacy and keep their \\u201cstuff\\u201d safe. Overall, children had appropriate mental models of passwords and demonstrated good password practices. Cyber-security education should strive to reinforce these positive practices while continuing to provide and promote age-appropriate developmental security skills. Given the study\\u2019s sample size and limited generalizability, we are expanding our research to include children from 3rd to 12th graders across multiple US school districts.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Cybersecurity ; volume 5, issue 1 ; ISSN 2057-2085 2057-2093\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Choong, Yee-Yin; Theofanos, Mary F; Renaud, Karen; Prior, Suzanne\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/cybsec\\/tyz015\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"4896677552bbdde993ad8c5671edc73a6fe34a096e08dc2108b05477be7948e5\",\"relevance\":77},{\"id\":\"e592e61b0d5e53c2548a2951e56263f62b6864091a549a6227d07b84b0774b8c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/tidsskrift.dk\\/historisktidsskrift\\/article\\/view\\/115504\\/163810\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/tidsskrift.dk\\/historisktidsskrift\\/article\\/view\\/115504\",\"title\":\"M\\u00e6nd af det rette stof.

Selection practices in The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, an elite military unit in the Arctic 1950\\u20132015This article investigates the development of the selection practice for the Danish Army\\u2019s Sirius unit. The dog sled patrol protects the sovereignty of the realm and maintains surveillance in Northeast Greenland by patrolling the uninhabited national park. The investigation is primarily based on interviews with former, retired and current managers of the unit, as well as psychologists involved in the selection practice. Four empirically and contextually substantiated chronological intersections of the selection-period of practice are compared: The first intersection covers the establishment of the patrol in the beginning of the 1950s. The second intersection covers the span of years from the 1960s to 1990, during which a basic selection practice was developed and institutionalized. The third intersection covers a ten-year span from 1990 to the millennium. Several noteworthy changes in the selection took place in this period. The forth intersection describes the current selection practice and puts the selection process in perspective. The investigation documents a significant evolution in selection practices over time. What began as an intuitive selection of the first patrol has become a comprehensive and systematic approach, but the basic concern remains the same. Duty in the Arctic is no picnic. A successful recruit must have \\u2018the right stuff\\u2019. From a testing perspective in sociological historical optics, it appears that societal and cultural trends have influenced the selection indicators and goals, and more elements have gradually been added to the testing procedure. A discretionary assessment made on the basis of Sirius participants\\u2019 experiences appears always to have been part of the selection. Psychological testing, a significant breakthrough, was added to the selection process in the late 1960s and it has played a prominent role ever since. During the 1990s, physical testing became a third decisive parameter of the selection process.

Selection practices in The Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, an elite military unit in the Arctic 1950\\u20132015This article investigates the development of the selection practice for the Danish Army\\u2019s Sirius unit. The dog sled patrol protects the sovereignty of the realm and maintains surveillance in Northeast Greenland by patrolling the uninhabited national park. The investigation is primarily based on interviews with former, retired and current managers of the unit, as well as psychologists involved in the selection practice. Four empirically and contextually substantiated chronological intersections of the selection-period of practice are compared: The first intersection covers the establishment of the patrol in the beginning of the 1950s. The second intersection covers the span of years from the 1960s to 1990, during which a basic selection practice was developed and institutionalized. The third intersection covers a ten-year span from 1990 to the millennium. Several noteworthy changes in the selection took place in this period. The forth intersection describes the current selection practice and puts the selection process in perspective. The investigation documents a significant evolution in selection practices over time. What began as an intuitive selection of the first patrol has become a comprehensive and systematic approach, but the basic concern remains the same. Duty in the Arctic is no picnic. A successful recruit must have \\u2018the right stuff\\u2019. From a testing perspective in sociological historical optics, it appears that societal and cultural trends have influenced the selection indicators and goals, and more elements have gradually been added to the testing procedure. A discretionary assessment made on the basis of Sirius participants\\u2019 experiences appears always to have been part of the selection. Psychological testing, a significant breakthrough, was added to the selection process in the late 1960s and it has played a prominent role ever since. During the 1990s, physical testing became a third decisive parameter of the selection process. This process is currently terminated with a test that assesses both psychic robustness and physical endurance. On the basis of the testing literature it may be added that measurement indicators and the testing itself have a formative influence on the recruits. Seen in this light, the article concludes that if the men are indeed made of the right stuff, to a certain extent this is so because they are constructed as an elite by the comprehensive selection

The concept of organizational culture has been a necessary factor in improving health care because it can support or hinder the work of nursing stuff in the hospital. Therefore, this descriptive cross sectional survey study was designed to evaluate the organizational culture traits in Al-Basel Hospital and Majd Abdulla Hospital (classified as independent Trusts) in the city of Tartous, from the point of view of nursing stuff selected by convenient sampling from different departments (n=411). Denison Organization Culture Survey (DOCS) questionnaire was distributed to all participants. The results showed that the prevailing organizational cultural trait was adaptability (65%), followed by involvement (63%), consistency (62.4%), and the lowest trait was mission (49.6%). The study recommended the need to enhance important organizational culture traits in hospitals which contribute to improving the health care environment such as consistency and mission traits. In addition, conducting similar studies on a larger scale involving more hospitals and using different instrumentations would also improve the understanding of organizational culture.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0633\\u0644\\u0633\\u0644\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0644\\u0648\\u0645 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0635\\u062d\\u064a\\u0629 Print ISSN: 2079-309X, Online ISSN:2663-4287; Vol 41, No 1 (2019): \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0644\\u0648\\u0645 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0635\\u062d\\u064a\\u0629\",\"year\":\"2019-03-08\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Alio, Rula; Bador, Adnan; Ahmad, Reham\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.tishreen.edu.sy\\/index.php\\/hlthscnc\\/article\\/view\\/8436\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"8730107cbc65f5ee0f1198a89bd08cbd13974f603f86f1ee59d8e2695b105f19\",\"relevance\":74},{\"id\":\"3addd8e84ac42b1c75dea2fd7ee3c665867ddd76af924a87f1eb197e2cbde8c0\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.2365072; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2365073; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2365073; oai:zenodo.org:2365073\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2365073; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2365073\",\"title\":\"DETERMINATION OF INDUCTIVITY OF MOIST SKIN\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Modern Ukrainian market is formed under the influence of many interrelated factors, each of which in an appropriate situation can both stimulate and restrain its development, Main factors of the market include the volume and structure of domestic production and import, state of the market of raw materials and stuff, the number of people, etc. Electrical properties of capillary-porous systems are uniguely determined by the amount and type of moisture connection in the capillaries and pores with the main material of the substanse. Knowing the dependence of electrical characteristics of humidity, you can quickly get Information about the listribution of moisture in the material, which is imhortant for a namber of technological processes. In this work, the research was carried out to establish the relationship between the dielectric constant of f material and its moisture content, since for wet leather, general formulas that determine the dielectric constant \\u03b5(t) are unsuitable because, along with the mechanical filling of capillaries, water is bound, i.e. water is introduced into the collagen micelles.The measurements made in the work in order to establish porosity statistics were carried out on the Samples of leather of various types of various types of tanning \\u2013 chromium, combined and syntan. In the article, theoretical dependences of dielectric permeability on reciprocal of the pore radius (1\\/rm) are presented, on which, at the time scale connection, experimental points \\u03b5(t) are identically located. Calculations show that the wetting angle of natural leather is close to 90\\u00b0, which is generally confirmed by literary results. Studying the dependence of \\u03b5(t) for the samples of natyral leather, with multiplewetting shows that the chosen model qualitatively characterizes electrical properties of leather and can be used for practical calculations of such properties as air permeability, impregnation kinetics and others, which is very important for solving practical problems.\",\"published_in\":\"PROGRESSIVE TECHNIQUE AND TECHNOLOGIES OF FOOD PRODUCTION ENTERPRISES, CATERING BUSINESS AND TRADE 2 (28) 278-291\",\"year\":\"2018-12-17\",\"subject_orig\":\"raw materials; stuff; dielectric; permeability; reversible radius value; wetting angle\",\"subject\":\"raw materials; stuff; dielectric; permeability; reversible radius value; wetting angle\",\"authors\":\"V.

Adaptability is concerned with the capacity to adjust or be adjusted to suit new situations. A building as a composition separated in to a number of layers (site, structure, skin, space layout, services, stuff, social, surrounding) that together define building as a whole. Each layer is distinguished from others by special role it fulfills. According to previous studies, there are six types of adaptability that users \\u2018demands; adjustable, versatile, refitable, convertible, scalable and movable, can be linked to building layers through building design strategies and characteristics. This research will examine adaptability through analysis of office buildings according to their layers, to show ratio of adaptability in both public and private office buildings and explore needs of users for each type of changes. The aim of the research is to bring needed clarity to the concept of adaptability by providing more detail insight into what constitutes adaptability is in Erbil office buildings and the factors that give rise to different level of adaptability. For analyses of case studies using meta-model methodology of Robert S. and Simon A (2016). It showed that the average percentage of adaptability is half of total characteristics of building and the need for types of change are increasing in both public and private office building. For feasibility of building the problem mostly in layers such as spaces ,space plan, services ,stuff and structure.

In this study the authors also use research steps that can make research more systematic, accurate and have a good analysis of this study. Yusuf Al-Qaradhawi who forbids the sale and purchase which contains elements of fraud and elements of legal wrongdoing is haram. The reason given by Yusuf Al-Qaradhawi about the prohibition of buying and selling that contains these elements is so that no party is harmed because Islam justifies everything that is good.\",\"published_in\":\"ISLAMIC BUSSINESS LAW REVIEW; Vol 2, No 1 (2019): Juli-Desember 2019 ; 2337-4241\",\"year\":\"2019-12-23\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Julianti, Sri\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.uinsu.ac.id\\/index.php\\/iblr\\/article\\/view\\/6512\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"899326c2f3f4b33f2c6cbb9e92aed0a8a6f7ab5311a682732e89721bc1ea32f4\",\"relevance\":71},{\"id\":\"7bccadd91650c20e42ae1d88863fe4d58fc6e970e5129072c0a98c7c0d11fa61\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.2227799; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2227800; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2227800; oai:zenodo.org:2227800\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/2227800; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.2227800\",\"title\":\"ROLE OF ULTRASOUND IN SCREENING OF DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP JOINT IN THE NEONATES (DDH) IN ONE CENTER IN BURAIDAH CITY, SAUDI ARABIA.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: DDH most common orthopedic disorder in babies that detected in the newborn period or after 9 months, clicking sound when baby move their legs apart, it's an early sign of DDH.

Finding alternative insecticides to those because of their inefficiency pollute the environment and poison consumers is an emergency. An ethno-botanical survey conducted with about 300 farmers in the Far North region of Cameroon identified 15 local plants insecticides associated with food during storage in combination with two or three others. Among these plants, the most used are Hyptis spicigera (Lamiaceae) 78%, Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) 76.6% and Vepris heterophylla (Rutaceae) 28,33% which is more used in mountain area. The powders of these single plants are insecticides on T. castaneum, however A. indica single or in combination with H. spicigera gives better insecticidal efficacy 73.33% and 66.67% mortality respectively.Keywords: Tribolium castaneum, stocked food stuff, combination, vegetal powder, insecticide\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Biological and Chemical Sciences; Vol 13, No 3 (2019); 1613-1620 ; 1997-342X ; 1991-8631\",\"year\":\"2019-09-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"Tribolium castaneum; stocked food stuff; combination; vegetal powder; insecticide\",\"subject\":\"Tribolium castaneum; stocked food stuff; combination; vegetal powder; insecticide\",\"authors\":\"Ayiki, Ev\\u00e9l\\u00e9 Nathanael; Tamgno, B\\u00e9ranger Raoul; Madou, Chantal; Vatsou, J\\u00e9r\\u00e9mie; Ngassoum, Martin Benoit; Ngamo Tinkeu, L\\u00e9onard Simon\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.ajol.info\\/index.php\\/ijbcs\\/article\\/view\\/189643\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"840109fdfe598e4a04bf6256b6346c30a24ccdd6fce7998be5bcf903030fd841\",\"relevance\":68},{\"id\":\"9fb1c6872b573975c1525fc0305bd7df27aaddd00a79fcf8e4ed77ad3b952f83\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ejournal.unitomo.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jsk\\/article\\/view\\/1681; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2549-7294; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2549-7626; 2549-7294; 2549-7626; doi:10.25139\\/jsk.v3i3.1681; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/48b621413d0f4583bd0fdf36502e9043\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25139\\/jsk.v3i3.1681; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/48b621413d0f4583bd0fdf36502e9043\",\"title\":\"Paparan selektif penggunaan fitur senyap dan teman dekat pada twitter dan instagram\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Social media has become a part of human\\u2019s life.

Not only that but users can also choose their friends, what kind of content they want to see, what kind of relationship then want to have, or to keep certain content just for a few people to see through social media. A few features like mute feature to close friends feature are there for users to use on Twitter and Instagram. This research will try to find out how those features are being used by the users and why those features are needed. In depth interview is used to six informants who use the mute and close friend feature on Twitter or Instagram. Selective exposure theory is used to see how someone is more interested in seeing contents that match their believes and interests. It shows that mute feature is used to filter some stuff that they want to see and avoid things they don\\u2019t like. The mute feature also useful for keeping the relationship in a good term between the users and other people.

The employment of such labels will shape how the young person is perceived by the adults surrounding them. This will not only have an impact on the relationships that are developed between the pupil and the educator but also how the young people see themselves in terms of their own identity. This paper seeks to give voice and explore the position of young people within the confines of their educational experiences. The paper draws on 13 in-depth case studies to reflect on how young people experience the SEBD labels attached to them by others and what pupils consider to be the main antecedents leading them to display behaviour which is deemed unacceptable in the classroom. The paper highlights the importance of providing opportunities for young people to have their voice heard to fill the gap between professional perceptions and those of the pupil. In order to truly understand why young people display behaviour that is considered difficult and how they experience the labels we attach to them we have to speak to young people themselves.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-03-07\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Caslin, Marie\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hira.hope.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/2766\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"30218cb2ac268dbe43d3d0a62594a56a3a9f02d0e8061dad6106074f7bf7b744\",\"relevance\":65},{\"id\":\"d2bc1e51f09ed4072288b4bb9479d3126245fa39ff938fb42900db41edd5f584\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/pure.fak.dk\\/da\\/publications\\/ambivalent-anticipations(02ab2bbc-b616-4c60-9f11-57ba08387f3b).html; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3167\\/cja.2019.370107\",\"title\":\"Ambivalent Anticipations:On Soldierly Becomings in the Desert of the Real\",\"paper_abstract\":\"What if war is not hell?

Modern world leaders are already actively preparing for a new era \\u2013 the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is based on the concept of fully networked and adaptive production with intelligent systems. However, in order to use the full potential of it, changes in the labor market are needed in accordance with changing requirements and, since it is people who are the key success factors. Purpose. The purpose of the article is to study the impact of Fourth Industrial Revolution in the global industry on the staff of the enterprise. Results. The universal nature of the new industrial model proposed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, opens up the opportunity for a new industrial revolution, as a result of which the Fourth Industrial Revolution will become a new global industrial milestone and a standard for the development of the real sector of the economy all over the world. The future is for superprofessional skills and abilities. These skills are universal and important for specialists in various industries. Mastering them allows the employee to increase the efficiency of professional activity in industry, and also makes it possible to move between sectors, while maintaining his relevance. The FIR will affect absolutely all industries, but our research is devoted to new professions in the industry. Accordingly, through the prism of industry, we will consider changes in the professions. The most significant changes are expected in robotics and engineering. The following occupations are expected: Industrial robotics designer, Designer ergonomist, Operator of multifunctional robotic systems, Engineer composer, Home robots\\u2019 designer, Medical robots\\u2019 designer, Child robot\\u2019s designer and Robots neurointerface designer. At the intersection of management and production may cause such professions: Production coordinator in distributed communities, Trendvotcher \\/ Forsyter, Cross-cultural communication manager, Moderator user communities, Online sales manager. Conclusion. The Fourth industrial revolution will substantially change all spheres of life, including professional ones. As the study showed, the future of interdisciplinary professions. Employees get many benefits and comfort with a new way of working, but learning will be needed during a professional life, so the company needs strong partners. For a successful path to FIR, there are a variety of opportunities for lifelong learning and organization of work that contributes to learning. Both professional and academic training require a continuous dialogue between industry, politics and society to constantly evolve and adapt.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-04\",\"subject_orig\":\"Fourth industrial revolution; stuff; superprofessional skills; robotics; engineering\",\"subject\":\"Fourth industrial revolution; stuff; superprofessional skills; robotics; engineering\",\"authors\":\"\\u0411\\u0430\\u0448\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u043a\\u0430\\u044f, \\u0406\\u0440\\u0438\\u043d\\u0430 \\u041e\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0441\\u0430\\u043d\\u0434\\u0440\\u0456\\u0432\\u043d\\u0430; \\u0422\\u0440\\u0443\\u0445\\u0430\\u0447\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430, \\u0421\\u043e\\u0444\\u0456\\u044f \\u041b\\u0435\\u043e\\u043d\\u0456\\u0434\\u0456\\u0432\\u043d\\u0430; Bashynska, I.

Secondly, to assess the quality of aSCR evidence for the Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH) during the IGT. Finally, to evaluate the reliability of current psychophysiological measurements on the IGT. Electronic databases, journals and reference lists were examined for inclusion. Data were extracted by two reviewers and validated by another reviewer, using a standardised extraction sheet along with a quality assessment. Two meta-analyses of aSCR measures were conducted to test the relationship between overall aSCR and IGT performance, and differences in aSCR between advantageous and disadvantageous decks. Twenty studies were included in this review. Quality assessment revealed that five studies did not measure anticipatory responses, and few stated they followed standard IGT and\\/or psychophysiological procedures. The first meta-analysis of 15 studies revealed a significant, small-to-medium relationship between aSCR and IGT performance (r= .22). The second meta-analysis of eight studies revealed a significant, small difference in aSCR between the advantageous and disadvantageous decks (r= .10); however, publication bias is likely to be an issue. Meta-analyses revealed aSCR evidence supporting the SMH. However, inconsistencies in the IGT and psychophysiological methods, along with publication bias, cast doubt on these effects. It is recommended that future tests of the SMH use a range of psychophysiological measures, a standardised IGT protocol, and discriminate between advantageous and disadvantageous decks. ; N\\/A\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-09-06\",\"subject_orig\":\"Decision-making; Emotion; Reward\",\"subject\":\"Decision-making; Emotion; Reward\",\"authors\":\"Simonovic, Boban; Stupple, Edward J.

Using classic Delphi technique and pairwise comparison, the components were given to 32 specialists in emergency medicine, nuclear medicine, medical physics, nuclear physics, radiobiology and radiation protection, health in disaster and emergency, and passive defense. Finally, the national model was developed by holding two focus group sessions.Results: The results from the two rounds of Delphi technique showed that 31 factors of preparedness were classified into three main classes, namely staff, stuff, and structure (system). Only three factors were excluded and the rest were agreed upon by the specialists. Given the weight of each class, it was found that staff preparedness and stuff preparedness had the highest and lowest priorities, respectively.Conclusion: Comprehensive preparedness requires enhancing and promoting cultural, social, economic, and political levels. Indeed, all preparedness levels should be promoted in alignment with each other.

Aim: From September 2017, representatives of seven regional emergency medical centers in Seoul met monthly and decided to investigate basic data for the future establishment of surge capacity planning. Methods: Staff, supply, space, and systems for surge capacity were surveyed in seven hospitals. The additional surveyed data were as follows: hospital incident command system and actual operational experience; performance of disaster drill; safety and security plan; estimation of surge capacity in normal operating conditions and extreme operating conditions; alternative therapeutic spaces; back-up plan to call non-duty medical staff; decontamination equipment; contingency plan for stuff shortage; etc. Results: All the hospitals reported they have hospital incident command systems and held disaster drills every year, however, the two hospitals (28.5%) had no real experience of hospital incident command system activation. Five hospitals (71.4%) did not have a safety and security plan. They replied they can treat average 7.7 emergency patients (Korean Triage and Acute scale (KTAS) \\u2264 3), 10 non-emergent patients (KTAS&gt;4), 0.9 surgical patients and 0.7 unstable patients simultaneously in normal operating conditions. In extreme operating conditions, they replied they can treat average 26.4 emergency patients (KTAS \\u2264 3), 54.3 non-emergent patients (KTAS&gt;4), 37 surgical patients and 2.3 unstable patients simultaneously. The two hospitals (28.5%) had no alternative therapeutic spaces, no back-up plan to call non-duty medical staff and no contingency plan for stuff shortage. Three hospitals (42.9%) did not have decontamination equipment. Discussion: The survey revealed the basic data for surge capacity planning in Seoul. Data from hospitals other than regional emergency medical centers should be collected for the completion of disaster plans.\",\"published_in\":\"Prehospital and Disaster Medicine ; volume 34, issue s1, page s158-s159 ; ISSN 1049-023X 1945-1938\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Yoon, Young-hoon; Kim, Jung-Youn; Heo, Gwang-ryol; Sim, Bo-Sun; Moon, Sung-Woo\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s1049023x19003583\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"4921c10cd5a07234cf351d00387dc92dcfd4c5420eb46c357f5e13bbc3cf7ae1\",\"relevance\":59},{\"id\":\"550ab1a2b9b9f4a620ec8e9368ea72b5595aa2f53cf58f19f1450b9b7a16dd1e\",\"relation\":\"\\u0412\\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u043d\\u0438\\u043a \\u0423\\u0440\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u0441\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0433\\u043e\\u0441\\u0443\\u0434\\u0430\\u0440\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043c\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438\\u0446\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0443\\u043d\\u0438\\u0432\\u0435\\u0440\\u0441\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u0442\\u0430. 2019. \\u21161; \\u0420\\u043e\\u043b\\u044c \\u0441\\u043e\\u0437\\u0434\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f \\u0443\\u0447\\u0435\\u0431\\u043d\\u044b\\u0445 \\u0444\\u0438\\u043b\\u044c\\u043c\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0432 \\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u043c \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0446\\u0435\\u0441\\u0441\\u0435 \\/ \\u0410. \\u0410. \\u0413\\u0435\\u0440\\u0430\\u0441\\u0438\\u043c\\u043e\\u0432, \\u041b. \\u0410. \\u0415\\u043c\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u044f\\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430, \\u041e. \\u0421. \\u0421\\u0442\\u0430\\u0440\\u043e\\u0434\\u0443\\u0431\\u0446\\u0435\\u0432\\u0430 [\\u0438 \\u0434\\u0440.] \\/\\/ \\u0412\\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u043d\\u0438\\u043a \\u0423\\u0440\\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u0441\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0433\\u043e\\u0441\\u0443\\u0434\\u0430\\u0440\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043c\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438\\u0446\\u0438\\u043d\\u0441\\u043a\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u0443\\u043d\\u0438\\u0432\\u0435\\u0440\\u0441\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u0442\\u0430. \\u2014 2019. \\u2014 \\u2116 1. \\u2014 \\u0421. 11-13.; 2500-0667; http:\\/\\/elib.usma.ru\\/handle\\/usma\\/1320\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/elib.usma.ru\\/handle\\/usma\\/1320\",\"title\":\"\\u0420\\u043e\\u043b\\u044c \\u0441\\u043e\\u0437\\u0434\\u0430\\u043d\\u0438\\u044f \\u0443\\u0447\\u0435\\u0431\\u043d\\u044b\\u0445 \\u0444\\u0438\\u043b\\u044c\\u043c\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0432 \\u043e\\u0431\\u0440\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0432\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u043c \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0446\\u0435\\u0441\\u0441\\u0435 ; The role of educational films creating in the learning experiences\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The students\\u2019 initiative in the educational films creation improves the assimilation of material on the \\\"Disaster Medicine\\\" stuff.

The challenge that a new sociology of testing must address is that ubiquitous testing changes the relations between science, engineering and sociology: Engineering is today in the very stuff of where society happens. It is not that the tests of 21st Century engineering occur within a social context but that it is the very fabric of the social that is being put to the test.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sociology;

We recognize materials from shape, color and texture features. This paper is a selective review and discussion of how artists have been using shape features to evoke vivid impressions of specific materials and material properties. A number of examples are presented in which visual artists render materials or their transformations, such as soft human skin, runny or viscous fluids, or wrinkled cloth. They achieve this by expressing the telltale shape features of these materials and transformations, often by carving them from a single block of marble or wood.

However, it is unclear from the literature what exactly information sharing is and why it is important to institutional performance. This paper seeks to deconstruct the concept of information sharing, particularly within aspects of the supply chain. We shall argue that the central problem with the concept of information sharing is that it relies on a notion of information as stuff that can be manipulated, transmitted, and used in an unproblematic manner between organizations. We wish to question conventional notions of this construct by examining and analyzing a case of information sharing, applicable within an international supply chain, as well as several problems experienced with such sharing. Through deconstructing this case we demonstrate how certain perceived problems in information sharing are better conceptualized as breakdowns in the interinstitutional scaffolding of data structures.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-04-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Beynon-Davies, Paul; Wang, Yingli\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/orca.cf.ac.uk\\/122145\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"a269cbd70ee9be809e8fa273e99b8316d95580965607e8b6f80e7fbedf517990\",\"relevance\":42},{\"id\":\"ce043706bbd808df589084e1410172caed136de57bbb18f5c1dc0b81b00607bf\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.openedition.org\\/lirico\\/8650; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2262-8339; 2262-8339; doi:10.4000\\/lirico.8650; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e3af3831d4244c4ebfd760e5d7586230\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.4000\\/lirico.8650; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e3af3831d4244c4ebfd760e5d7586230\",\"title\":\"Vacilante vida escrita del novelista argentino.

We wish to pursue in this study that, beyond technological considerations, it is necessary to expand the scope of child protection by establishing mutual collaboration between regulators, distributors and video on demand services, as well as consumers and parents\\u2019 organisations, in an effort to further enhance cooperation and mutual understanding (European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, 2017b, p. 75). It is for this reason that we believe that the academic sphere can also be invited into this wide-ranging discussion on child protection to contribute reflections on a key aspect: audiovisual and media education, an essential pillar of protection in addition to filters, external limits, and electronic labelling. We thus uphold a vision that not only considers the \\u201cdigital stuff\\u201d but also highlights the need for \\u201cethos stuff\\u201d (Goggin, 2008, p.89). In this respect, we have considered it essential a literature review on the concept of media literacy. Secondly, our qualitative methodology involves an analysis of the instructions issued by the European Union and their implementation in Spain. In this stage, we have conducted desk research based on a narrative analysis of the documents and programs of different institutions in order to chart the evolution of the question in recent years, at a time when the digital environment has changed more quickly than ever before. This same type of analysis is also conducted on the initiatives of European and Spanish companies to determine whether they are implementing child protection strategies.\",\"published_in\":\"Comunica\\u00e7\\u00e3o e Sociedade; vol. 37 (2020): Crian\\u00e7as, jovens e media: perspetivas atuais; 127-146 ; Comunica\\u00e7\\u00e3o e Sociedade; Vol 37 (2020): Children, youth and media: current perspectives; 127-146 ; 2183-3575 ; 1645-2089\",\"year\":\"2020-06-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Labio-Bernal, Aurora; Romero-Dom\\u00ednguez, Lorena R.; Garc\\u00eda-Orta, Mar\\u00eda Jos\\u00e9\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/revistacomsoc.pt\\/article\\/view\\/2162\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"30f64dcb81b4affcaa85bc6518ff2c02fb7f6b7c5bb47a803a186d50c17c8c96\",\"relevance\":36},{\"id\":\"4a894a38365387aa51dcfc843edddfe082de68d15f6087672101d49036225093\",\"relation\":\"Trends in Ecology & Evolution; 33; 9; 2018-09; 651-652; 10.1016\\/j.tree.2017.12.010; non; https:\\/\\/basepub.dauphine.fr\\/handle\\/123456789\\/20752\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/basepub.dauphine.fr\\/handle\\/123456789\\/20752\",\"title\":\"A Final Warning to Planet Earth\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In Ripple et al.

In two undergraduate samples (N = 248, 183), the current study assessed the extent to which various forms of insecurity (i.e., low self-esteem, public self-consciousness, relative deprivation, anxious attachment, fear of death) mediate the relationship between the Buddhist construct of nonattachment and materialism. In line with expectations, greater nonattachment was directly associated with reduced materialism in both samples. Nonattachment was also found to be indirectly associated with reduced materialism via reduced public self-consciousness and relative deprivation. Self-esteem, anxious attachment, and fear of death did not mediate the relationship between nonattachment and materialism. The findings therefore indicate that the acceptance and non-contingent sense of self typical of nonattachment may play an important role in minimising the experience or impact of insecurity that can contribute to materialism, as well as minimising the importance placed on material goals.\",\"published_in\":\"Personality and Individual Differences, Vol. 149 (Oct 2019), pp. 302-308\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Elphinstone, Brad; Whitehead, Richard\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/450037\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"b8d519e1b6592016efba965ac790aa7ac528b59c2f7fa309d3761778a1c41dd9\",\"relevance\":33},{\"id\":\"3544813e3a8ec079975e31a1e19fe663c9d28ffa7ffa846a94c8782a4e72267c\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.isi-dps.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jomsti\\/article\\/view\\/965\\/456; http:\\/\\/jurnal.isi-dps.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jomsti\\/article\\/view\\/965\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.isi-dps.ac.id\\/index.php\\/jomsti\\/article\\/view\\/965\",\"title\":\"MERLOT: Belajar Musik di Era Digital\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article is a literature review on MERLOT (Multimedia Education Resources for Online Learning and Teaching), an open-source multimedia-based learning resource for asynchronous music learning needs.

This paper shifts the focus from the stuff that is being positioned as money to the social totality. Credit theorists claim that commodity theories of money imply monetary neutrality and a primacy of real analysis. In contrast, this paper argues based on Marx and Smith that, independently of whether money is a commodity or credit, the necessity of money depends on the constitution of the economy in terms of the relation between production and circulation. If social production is constituted through the exchange between private specialised producers, money is not neutral but essential. For Smith, real analysis is nevertheless meaningful, in that, he treats the spheres of exchange and production separately. By contrast, Marx exposes real analysis as commodity fetishism and stresses the mutually constitutive social relations between money, commodity exchange and capitalist production.\",\"published_in\":\"Cambridge Journal of Economics ; volume 43, issue 6, page 1459-1483 ; ISSN 0309-166X 1464-3545\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Economics and Econometrics\",\"subject\":\"Economics and Econometrics\",\"authors\":\"Weber, Isabella M\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/cje\\/bez038\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8b0e29cbc015cdc92c3e96f45717403dd2049d953fabe2acad6e8f8c337b818d\",\"relevance\":21},{\"id\":\"25d33697fd267200cc494681ad18d7e818f959a02b38809fb87b0b243f9575f6\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/632207; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/ijoks\\/issue\\/42771\\/502201; doi:10.21600\\/ijoks.502201\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/ijoks\\/issue\\/42771\\/502201; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.21600\\/ijoks.502201\",\"title\":\"H\\u00eenkirina R\\u00eazimana Kurmanc\\u00ee di nav konteks\\u00ea de\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Teachinggrammar in language teaching process is a challenging and time taking period.For an easier and better teaching, teaching grammar in a context is ofsignificant importance in many respects and facilitates teaching.

Method: In this review article, we structured the current advancements in the preparation methods and attributes of QDs. Furthermore, we extend an overview of the outstanding potential of QDs for biomedical research and radical approaches to drug delivery. Conclusion: Notably, the applications of QDs as smart next-generation nanosystems for neuroscience and pharmacokinetic studies have been explained.

They may have experienced history in school as learning stuff that doesn't seem relevant.\",\"published_in\":\"The Americas ; volume 76, issue 3, page 401-413 ; ISSN 0003-1615 1533-6247\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Cultural Studies; History\",\"subject\":\"Cultural Studies; History\",\"authors\":\"Stern, Steve J.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/tam.2019.35\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"fa91cd8f16508312de5f4b3b54127fac646c7dfdcdf12e4093c08f2bd162ee9e\",\"relevance\":9},{\"id\":\"5d0a6bc08ed37c568ad5909df0989310cfcabb8e2d1efc574a2bdfdc7b5aa7b2\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.repository.cam.ac.uk\\/handle\\/1810\\/303853; doi:10.17863\\/CAM.50935\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.repository.cam.ac.uk\\/handle\\/1810\\/303853; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17863\\/CAM.50935\",\"title\":\"Such stuff as dreams are made on: John Bowlby and the interpretation of dreams\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this paper, newly uncovered archival material from the Bowlby archives is presented on Bowlby\\u2019s own dreams and dream interpretation. Although he was critical of orthodox psychoanalysis, Bowlby appears to have been seriously involved in Freudian dream interpretation in the 1930s and 1940s. Here, we present in annotated form his own interpretations of several of his dreams from that time and a series of lectures on dreams. In Attachment and Loss, classic dream interpretation is absent and Bowlby used the content of dreams as a reflection of the influence of real-life experiences on the representations of attachment relations, with a clear focus on grief, loss, and mourning.

The evidence suggests that MNEs engaged in both union suppression and union substitution strategies by (i) exploiting young employees' apathy to promote opposition and indifference for union organisation (evil stuff), (ii) implementing union member-centred employee retrenchment (fear stuff), (iii) using enterprise-level collective bargaining arrangement to suppress union bargaining power (fear and fatal stuff), (iv) exploiting the fragmented labour union environment to suppress union organisation (fatal and evil stuff) and (v) promoting individual employee voice and involvement mechanisms (sweet stuff).

Indriyasana Kindergarten Babadan is a school that uses educational game stuff as one of the learning media. It is required to continually maintain this educational game stuff including its storage in order to enhance this learning method. However, there is a problem faced by Indriyasana Kindergarten Babadan that is the school does not have cupboards to keep its educational game stuff. This community service program implements ergonomic scientific\\/field to design a cupboard to keep educational game stuff based on anthropometry of teachers in Indriyasana Kindergarten Babadan. The result of this program was to design three kinds of cupboards.

My expectancy to this text is to incorporate into the study of material culture the interference of things as well as stuff into the record and archaeological practices. Recent studies of material culture emphasizes the meaning of things as well as stuff and start from the idea that they can be perceived and seen as signs that help their owners and users in their communicative processes, and in the formation of identities. I believe that perceiving these processes as a dynamic network of interrelations will help establish accurate and participatory phenomenological connections with other members of society, and better understand the symmetrical relationships between people, things, and stuff. ; Este ensaio espera tratar das qualidades da cultura material e das subst\\u00e2ncias, as comunicativas e as expressivas, independentemente de qualquer limite cronol\\u00f3gico e atrav\\u00e9s de um di\\u00e1logo interdisciplinar com arque\\u00f3logos, antrop\\u00f3logos, historiadores, soci\\u00f3logos, economistas, psic\\u00f3logos e fil\\u00f3sofos.

Superflab, Super Stuff pink wax and Paraffin wax bolus materials are used with 15MeV electron energy for dosimetric comparison. Additionally, 10 mm thick Super Stuff pink wax bolus and paraffin wax bolus materials were placed on the right eyelid of a patient. Using electron dose calculation algorithm and ion chamber measurements, dosimetric comparisons were made in the Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS). Both for measured and calculated dose, values were acquired 3 times and averaged for each case. Resulting differences are expressed as percentage differences. Dose differences were obtained in measurements with and without using bolus at several locations of the solid phantom, performed by the Roos Ion chamber. Dosimetric differences of 7-7.5% for Superflab, 10-10.5% for paraffin bolus and 13-14% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus are obtained. Besides, when dosimetric comparisons are made in the treatment planning system for cases with and without bolus; Dose differences were calculated to be 2-2.5% for superflab silicon bolus, 3-3.5% for paraffin wax bolus and 5-6% for Super Stuff pink wax bolus. To increase skin dose in curved anatomical structures in radiotherapy, it is safe to use the paraffin wax bolus material in radiotherapy clinic, as an alternative to Superflab silicon bolus and Super Stuff pink wax bolus materials, due to its low cost and ease of conforming to body surface contours.

Hence, the English contemporary political theatre has displayed unique interconnectedness between drama and politics: interest in US-Iraq war is indeed not an exception. British playwright, David Hare, belongs to a trend of war drama that enables the world to witness the truth, trauma and the violence of US-Iraq war. Stuff Happens subtly helps show how US coercive diplomacy manipulates other Powers to fulfill the new doctrine of \\\" New American Century.\\\" In Stuff Happens, Hare documents the recent tragic history of Iraq in such an approach that blends the documentary with the fictional to display the events from 2000, till the actual invasion of Iraq in April, 2003.

By unpacking and applying Giorgio Agamben\\u2019s writing on the State of Exception to post-truth political performances, Alex D. Wilson discusses in this article how political deception is an exceptional act of sovereign power and how the state of exception is an inherently performative phenomenon. The inherent challenges this state of affairs presents to the theatre are discussed with particular reference to David Hare\\u2019s Stuff Happens (2004), which, it is argued, falls into its own state of exception in terms of its approach to truth.

Ennio Morricone, who died in July this year, was one of a handful of composers in film history who could comfortably claim to be one of the latter: from the moment he shot to international prominence in the 1960s, cinema has always been and will always be part Morricone. He wrote more than 500 film and television scores over the course of a 60-year career; he redefined ossified cinematic genres; and perhaps most toweringly of all, with his collaborations with director Sergio Leone, he composed some of the few snatches of film music that are easily recognised by those who do not easily recognise film music.

In the cosmogonic explanation of the origin of the earth and the heavenly bodies, the Greek term \\u1f00\\u03ae\\u03c1 turns out to mean rather \\u2018opaque damp mist\\u2019. However, Not only does it accord with archaic usage, but also with how it was used in his mentor, Anaximander. Yet, in cosmology \\u1f00\\u03ae\\u03c1 means \\u2018air\\u2019 serving as stuff on which the earth and the heavenly bodies float. Hence, in keeping with contemporary usage, Anaximenes recognised two kinds of \\u1f00\\u03ae\\u03c1, distinguishing them functionally. Whereas mist is conceived of as a generating substance, air functions only as carrying stuff.

Therefore, interventions that promote sexual health and reduce risk are critical to develop for these couples. Given the disproportionate burden of HIV among populations of color, it is also critical that these interventions are culturally congruent. The EBAN intervention for African American serodiscordant couples recognizes the centrality of culture in shap\\u00ading sexual behaviors and helps couples develop intimacy and positive prevention behaviors. The analytic objective of our study was to examine the knowledge and awareness gained by participants in the intervention. Participants: Participants (n=17) who com\\u00adpleted at least half of the eight intervention sessions. Methods: Brief post-implementation semi-structured interviews were conducted be\\u00adtween January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Team-based, targeted content analysis focused on knowledge and awareness gains. Results: Participants described learning about sexual health, expanded sexual options, and sexual communication. The \\u201cEBAN caf\\u00e9,\\u201d a component that gives couples a menu of options for safer sex behaviors, was particularly popular. Partici\\u00adpants also noted the value of learning how to communicate with one another about their sexual health-related concerns and preferences. They appreciated the \\u201ccultural stuff\\u201d that was infused throughout the ses\\u00adsions, including the emphasis on learning from one another as couples. Conclusions: Couples at risk for HIV trans\\u00admission benefit from strengthening skills and knowledge related to healthy sexual\\u00adity. A behavioral intervention that aligns with cultural values and imparts culturally congruent sexual health information appeals to couples who seek ways to enhance their intimacy and sexual options while also re\\u00adducing risk.

Using posts (n = 975) on Facebook pages and tweets (n = 889) on Twitter handles of Stuff.co.nz and NZHerald.co.nz from 12 November to 17 November, we analysed how media users reacted to breaking news coverage of a major natural disaster. The results show that quake news gets significantly more interaction and reactions than non-quake news on both social media platforms. For Twitter, quake news gets significantly more interactions such as likes, and retweets, but not replies. However, for Facebook, quake news gets significantly more comments, likes, wows, and sad emotional feedbacks, but no significant difference in emotions such as love, haha, and angry. The emotions people have on Facebook indicate well the nature of the news. With Facebook\\u2019s new function of reactions including, like, love, haha, wow, sad, angry, makes reactions more expressive and relevant. The study also shows a clear pattern of reactions on the two social media platforms across the timeline.

Despite the community's efforts in data collection, there are still few image datasets covering a wide range of scenes and object categories with dense and detailed annotations for scene parsing. In this paper, we introduce and analyze the ADE20K dataset, spanning diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases even parts of parts. A scene parsing benchmark is built upon the ADE20K with 150 object and stuff classes included. Several segmentation baseline models are evaluated on the benchmark. A novel network design called Cascade Segmentation Module is proposed to parse a scene into stuff, objects, and object parts in a cascade and improve over the baselines. We further show that the trained scene parsing networks can lead to applications such as image content removal and scene synthesis. \\u00a92017 Paper presented at the 30th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017), July 21-26, 2017, Honolulu, Hawaii. ; NSF (grant no. 1524817)  MIT web domain Zhou, Bolei; Zhao, Hang; Puig Fernandez, Francesco Xavier; Fidler, Sanja; Barriuso, Adela; Torralba, Antonio\"},{\"id\":\"c3a982ad1ca353c721bd1687b52c1c1076178d21947514a02cf2a0118010043b\",\"content\":\"Wearables Meet IoT: Synergistic Personal Area Networks (SPANs) Wearable monitoring and mobile health (mHealth) revolutionized healthcare diagnostics and delivery, while the exponential increase of deployed \\u201cthings\\u201d in the Internet of things (IoT) transforms our homes and industries. \\u201cThings\\u201d with embedded activity and vital sign sensors that we refer to as \\u201csmart stuff\\u201d can interact with wearable and ambient sensors.

A deep understanding of the essence of the system approach to ensuring the quality of higher education requires the study of the best world practices. The article is aimed to analyze implementation strategies of quality assurance policy within Israeli system of higher education. The case of Israel illustrates implementation of a system for assessing and assuring quality standards in higher education that is recognized as one of the highest national priorities. Quality assurance at Israeli higher education institutions is regulated by The Quality Assessment and Assurance Division. Nevertheless, Israeli Council for Higher Education promotes culture of establishing internal mechanisms to assure academic quality. The case study of quality assurance strategies in Israeli higher education institutions was focused on the analysis of key activities managed by teaching and learning centers. These centers are dedicated to professional development of faculty members to promote learning outcome of study programs through innovative teaching methodologies. Missions and functions of the centers are based on common international standards. The spectrum of activities includes: professional development of teaching stuff (workshops for newly recruited both senior and junior stuff, and individual teaching consultations to senior stuff); technological and pedagogical support for curricula and course design (from lecture-based to fully online-courses support); implementation and integration of new technologies: particularly by scouting, absorbing and effectively implementing digital technologies; and conducting students\\u2019 teaching satisfaction surveys.

Drawing on the reading of scientific literature and a series of interviews with scientists working at the juncture of soil and climate research, this article pursues a picture that highlights soil's capacities to shape future climates, including by fostering major planetary tipping points; we elaborates on the cultural and ethical significance of that picture for opening up alternative stories in which agency and change are not human-only prerogatives.

In conversational data, the most frequent forms cited as examples of this category are or something , and everything , and things and and stuff , which are described as \\u2018coordination tags\\u2019 by Biber et al. (1999: 115\\u201316). This label has not been widely adopted, but the linguistic category it describes has clearly become established as part of modern English. The term \\u2018general extender\\u2019 (Overstreet, 1999) is now commonly used to refer to this category: \\u2018\\u201cgeneral\\u201d because they are nonspecific and \\u201cextender\\u201d because they extend otherwise complete utterances\\u2019 (1999: 3). There are two subcategories: adjunctive general extenders, beginning with and , and disjunctive general extenders, beginning with or . In casual conversation, general extenders are typically phrase- or clause-final, consisting of and\\/or plus a vague noun ( stuff\\/things ) or a pronoun ( something\\/everything ), with an optional comparative phrase ( like that\\/this ). In everyday spoken British English, the phrase and (all) that is also extremely common. In written and formal spoken English, forms with quite different structures, such as et cetera , and so on, and so forth , and or so are more typically used to fulfill related functions. All of these forms are grammatically optional and fall within the more general category of pragmatic markers, along with you know , I mean , like and sort of , \\u2018expressions which may have little obvious propositional meaning but which oil the wheels of conversational social interaction\\u2019 (Beeching, 2016: 1).

The goal of this study is to explore children\\u2019s practices, perceptions, and knowledge regarding passwords. Given the limited work to date and that the world\\u2019s cyber posture and culture will be dependent on today\\u2019s youth, it is imperative to conduct cyber-security research with children. We conducted surveys of 189 3rd to 8th graders from two Midwest schools in the USA. We found that children have on average two passwords for school and three to four passwords for home. They kept their passwords private and did not share with others. They created passwords with an average length of 7 (3rd to 5th graders) and 10 (6\\u20138th graders). But, only about 13% of the children created very strong passwords. Generating strong passwords requires mature cognitive and linguistic capabilities which children at this developmental stage have not yet mastered. They believed that passwords provide access control, protect their privacy and keep their \\u201cstuff\\u201d safe. Overall, children had appropriate mental models of passwords and demonstrated good password practices. Cyber-security education should strive to reinforce these positive practices while continuing to provide and promote age-appropriate developmental security skills. Given the study\\u2019s sample size and limited generalizability, we are expanding our research to include children from 3rd to 12th graders across multiple US school districts.

Psychological testing, a significant breakthrough, was added to the selection process in the late 1960s and it has played a prominent role ever since. During the 1990s, physical testing became a third decisive parameter of the selection process. This process is currently terminated with a test that assesses both psychic robustness and physical endurance. On the basis of the testing literature it may be added that measurement indicators and the testing itself have a formative influence on the recruits.

The concept of organizational culture has been a necessary factor in improving health care because it can support or hinder the work of nursing stuff in the hospital. Therefore, this descriptive cross sectional survey study was designed to evaluate the organizational culture traits in Al-Basel Hospital and Majd Abdulla Hospital (classified as independent Trusts) in the city of Tartous, from the point of view of nursing stuff selected by convenient sampling from different departments (n=411). Denison Organization Culture Survey (DOCS) questionnaire was distributed to all participants. The results showed that the prevailing organizational cultural trait was adaptability (65%), followed by involvement (63%), consistency (62.4%), and the lowest trait was mission (49.6%). The study recommended the need to enhance important organizational culture traits in hospitals which contribute to improving the health care environment such as consistency and mission traits. In addition, conducting similar studies on a larger scale involving more hospitals and using different instrumentations would also improve the understanding of organizational culture.  \\u0633\\u0644\\u0633\\u0644\\u0629 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0644\\u0648\\u0645 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0635\\u062d\\u064a\\u0629 Print ISSN: 2079-309X, Online ISSN:2663-4287; Vol 41, No 1 (2019): \\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0644\\u0648\\u0645 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0635\\u062d\\u064a\\u0629 Alio, Rula; Bador, Adnan; Ahmad, Reham\"},{\"id\":\"3addd8e84ac42b1c75dea2fd7ee3c665867ddd76af924a87f1eb197e2cbde8c0\",\"content\":\"DETERMINATION OF INDUCTIVITY OF MOIST SKIN Modern Ukrainian market is formed under the influence of many interrelated factors, each of which in an appropriate situation can both stimulate and restrain its development, Main factors of the market include the volume and structure of domestic production and import, state of the market of raw materials and stuff, the number of people, etc. Electrical properties of capillary-porous systems are uniguely determined by the amount and type of moisture connection in the capillaries and pores with the main material of the substanse.

Adaptability is concerned with the capacity to adjust or be adjusted to suit new situations. A building as a composition separated in to a number of layers (site, structure, skin, space layout, services, stuff, social, surrounding) that together define building as a whole. Each layer is distinguished from others by special role it fulfills. According to previous studies, there are six types of adaptability that users \\u2018demands; adjustable, versatile, refitable, convertible, scalable and movable, can be linked to building layers through building design strategies and characteristics. This research will examine adaptability through analysis of office buildings according to their layers, to show ratio of adaptability in both public and private office buildings and explore needs of users for each type of changes. The aim of the research is to bring needed clarity to the concept of adaptability by providing more detail insight into what constitutes adaptability is in Erbil office buildings and the factors that give rise to different level of adaptability. For analyses of case studies using meta-model methodology of Robert S. and Simon A (2016). It showed that the average percentage of adaptability is half of total characteristics of building and the need for types of change are increasing in both public and private office building.

Adding the code behind the price is one way to make it easier for the on-lineshop admin when registering customers. The problem in this thesis, the authors found a fact about the field about one on-lineshop that requires customers to add a code behind the price when the customer makes payments via bank transfer. This thesis discusses how Yusuf Al-Qaradhawi's perspective on pricing contains fraud and elements of wrongdoing, as well as the proposition used by Yusuf Al-Qaradhawi and how the views of on-lineshop owners and customers in on-lineshop @FAMAS.STUFF related to adding code behind price. The research method used is qualitative research, which is meant by qualitative research is a research method that is based on the philosophy of postpositivism, which is used to examine the conditions of natural objects which later the results of qualitative research emphasize the meaning rather than generalization. In this study the authors also use research steps that can make research more systematic, accurate and have a good analysis of this study. Yusuf Al-Qaradhawi who forbids the sale and purchase which contains elements of fraud and elements of legal wrongdoing is haram. The reason given by Yusuf Al-Qaradhawi about the prohibition of buying and selling that contains these elements is so that no party is harmed because Islam justifies everything that is good.

(Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) The red flour weevil, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst 1797) is a pervasive pest, polyphagous which is becoming increasingly resistant to the normal insecticides. Finding alternative insecticides to those because of their inefficiency pollute the environment and poison consumers is an emergency. An ethno-botanical survey conducted with about 300 farmers in the Far North region of Cameroon identified 15 local plants insecticides associated with food during storage in combination with two or three others. Among these plants, the most used are Hyptis spicigera (Lamiaceae) 78%, Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) 76.6% and Vepris heterophylla (Rutaceae) 28,33% which is more used in mountain area. The powders of these single plants are insecticides on T. castaneum, however A. indica single or in combination with H. spicigera gives better insecticidal efficacy 73.33% and 66.67% mortality respectively.Keywords: Tribolium castaneum, stocked food stuff, combination, vegetal powder, insecticide Tribolium castaneum; stocked food stuff; combination; vegetal powder; insecticide International Journal of Biological and Chemical Sciences; Vol 13, No 3 (2019); 1613-1620 ; 1997-342X ; 1991-8631 Ayiki, Ev\\u00e9l\\u00e9 Nathanael; Tamgno, B\\u00e9ranger Raoul; Madou, Chantal; Vatsou, J\\u00e9r\\u00e9mie; Ngassoum, Martin Benoit; Ngamo Tinkeu, L\\u00e9onard Simon\"},{\"id\":\"9fb1c6872b573975c1525fc0305bd7df27aaddd00a79fcf8e4ed77ad3b952f83\",\"content\":\"Paparan selektif penggunaan fitur senyap dan teman dekat pada twitter dan instagram Social media has become a part of human\\u2019s life. Social Networking Sites or SNS which a part of social media allows the users to create their own network. Not only that but users can also choose their friends, what kind of content they want to see, what kind of relationship then want to have, or to keep certain content just for a few people to see through social media. A few features like mute feature to close friends feature are there for users to use on Twitter and Instagram. This research will try to find out how those features are being used by the users and why those features are needed. In depth interview is used to six informants who use the mute and close friend feature on Twitter or Instagram. Selective exposure theory is used to see how someone is more interested in seeing contents that match their believes and interests. It shows that mute feature is used to filter some stuff that they want to see and avoid things they don\\u2019t like. The mute feature also useful for keeping the relationship in a good term between the users and other people. Meanwhile, close friends feature is used to maintain the connection users have with a few people where they can share stuff to those people only. Users also think that close friends feature is useful to protect their privacy. : teori paparan selektif; jejaring sosial; media sosial; fitur senyap; teman dekat; Communication.

Regardless of the fact that it has ancientnature and serious stacking of experience in the medical education field, it isstill a very dynamic process and incorporates unique difficulties in itspresence. Like the other professional training, it is essential for the studentto learn by observing and experiencing from the tutor directly. In thiscontext, the balance between the numbers of tutor and the student is essential.In recent years, the number of medical faculties and the number of studentsincreased dramatically all over the country, and the balance is disruptedsignificantly. In the light of this knowledge, we conducted a year basedextensive analysis by using student and academic stuff records held by Rector&#039;sand Deans&#039; offices to determine optimal student number of Sivas CumhuriyetUniversity. As a result, we managed to show that the numbers of medicalstudents in Sivas Cumhuriyet University are over its capacity regardingacademic stuff and infrastructure possibilities to give a proper education. ; T\\u0131p e\\u011fitimi d\\u00fcnyadaki en eski ve en zore\\u011fitimlerden birisidir.

The employment of such labels will shape how the young person is perceived by the adults surrounding them. This will not only have an impact on the relationships that are developed between the pupil and the educator but also how the young people see themselves in terms of their own identity. This paper seeks to give voice and explore the position of young people within the confines of their educational experiences. The paper draws on 13 in-depth case studies to reflect on how young people experience the SEBD labels attached to them by others and what pupils consider to be the main antecedents leading them to display behaviour which is deemed unacceptable in the classroom. The paper highlights the importance of providing opportunities for young people to have their voice heard to fill the gap between professional perceptions and those of the pupil. In order to truly understand why young people display behaviour that is considered difficult and how they experience the labels we attach to them we have to speak to young people themselves.

Modern world leaders are already actively preparing for a new era \\u2013 the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is based on the concept of fully networked and adaptive production with intelligent systems. However, in order to use the full potential of it, changes in the labor market are needed in accordance with changing requirements and, since it is people who are the key success factors. Purpose. The purpose of the article is to study the impact of Fourth Industrial Revolution in the global industry on the staff of the enterprise. Results. The universal nature of the new industrial model proposed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, opens up the opportunity for a new industrial revolution, as a result of which the Fourth Industrial Revolution will become a new global industrial milestone and a standard for the development of the real sector of the economy all over the world. The future is for superprofessional skills and abilities. These skills are universal and important for specialists in various industries. Mastering them allows the employee to increase the efficiency of professional activity in industry, and also makes it possible to move between sectors, while maintaining his relevance. The FIR will affect absolutely all industries, but our research is devoted to new professions in the industry. Accordingly, through the prism of industry, we will consider changes in the professions. The most significant changes are expected in robotics and engineering. The following occupations are expected: Industrial robotics designer, Designer ergonomist, Operator of multifunctional robotic systems, Engineer composer, Home robots\\u2019 designer, Medical robots\\u2019 designer, Child robot\\u2019s designer and Robots neurointerface designer. At the intersection of management and production may cause such professions: Production coordinator in distributed communities, Trendvotcher \\/ Forsyter, Cross-cultural communication manager, Moderator user communities, Online sales manager. Conclusion. The Fourth industrial revolution will substantially change all spheres of life, including professional ones. As the study showed, the future of interdisciplinary professions. Employees get many benefits and comfort with a new way of working, but learning will be needed during a professional life, so the company needs strong partners. For a successful path to FIR, there are a variety of opportunities for lifelong learning and organization of work that contributes to learning. Both professional and academic training require a continuous dialogue between industry, politics and society to constantly evolve and adapt.

Insights contribute to the immediate need to advance knowledge and practice around prevention with this group. An arts-based approach, which included a two-day interactive drama workshop coupled with follow-up, peer-led focus groups, was used to explore perceptions and understandings related to intimate relationships with 15 tertiary educated young people (nine female and six male) from across Samoa. Intersectionality informed the data collection and thematic analysis, examining participants\\u2019 lived experiences and the ways multiple and intersecting identities interact within social and cultural systems to influence and inform these experiences. Outcomes highlight important tensions for young people, including the way in which age, gender, religion and sexuality interact with social hierarchies and power structures, socially prescribed gender norms, family structures and globalisation. This research provides insights that can inform the development of prevention strategies to address the root causes of intimate partner violence, building the knowledge and skills required for establishing intimate relationships free from violence with young people.

Secondly, to assess the quality of aSCR evidence for the Somatic Marker Hypothesis (SMH) during the IGT. Finally, to evaluate the reliability of current psychophysiological measurements on the IGT. Electronic databases, journals and reference lists were examined for inclusion. Data were extracted by two reviewers and validated by another reviewer, using a standardised extraction sheet along with a quality assessment. Two meta-analyses of aSCR measures were conducted to test the relationship between overall aSCR and IGT performance, and differences in aSCR between advantageous and disadvantageous decks. Twenty studies were included in this review. Quality assessment revealed that five studies did not measure anticipatory responses, and few stated they followed standard IGT and\\/or psychophysiological procedures. The first meta-analysis of 15 studies revealed a significant, small-to-medium relationship between aSCR and IGT performance (r= .22). The second meta-analysis of eight studies revealed a significant, small difference in aSCR between the advantageous and disadvantageous decks (r= .10); however, publication bias is likely to be an issue. Meta-analyses revealed aSCR evidence supporting the SMH. However, inconsistencies in the IGT and psychophysiological methods, along with publication bias, cast doubt on these effects. It is recommended that future tests of the SMH use a range of psychophysiological measures, a standardised IGT protocol, and discriminate between advantageous and disadvantageous decks. ; N\\/A Decision-making; Emotion; Reward  Simonovic, Boban; Stupple, Edward J.

Using classic Delphi technique and pairwise comparison, the components were given to 32 specialists in emergency medicine, nuclear medicine, medical physics, nuclear physics, radiobiology and radiation protection, health in disaster and emergency, and passive defense. Finally, the national model was developed by holding two focus group sessions.Results: The results from the two rounds of Delphi technique showed that 31 factors of preparedness were classified into three main classes, namely staff, stuff, and structure (system). Only three factors were excluded and the rest were agreed upon by the specialists. Given the weight of each class, it was found that staff preparedness and stuff preparedness had the highest and lowest priorities, respectively.Conclusion: Comprehensive preparedness requires enhancing and promoting cultural, social, economic, and political levels. Indeed, all preparedness levels should be promoted in alignment with each other. Hence, governments should align their policies to manage such incidents.

However, a national disaster plan has not yet been established. Aim: From September 2017, representatives of seven regional emergency medical centers in Seoul met monthly and decided to investigate basic data for the future establishment of surge capacity planning. Methods: Staff, supply, space, and systems for surge capacity were surveyed in seven hospitals. The additional surveyed data were as follows: hospital incident command system and actual operational experience; performance of disaster drill; safety and security plan; estimation of surge capacity in normal operating conditions and extreme operating conditions; alternative therapeutic spaces; back-up plan to call non-duty medical staff; decontamination equipment; contingency plan for stuff shortage; etc. Results: All the hospitals reported they have hospital incident command systems and held disaster drills every year, however, the two hospitals (28.5%) had no real experience of hospital incident command system activation. Five hospitals (71.4%) did not have a safety and security plan. They replied they can treat average 7.7 emergency patients (Korean Triage and Acute scale (KTAS) \\u2264 3), 10 non-emergent patients (KTAS&gt;4), 0.9 surgical patients and 0.7 unstable patients simultaneously in normal operating conditions. In extreme operating conditions, they replied they can treat average 26.4 emergency patients (KTAS \\u2264 3), 54.3 non-emergent patients (KTAS&gt;4), 37 surgical patients and 2.3 unstable patients simultaneously. The two hospitals (28.5%) had no alternative therapeutic spaces, no back-up plan to call non-duty medical staff and no contingency plan for stuff shortage. Three hospitals (42.9%) did not have decontamination equipment. Discussion: The survey revealed the basic data for surge capacity planning in Seoul. Data from hospitals other than regional emergency medical centers should be collected for the completion of disaster plans.

Some of the earlier children's folklorists were novelists primarily, some schoolteachers, though the more recent tendency has been for them to be professors, and Factor's book is heavily drenched in footnotes from multiple sources.

The challenge that a new sociology of testing must address is that ubiquitous testing changes the relations between science, engineering and sociology: Engineering is today in the very stuff of where society happens.

The anxiety caused by accumulation and disorder are directly related to the progressive entry of goods into homes. Now, what happens in the case of some elderly homeowners whose lifestyles have changed little over the past decades and have a much different relationship to current consumer culture and domestic accumulation? Based on an auto-ethnographic approach, this visual essay looks at the home the author\\u2019s grandparents have built throughout their life. It argues that, although the house is full of objects that have been accumulating over the decades, these objects can hardly be catalogued as stuff. Material and symbolic stability are favoured by the reduced traffic of objects entering and leaving the house and the importance of care and maintenance practices but, overall, by the ability of the house to provide a specific and differentiated place for each object.

Unfortunately, hospitals are not prepared: even where a plan for massive influx of patients is present, it usually focuses on sudden onset disaster trauma victims (the most probable case scenario), and it has not been tested, validated, or propagated to the staff.

We recognize materials from shape, color and texture features. This paper is a selective review and discussion of how artists have been using shape features to evoke vivid impressions of specific materials and material properties. A number of examples are presented in which visual artists render materials or their transformations, such as soft human skin, runny or viscous fluids, or wrinkled cloth. They achieve this by expressing the telltale shape features of these materials and transformations, often by carving them from a single block of marble or wood. Vision research has just begun to investigate these very shape features, making material perception a prime example of how art can inform science.

To understand the neural mechanisms yielding such complex impressions, we suggest that it is necessary to extend existing experimental approaches to those that view material perception as a distributed and dynamic process. A distributed representations framework not only fits better with our perceptual experience of material qualities, it is commensurate with recent psychophysics and neuroimaging results.

Although he was critical of orthodox psychoanalysis, Bowlby appears to have been seriously involved in Freudian dream interpretation in the 1930s and 1940s. Here, we present in annotated form his own interpretations of several of his dreams from that time and a series of lectures on dreams. In Attachment and Loss, classic dream interpretation is absent and Bowlby used the content of dreams as a reflection of the influence of real-life experiences on the representations of attachment relations, with a clear focus on grief, loss, and mourning.

However, it is unclear from the literature what exactly information sharing is and why it is important to institutional performance. This paper seeks to deconstruct the concept of information sharing, particularly within aspects of the supply chain. We shall argue that the central problem with the concept of information sharing is that it relies on a notion of information as stuff that can be manipulated, transmitted, and used in an unproblematic manner between organizations. We wish to question conventional notions of this construct by examining and analyzing a case of information sharing, applicable within an international supply chain, as well as several problems experienced with such sharing. Through deconstructing this case we demonstrate how certain perceived problems in information sharing are better conceptualized as breakdowns in the interinstitutional scaffolding of data structures.

Our findings challenge positive post-Ebola narratives about international aid and military deployment. A morally appropriate people's science emerged under the radar of external scrutiny, including that of a paramount chief.

We wish to pursue in this study that, beyond technological considerations, it is necessary to expand the scope of child protection by establishing mutual collaboration between regulators, distributors and video on demand services, as well as consumers and parents\\u2019 organisations, in an effort to further enhance cooperation and mutual understanding (European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, 2017b, p. 75). It is for this reason that we believe that the academic sphere can also be invited into this wide-ranging discussion on child protection to contribute reflections on a key aspect: audiovisual and media education, an essential pillar of protection in addition to filters, external limits, and electronic labelling. We thus uphold a vision that not only considers the \\u201cdigital stuff\\u201d but also highlights the need for \\u201cethos stuff\\u201d (Goggin, 2008, p.89). In this respect, we have considered it essential a literature review on the concept of media literacy. Secondly, our qualitative methodology involves an analysis of the instructions issued by the European Union and their implementation in Spain. In this stage, we have conducted desk research based on a narrative analysis of the documents and programs of different institutions in order to chart the evolution of the question in recent years, at a time when the digital environment has changed more quickly than ever before. This same type of analysis is also conducted on the initiatives of European and Spanish companies to determine whether they are implementing child protection strategies.

In two undergraduate samples (N = 248, 183), the current study assessed the extent to which various forms of insecurity (i.e., low self-esteem, public self-consciousness, relative deprivation, anxious attachment, fear of death) mediate the relationship between the Buddhist construct of nonattachment and materialism. In line with expectations, greater nonattachment was directly associated with reduced materialism in both samples. Nonattachment was also found to be indirectly associated with reduced materialism via reduced public self-consciousness and relative deprivation. Self-esteem, anxious attachment, and fear of death did not mediate the relationship between nonattachment and materialism. The findings therefore indicate that the acceptance and non-contingent sense of self typical of nonattachment may play an important role in minimising the experience or impact of insecurity that can contribute to materialism, as well as minimising the importance placed on material goals.

Constructed as an assemblage of curated texts discarded and washed up on shore, the novel follows characters who wonder whether their own identities and communities are collages of flotsam whose worth is dependent on arbitrary judgments and accidental encounters. This essay examines how Ozeki excavates literary landfills to recuperate trashed narratives and devalued people, proposing that the very stuff cultures reject as worthless provides compost for the growth of new meaning. The essay further explores how Ozeki deploys the Schr\\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment to critique the process of assigning worth and posit the concept of entanglement as a foundation for construction of community.

Books and erotic photographs, contraceptives, sex toys and remedies for increasing sexual potency: the diversity of these products relating to sexual practices is clearly revealed by the case. The dossier demonstrates how this commercial enterprise drew on the benefits of industrialization, mass media and globalization for building its client-base and developing a transnational dimension. It also allows us to understand the strategies deployed to keep the sale of these objects clandestine, in a context where they were increasingly overseen by the authorities, revealing innovative forms of commercial exchange, based on an epistolary transvestism.

Abstract The protagonists of Michel Gondry\\u2019s Be Kind Rewind recycle twice over, using junkyard stuff like tires and plastic bags to remake famous films in a series of no-budget shorts. This essay turns to Be Kind Rewind to ask how the recycling of materials may relate to the recycling of intellectual properties.

As such, the essay offers several different approaches to thinking about media adaptation in the age of global warming, drawing variously from sociologists, political ecologists, film theorists, and designers.

This paper shifts the focus from the stuff that is being positioned as money to the social totality. Credit theorists claim that commodity theories of money imply monetary neutrality and a primacy of real analysis. In contrast, this paper argues based on Marx and Smith that, independently of whether money is a commodity or credit, the necessity of money depends on the constitution of the economy in terms of the relation between production and circulation. If social production is constituted through the exchange between private specialised producers, money is not neutral but essential. For Smith, real analysis is nevertheless meaningful, in that, he treats the spheres of exchange and production separately. By contrast, Marx exposes real analysis as commodity fetishism and stresses the mutually constitutive social relations between money, commodity exchange and capitalist production.

Around the world, dye wastewater has turned out to be one of the fundamental reasons for several environmental pollution problems because of the increased noteworthy demand for textile products and the relative increment in production and application of engineered dyes. As a consequence, in the furtherance of waste water treatment, it has become both a major concern and imperative to treat the industrial effluent that originates from textile and dye stuff plants accounting for a continuous discharge of remnant dyes to the environment. For the same, the efficient treatment of this textile effluent in an eco- friendly manner has gained a lot of attention in contemporary days, reasoning from which is where the concept of Bioremediation intervenes and which was the core aspect of our project. In the present study, our focus in it?s totality has been on operating three different bacterial species namely Bacillus, Pseudomonas & Staphylococcus Aureus in pursuit of treating the industrial effluent incorporating synthetic dyes.
