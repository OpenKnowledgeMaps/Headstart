Although training for top-down attentional control has been an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder, few studies have demonstrated that individuals with social anxiety have top-down attentional dysfunction. This study used dichotic listening (DL) tasks to investigate the relationship between social anxiety and top-down attentional control over relevant brain activities. We also investigated relationships between both social situation-dependent self-focused attention and external attention bias and situation-independent attentional control. Thirty-six healthy participants underwent near-infrared spectroscopy scanning while performing top-down selective and divided attention DL tasks. Then, they undertook a speech task and completed a questionnaire to assess the degrees of their self-focused attention and external attention bias. The results showed that the degree of social fear and self-focused attention during the speech task were negatively correlated with scores on the selective attention task and with the activity of the left pars opercularis during the selective DL task, which were related to each other. These results suggest that a relationship exists between social fear, self-focused attention in a social situation, and top-down selective attentional dysfunction as assessed both behaviorally and by brain activity changes.\",\"published_in\":\"Perceptual and Motor Skills ; volume 126, issue 6, page 1101-1116 ; ISSN 0031-5125 1558-688X\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology; Sensory Systems\",\"subject\":\"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology; Sensory Systems\",\"authors\":\"Tomita, Nozomi; Imai, Shoji; Kanayama, Yusuke; Kumano, Hiroaki\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0031512519867798\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"b8fec5a7f2e385148416f3604822c88f125d14148b7d3a321e59de580a8c20e0\",\"relevance\":120},{\"id\":\"c4c65543eff6754d669e4933813d539561d3be53d1b5b04e244a9d83157fd0ac\",\"relation\":\"PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE; http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/30849; http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/30850; doi:10.1017\\/S003329171900031X\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/30849; http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/30850; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1017\\/S003329171900031X\",\"title\":\"Heritability of reflexive social attention triggered by eye gaze and walking direction: common and unique genetic underpinnings\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background Social attention ability is crucial for human adaptive social behaviors and interpersonal communications, and the malfunction of which has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a highly genetic neurodevelopmental disorder marked by striking social deficits.

Adolescents' attention-seeking motives were examined as a mediator of these over-time associations. In line with this model's account of self-image failure, we also expected that narcissistic youth's attention-seeking should increase following experiences of ego threat, such as social rejection.

In line with predictions, earlier adolescent narcissism predicted later social media disclosure, problematic use, and smartphone stress, via increased attention-seeking. Furthermore, a significant interaction between narcissism and perceived social rejection at T1 predicted adolescents' outcomes at T2, via attention-seeking; Participants with a combination of higher narcissism and higher rejection at T1 reported higher levels of attention-seeking at T2.

Multisensory and dynamic events have been shown to elicit more attention and produce greater sustained attention in infants than auditory or visual events alone. Such redundant and often temporally synchronous information guides selectivity and facilitates perception, learning, and memory of properties of events specified by redundancy. In addition, events involving faces or other social stimuli provide an extraordinary amount of redundant information that attracts and sustains attention. In the current study, 4- and 8-month-old infants were shown 2-min multimodal videos featuring social or nonsocial stimuli to determine the relative roles of synchrony and stimulus category in inducing attention. Behavioral measures included average looking time and peak look duration, and convergent measurement of heart rate (HR) allowed for the calculation of HR-defined phases of attention: Orienting (OR), sustained attention (SA), and attention termination (AT). The synchronous condition produced an earlier onset of SA (less time in OR) and a deeper state of SA than the asynchronous condition. Social stimuli attracted and held attention (longer duration of peak looks and lower HR than nonsocial stimuli). Effects of synchrony and the social nature of stimuli were additive, suggesting independence of their influence on attention. These findings are the first to demonstrate different HR-defined phases of attention as a function of intersensory redundancy, suggesting greater salience and deeper processing of naturalistic synchronous audiovisual events compared with asynchronous ones.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-03-27T18:48:43Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Infant attention; Intersensory perception; Intersensory redundancy; Temporal synchrony; Social and nonsocial stimuli; Heart rate\",\"subject\":\"Infant attention; Intersensory perception; Intersensory redundancy; Temporal synchrony; Social and nonsocial stimuli; Heart rate\",\"authors\":\"Curtindal, Lori M.; Bahrick, Lorraine E.; Lickliter, Robert; Colombo, John\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1808\\/30195\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c29c0d995d74db71b89f9f8d2b900db5dd1a19af67d2909985ca76fb420ea6a8\",\"relevance\":114},{\"id\":\"295f407b52ded3a3c6b8b6d02e0627d4c060fd4c49ec17e16bd0f3fff11ca124\",\"relation\":\"Yu, Chen, Suanda, Sumarga H and Smith, Linda B (2018) Infant sustained attention but not joint attention to objects at 9 months predicts vocabulary at 12 and 15 months.

These networks can be modulated by different contextual and relational situations. Aim of this review is to explain how a combination of natural and social stimuli can positively affect the attentional processes. It has been proposed that the exposition to natural environment can positively affect direct attention, a common resource supporting both executive functioning and self-regulation processes in cognition. It has been suggested that the decrease of the effort required to voluntary control attention from the bottom upwards could determine some internal reflection that may support creative thinking secondarily to a simultaneous reduction in the effort required to orient attention between thoughts and impressions. In my view, not only exposition to natural and green environment improves attentional processes but also the involvement in social relationship. The development of the orientation and inhibitory control networks is sensitive to the social nature of the stimuli, for instance, in a task, including socially relevant stimuli the efficiency of these two attentional networks increases in children, in adults and in elderly subjects. Social attention, starting very early in the life (joint attention) is a very important mechanism for the regulation of social relationships. A key for a better development of cognitive functions such as attentional processes is the promotion of the immersion in the natural environment and the involvement in social relationship.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships\",\"subject\":\"natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships\",\"authors\":\"Federico, Francesca\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11573\\/1422537\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"cb02adabbbcfb41c21e7b98e6afe78d7ac6ddb444be9dcbb07439bc15c050dce\",\"relevance\":110},{\"id\":\"32f558e65b0a59b654000bc7b2c0488148159fe17c7f9e4edb65ec52130262ec\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.1016\\/j.cognition.2019.03.019\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/21.11116\\/0000-0004-3B12-6\",\"title\":\"A new look at joint attention and common knowledge\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Everyone agrees that joint attention is a key feature of human social cognition. Yet, despite over 40 years of work and hundreds of publications on this topic, there is still surprisingly little agreement on what exactly joint attention is, and how the jointness in it is achieved. Part of the problem, we propose, is that joint attention is not a single process, but rather it includes a cluster of different cognitive skills and processes, and different researchers focus on different aspects of it. A similar problem applies to common knowledge. Here we present a new approach: We outline a typology of social attention levels which are currently all referred to in the literature as joint attention (from monitoring to common, mutual, and shared attention), along with corresponding levels of common knowledge. We consider cognitive, behavioral, and phenomenological aspects of the different levels as well as their different functions, and a key distinction we make in all of this is second-personal vs. third-personal relations.

However, few empirical studies have examined social attention biases in animal groups. Sex-based and kinship-based biases in social learning and social attention towards females have been shown in a despotic and female philopatric primate: the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The present study examined social attention during the juvenile period. Social attention was recorded through 5-min focal observations during periods of natural foraging. Kin emerged as the most important focus of social attention in juveniles, intensified by biased spatial proximity towards matrilineal related members. The highest-ranking conspecifics were more frequently observed by juveniles than low-ranking ones. Additionally, younger and orphaned juveniles showed higher levels of social attention overall, compared to other age categories. No effect of the juvenile's hierarchical rank was detected, suggesting that the variation in social attention recorded reflects different biases and stages of social learning and socialisation, rather than social anxiety. Juvenile females tended to exhibit a dominance-based bias more strongly than did males. This might be explained by a greater emphasis on attaining social knowledge during juvenile socialisation in the philopatric sex. Moreover, despite a preferred association between juveniles, social attention was more often directed to adults, suggesting that adults may still be more often chosen as a target of attention independent of their dominance rank.\",\"published_in\":\"Primates; journal of primatology, vol. 60, no. 3, pp. 261-275\",\"year\":\"2019-05\",\"subject_orig\":\"Age Factors; Animals; Wild\\/psychology; Attention; Behavior; Animal; Cercopithecus aethiops\\/psychology; Female; Grooming; Male; Social Behavior; Social Dominance; Social Learning; Socialization; Early social experience; Female philopatry; Juvenile socialisation; Rank acquisition; Social learning biases; Social network\",\"subject\":\"Age Factors; Animals; Wild\\/psychology; Attention; Behavior; Animal; Cercopithecus aethiops\\/psychology; Female; Grooming; Male; Social Behavior; Social Dominance; Social Learning; Socialization; Early social experience; Female philopatry; Juvenile socialisation; Rank acquisition; Social learning biases; Social network\",\"authors\":\"Grampp, M.; Sueur, C.; van de Waal, E.; Botting, J.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/notice\\/serval:BIB_ED250B9AEB6A\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"80c4f1da4260c990df6503db68c023a337c46839b6ce448009fc64d4fe382ea7\",\"relevance\":106},{\"id\":\"eca26e105d51e98184e671396503cf278d39762c24453baea690932127f5f18c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fnhum.2020.00201\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1662-5161; 1662-5161; doi:10.3389\\/fnhum.2020.00201; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e2867caedcef4b6cbf7bc06280d9cd0c\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fnhum.2020.00201; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e2867caedcef4b6cbf7bc06280d9cd0c\",\"title\":\"Joint Attention During Live Person-to-Person Contact Activates rTPJ, Including a Sub-Component Associated With Spontaneous Eye-to-Eye Contact\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Eye-to-eye contact is a spontaneous behavior between interacting partners that occurs naturally during social interactions. However, individuals differ with respect to eye gaze behaviors such as frequency of eye-to-eye contacts, and these variations may reflect underlying differences in social behavior in the population. While the use of eye signaling to indicate a shared object of attention in joint attention tasks has been well-studied, the effects of the natural variation in establishing eye contact during joint attention have not been isolated. Here, we investigate this question using a novel two-person joint attention task. Participants were not instructed regarding the use of eye contacts; thus all mutual eye contact events between interacting partners that occurred during the joint attention task were spontaneous and varied with respect to frequency. We predicted that joint attention systems would be modulated by differences in the social behavior across participant pairs, which could be measured by the frequency of eye contact behavior. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and eye-tracking to measure the neural signals associated with joint attention in interacting dyads and to record the number of eye contact events between them. Participants engaged in a social joint attention task in which real partners used eye gaze to direct each other\\u2019s attention to specific targets. Findings were compared to a non-social joint attention task in which an LED cue directed both partners\\u2019 attention to the same target. The social joint attention condition showed greater activity in right temporoparietal junction than the non-social condition, replicating prior joint attention results. Eye-contact frequency modulated the joint attention activity, revealing bilateral activity in social and high level visual areas associated with partners who made more eye contact. Additionally, when the number of mutual eye contact events was used to classify each pair as either \\u201chigh eye contact\\u201d or \\u201clow eye contact\\u201d dyads, cross-brain coherence analysis revealed greater coherence between high eye contact dyads than low eye contact dyads in these same areas. Together, findings suggest that variation in social behavior as measured by eye contact modulates activity in a subunit of the network associated with joint attention.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Vol 14 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"joint attention; eye-to-eye contact; two-person neuroscience; live dyadic interactions; fNIRS; hyperscanning; Neurosciences.

Disruption in this early neurobehavioral process may decrease the frequency and quality of social interactions and learning opportunities, potentially leading to downstream deleterious effects on social development. This study examined early attention in infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are at risk for social and communication delays. Visual and auditory attention was mapped from age 1 week to 5 months in infants at familial risk for ASD (high risk; N = 41) and low-risk typically developing infants (low risk; N = 39). At 12 months, a subset of participants ( N = 40) was administered assessments of social communication and nonverbal cognitive skills. Results revealed that high-risk infants performed lower on attention tasks at 2 and 3 months of age compared to low-risk infants. A significant association between overall attention at 3 months and developmental outcome at 12 months was observed for both groups. These results provide evidence for early vulnerabilities in visual attention for infants at risk for ASD during a period of important neurodevelopmental transition (between 2 and 3 months) when attention has significant implications for social communication and cognitive development.\",\"published_in\":\"Development and Psychopathology ; volume 32, issue 2, page 491-501 ; ISSN 0954-5794 1469-2198\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Developmental and Educational Psychology; Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"subject\":\"Developmental and Educational Psychology; Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"authors\":\"Bradshaw, Jessica; Klin, Ami; Evans, Lindsey; Klaiman, Cheryl; Saulnier, Celine; McCracken, Courtney\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0954579419000233\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"c52e8ad1ac9eaaffac24e31b2b7114a6783441ddd8196cb08430bc2670e9ca99\",\"relevance\":104},{\"id\":\"fa7750663aa2730b82afd51b0b6acef5a3e98b8c4dc492076ec4d477575168d9\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/marketing.expertjournals.com\\/23446773-801\\/; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2344-6773; 2344-6773; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/44d0baccbfcf444d980cc13d5963a649\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/44d0baccbfcf444d980cc13d5963a649\",\"title\":\"Relationships between Social Media Promotion, Attention, Interest, Search, Action, and Share of Tourists in Kei Island\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Indonesia's tourism ministry is currently intensively using the online environment to promote many of Indonesia\\u2019s favorite tourism destinations.

Vigilance was operationalized as the time it took to relocate the gaze from a central position to a peripherally appearing social stimulus. The latency to disengage from a centrally located social stimulus, when a non-social stimulus appeared in the periphery, was used as a proxy for avoidance. Attention characteristics in the SAD group were compared to non-anxious (NA) controls (N = 22). Visual attention was measured using eye tracking. Participants in both the SAD and NA groups were vigilant towards angry faces, compared to neutral and happy faces. Similarly, both groups disengaged attention faster from angry faces. Adolescents with SAD who disengaged faster from social stimuli had less social anxiety after CBT. The results indicate that anxious youth display a vigilant-avoidant attention pattern to threat.

Vigilance was operationalized as the time it took to relocate the gaze from a central position to a peripherally appearing social stimulus. The latency to disengage from a centrally located social stimulus, when a non-social stimulus appeared in the periphery, was used as a proxy for avoidance. Attention characteristics in the SAD group were compared to non-anxious (NA) controls (N = 22). Visual attention was measured using eye tracking. Participants in both the SAD and NA groups were vigilant towards angry faces, compared to neutral and happy faces. Similarly, both groups disengaged attention faster from angry faces. Adolescents with SAD who disengaged faster from social stimuli had less social anxiety after CBT. The results indicate that anxious youth display a vigilant-avoidant attention pattern to threat. However, partly inconsistent with previous research, the same pattern was observed in the NA group.\",\"published_in\":\"PLoS ONE, Vol 14, Iss 11, p e0225603 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"subject\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"authors\":\"Jens H\\u00f6gstr\\u00f6m; Martina Nordh; Miriam Larson Lindal; Ebba Taylor; Eva Serlachius; Johan Lundin Kleberg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/journal.pone.0225603\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"7ca009074ce9a17dfb2aee05687b441088e1ef836da05e006cd9900faabe939a\",\"relevance\":99},{\"id\":\"ba22c43d6f67c3e231214fb6e8676d37df300f1e9598fdca78366bcb8c697486\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/psyjournals.ru\\/en\\/psyedu_ej\\/2020\\/n1\\/Smirnova.shtml; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2587-6139; doi:10.17759\\/psyedu.2020120108; 2587-6139; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c3e447ff12f1498ab16e5d4974d69008\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17759\\/psyedu.2020120108; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c3e447ff12f1498ab16e5d4974d69008\",\"title\":\"Joint Attention and Sensitivity to Orienting Gaze in Children with Atypical Development\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The article is devoted to the study of the relationship between the mechanism of joint attention and the subsequent normative and atypical development of the child. It is shown that the ability to establish joint attention based on the direction of the interlocutor's gaze is a precursor of the emergence of social and cognitive abilities. The study examined the differences between typical developmental children and atypical development control groups in their ability to be sensitive to social behavioral signals, namely the orientation direction of the interlocutor's gaze. On a sample of 120 children with typical development, mental retardation, hearing impairment, speech disorders and visual impairment, a number of tasks were developed to assess the ability to use the character's direction of sight in the picture to determine its intentions. The task measured such a skill of joint attention as the child\\u2019s ability to calculate and report what the other person was looking at and what he intended to choose. We also used tasks with a central hint with an explicit indication of an arrow and a peripheral hint to check the recognition of social and non-social orienting signals. Based on the comparison of contrasting groups, the variability of the formation and age-related changes in skills of joint attention, or rather the presence of differences in recognition, synthesis and interpretation orienting social information coming from eye contact. It was found that children with atpic development have a low level of \\\"downward\\\" joint attention. Impaired joint attention may be one of the earliest signs in children with atypical development at a later age. The results showed that deficiencies in the behavior of joint attention vary depending on mental age and level of development, a sensory defect, so the level of development can really affect the ability of children to joint attention.\",\"published_in\":\"Psihologo-Pedagogi\\u010deskie Issledovani\\u00e2, Vol 12, Iss 1, Pp 105-121 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"attention; joint attention; social cognition; age-related development; preschool age; theory of mind; mental model; mental retardation; autism; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"attention; joint attention; social cognition; age-related development; preschool age; theory of mind; mental model; mental retardation; autism; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"Smirnova Ya.K.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17759\\/psyedu.2020120108\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ba22c43d6f67c3e231214fb6e8676d37df300f1e9598fdca78366bcb8c697486\",\"relevance\":98},{\"id\":\"b7cc8b3fae51b3c8fee68ad809b31f6112abffb4c412a4b69901010612588769\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/irep.ntu.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/39876\\/1\\/1326789_Paukner.pdf; http:\\/\\/irep.ntu.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/39876\\/2\\/1326789_Paukner_Supp.pdf; http:\\/\\/irep.ntu.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/39876\\/3\\/1326789_Paukner_Supp_Movie.avi; MAYLOTT, S.E., PAUKNER, A., AHN, Y.A. and SIMPSON, E.A., 2020.

Attention is one of the most important cognitive functions which is impaired in children with ADHD that can affect the future educational, social and occupational functions of these children. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of attention training on attentional functions in children with ADHD. Materials and Methods The method of this study was semi- experimental with purposive sampling with pre-test and post-test for control group. For this aim, 40 male students were diagnosed as ADHD who were selected by clinical interview and Conner's questionnaire and randomly 20 participants were assigned in the experimental group and 20 were assigned in the control group. In order to measure the variables of the research, Stroop task, continuous performance test, Wisconsin Card Sorting test, and divided attention test were used. Attention training was presented on the experimental group in 8 sessions, using a set of related cognitive games and attention-based task .For data analysis, covariance analysis was used. Results The results indicated that attention training significantly increased the sustained attention performance and response inhibition of children with ADHD, but there was no significant effect on the selective attention function, shifting attention and divided attention.

There are two contrasting reasons why this might be: first, social context may influence increases in infants\\u2019 endogenous (voluntary) attention control; second, social settings may offer increased opportunities for exogenous attentional capture. To differentiate these possibilities, we compared 12-month-old infants\\u2019 naturalistic attention patterns in two settings: Solo Play and Joint Play with a social partner (the parent). Consistent with previous research we found that infants\\u2019 look durations toward play objects were longer during Joint Play, and that moments of inattentiveness were fewer, and shorter. Follow-up analyses, conducted to differentiate the two above-proposed hypotheses, were more consistent with the latter hypothesis. We found that infants\\u2019 rate of change of attentiveness was faster during Joint Play than Solo Play, suggesting that internal attention factors, such as attentional inertia, may influence looking behaviour less during Joint Play. We also found that adults\\u2019 attention forwards-predicted infants\\u2019 subsequent attention more than vice versa, suggesting that adults\\u2019 behaviour may drive infants\\u2019 behaviour. Finally, we found that mutual gaze did not directly facilitate infant attentiveness. Overall, our results suggest that infants spend more time attending to objects during Joint Play than Solo Play, but that these differences are more likely attributable to increased exogenous attentional scaffolding from the parent during social play, rather than to increased endogenous attention control from the infant.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"Humans; Physical Stimulation; Infant Behavior; Parents; Social Perception; Attention; Play and Playthings; Adult; Infant; Young Adult\",\"subject\":\"Humans; Physical Stimulation; Infant Behavior; Parents; Social Perception; Attention; Play and Playthings; Adult; Infant; Young Adult\",\"authors\":\"Wass, Sam V; Clackson, Kaili; Georgieva, Stanimira; Brightman, Laura; Nutbrown, Rebecca; Leong, Victoria\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.repository.cam.ac.uk\\/handle\\/1810\\/277556\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"757835635802a983446ce03b19141f2e1fa5236efb06ebe43956c9ef05a5904a\",\"relevance\":95},{\"id\":\"ec0b231d1cb089abcab672d5c7a1ebfff4c5a7661facfa169b1e37e3487d079a\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/repository.essex.ac.uk\\/20632\\/7\\/s13423-017-1354-0.pdf; Atkinson, MA and Simpson, AA and Cole, GG (2018) 'Visual attention and action: How cueing, direct mapping, and social interactions drive orienting.'

Our review proposes that, in line with the literature on eye gaze, action is a particularly strong orienting cue for the visual system.

However, few empirical studies have examined social attention biases in animal groups. Sex-based and kinship-based biases in social learning and social attention towards females have been shown in a despotic and female philopatric primate: the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The present study examined social attention during the juvenile period. Social attention was recorded through 5-min focal observations during periods of natural foraging. Kin emerged as the most important focus of social attention in juveniles, intensified by biased spatial proximity towards matrilineal related members. The highest-ranking conspecifics were more frequently observed by juveniles than low-ranking ones. Additionally, younger and orphaned juveniles showed higher levels of social attention overall, compared to other age categories. No effect of the juvenile\\u2019s hierarchical rank was detected, suggesting that the variation in social attention recorded reflects different biases and stages of social learning and socialisation, rather than social anxiety.

However, few empirical studies have examined social attention biases in animal groups. Sex-based and kinship-based biases in social learning and social attention towards females have been shown in a despotic and female philopatric primate: the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The present study examined social attention during the juvenile period. Social attention was recorded through 5-min focal observations during periods of natural foraging. Kin emerged as the most important focus of social attention in juveniles, intensified by biased spatial proximity towards matrilineal related members. The highest-ranking conspecifics were more frequently observed by juveniles than low-ranking ones. Additionally, younger and orphaned juveniles showed higher levels of social attention overall, compared to other age categories. No effect of the juvenile\\u2019s hierarchical rank was detected, suggesting that the variation in social attention recorded reflects different biases and stages of social learning and socialisation, rather than social anxiety. Juvenile females tended to exhibit a dominance-based bias more strongly than did males.

The current study included 63 college students with social anxiety. Participants were assigned to the attention modification program (AMP, n = 20), the attention control condition (ACC, n = 20) and the passive waiting group (PW, n = 23). Questionnaires and the emotional Stroop task with EEG recordings were used to assess whether and how the 4-week ABM period affected emotional symptoms and specific emotional processing. Results showed that the two training groups (AMP and ACC) produced comparable emotional improvements and both showed a decrease in negative bias compared with the PW group. The ERP results indicated that despite no significant ERP changes in the PW group, the ACC group exhibited a greater N1, whereas the AMP group exhibited a reduced VPP at the post-test stage compared to the pre-test stage. Besides, both training groups showed a similar late positive potential (LPP) reduction. Notably, the reduction in LPP was positively correlated with behavioral and symptom improvement. Thus, manipulations unique to ABM (face-target contingency) primarily modulate the early attention distribution of material-related stimuli.

Typically, this bias has been conceptualized as driven by an overactive bottom-up attentional system; however, this potentially overlooks the role of top-down attention in being able to modulate this bottom-up bias. Here, the role of top-down mechanisms in directing attention toward emotional faces was assessed with a modified dot-probe task, in which participants were given a top-down cue (\\\"happy\\\" or \\\"angry\\\") to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial, and the cued face was either presented with a face of the other emotion (angry, happy) or a neutral face. This study found that social anxiety was not associated with differences in shifting attention toward cued angry faces. However, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were selectively impaired in attentional shifting toward a cued happy face when it was paired with an angry face, but not when paired with a neutral face. The results indicate that top-down attention can be used to orient attention to emotional faces, but that higher levels of social anxiety are associated with selective deficits in top-down control of attention in the presence of threat.

This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other\\u2019s mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.\",\"published_in\":\"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review\",\"year\":\"2020-07-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophie; Wissenschaftstheorie und Religionswissenschaft; ddc:150; ddc:570\",\"subject\":\"Philosophie; Wissenschaftstheorie und Religionswissenschaft;  \",\"authors\":\"Battich, Lucas; Fairhurst, Merle T.; Deroy, Ophelia\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de\\/72900\\/1\\/Battich_Fairhurst_Deroy_2020_Coordinating_attention_requires_coordinated_sense.pdf\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"ef86ef03aaa8607832110df187effc854d231c1a7892c95ac25a1b85360cdeb4\",\"relevance\":80},{\"id\":\"24f795f2e125f59fe014d3eee0f8678deb0bf66d0e45a10d2a97564c79e1e133\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0308022620902681\",\"title\":\"The impact of person\\u2013environment\\u2013occupation transactions on joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder: A scoping review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Introduction Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrate difficulty with joint attention, affecting social and occupational performance. Studies of joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder employ a variety of instrumentation, environments and occupations. From the occupational therapy perspective, current literature lacks a rigorous analysis of the transactions of person, environment and occupation embedded within the procedures of these studies. The goal of this scoping review was to investigate how these components transact to affect occupational performance. Method Using the Person\\u2013Environment\\u2013Occupation model as an evaluative lens, a scoping review was completed to summarize person, environment and occupation transactions in studies examining joint attention in children aged 6\\u201312 years with autism spectrum disorder. Results Six studies were included. Findings indicated that simplified social environments and demonstrations of joint attention promoted higher joint attention performance in children with autism spectrum disorder, at the cost of ecological validity. Maintaining ecological validity in complex social environments resulted in lower joint attention performance. Conclusion The Person\\u2013Environment\\u2013Occupation model can be used to develop an occupational therapy perspective on literature from outside the discipline.

Loneliness is a motivational factor for building and maintaining social connections. Automatic attention occurs with little cognitive effort and plays a key role in detecting biologically salient events, such as human faces. Although previous studies have investigated the effect of loneliness on social behavior, the effect of loneliness on automatic attention to human faces remains largely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of loneliness on automatic visual attention to warmth and competence facial information, which determines facial attraction. This study included 43 participants who rated warmth and competence facial information. Then, they engaged with the target-distractor paradigm in which they saw two house images at the top and bottom and indicated whether the images were identical. During the task, we presented two faces as distractors and measured visual attention toward the faces as automatic attention because participants did not have to attend to the faces. The results showed an interactive effect between subjective loneliness and facial information on automatic attention. Warm targets automatically captured the attention of people feeling relatively lonely, whereas competent targets automatically captured the attention of those who felt less lonely. These results suggest that loneliness adaptively influences automatic processing of social information.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 10 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"automatic attention; competence; loneliness; social cognition; warmth; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"automatic attention; competence; loneliness; social cognition; warmth; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Toshiki Saito; Kosuke Motoki; Rui Nouchi; Ryuta Kawashima; Motoaki Sugiura\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2019.02967\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b6222e10a85b25b8c18a8ab3732d78ce15806948fe1cb583a62b03e096e5f0d2\",\"relevance\":77},{\"id\":\"0ec13e43b44edb66ec98c749db09f35dbf192d314ceee589c5f7deeaddf9cf2d\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/irep.ntu.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/37382\\/1\\/14531_Cristino.pdf; WILLIAMS, E.H., CRISTINO, F. and CROSS, E.S., 2019.

IMPROVING VISUAL ATTENTION TO SOCIAL STIMULI IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Social dysfunction is a hallmark characteristic of schizophrenia, and individuals with this disorder often report difficulty navigating daily social interactions. Perceptual deficits, such as faulty visual attention to important aspects of social stimuli (i.e., failing to look at the most relevant portions of a stimulus), may be one mechanism by which social deficits arise. Faulty modulation of specific neural regions such as the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), may underlie visual attention abnormalities, and may act as suitable targets for neurostimulation. The current study utilizes neurostimulation to experimentally manipulate specific neural networks and determine whether stimulation 1) improves visual attention, 2) improves performance on social cognitive tasks, and 3) whether altered visual attention moderates this improved performance. Methods Using a double-blind crossover design, participants underwent both active and sham stimulation via tDCS approximately one week apart. Half of the participants received active and sham stimulation of rTPJ (n = 22), while the other half received active and sham stimulation of a comparator site within the social brain network (dmPFC, n = 23). After stimulation, visual attention was assessed through concurrent eye-tracking while participants complete several tasks of social cognition (emotion recognition: ER40, BLERT; Theory of Mind: TASIT). Visual attention was determined as the proportion of time spent attending to socially and contextually important AOIs. Results Data collection and data processing are still ongoing for this study, however planned interim analyses on a subset of the total sample (n = 45) indicate small to medium effects of active stimulation to the rTPJ compared to sham and dmPFC stimulation for both visual attention (\\u03b7p2=.035) and social cognitive performance on the BLERT task (\\u03b7p2=.067), specifically. These same effects are not seen in the other social cognitive tasks. Final analyses based on a sample size of 72 individuals are expected to be complete prior to presentation at SIRS 2020. Discussion This study is the first, to our knowledge, to target this neural region within schizophrenia for the purposes of improving visual attention and, subsequently, social cognition. Should the pattern of results from our interim analyses hold after completion of data collection, results indicate that active stimulation to the rTPJ has a unique impact on dynamic emotional stimuli, improving visual attention and accuracy in emotion recognition, suggesting a primary role of the rTPJ and visual attention in performance on this task. The intricate design of this study allows for thorough investigation of potential mechanisms by which social cognitive deficits develop, and the use of novel experimental techniques align with the theme of this year\\u2019s conference.\",\"published_in\":\"Schizophrenia Bulletin ; volume 46, issue Supplement_1, page S161-S162 ; ISSN 0586-7614 1745-1701\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"subject\":\"Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"authors\":\"Klein, Hans; Pinkham, Amy\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/schbul\\/sbaa030.381\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"d51cb2628e079a1549b9afc6aac40c0aed98a391bfa6a14bea1b2f9419f1d175\",\"relevance\":70},{\"id\":\"087713501ac5c1c449db7dd8906bde2fe2d2711bfb28fd490ebc08b982ea825d\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/schbul\\/sbaa029.787; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/schizophreniabulletin\\/article-pdf\\/46\\/Supplement_1\\/S319\\/33286416\\/sbaa029.787.pdf\",\"title\":\"T227. VIRTUAL REALITY SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING IMPROVES SOCIAL ATTENTION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Social impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia presenting a major barrier to recovery. Although antipsychotic medications can reduce psychotic symptoms, social impairments often persist, contributing to poor outcome. Validated interventions, such as Social Skills Training (Bellack et al., 2004), target a broad range of social domains but they yield only modest effect sizes for social outcome (Pfammatter et al, 2006). Moreover, conventional social interventions suffer from high burden on the clients and therapists, low adherence, lack of personalization, and low generalizability. Importantly, social interventions are not widely available. Virtual reality (VR) offers a viable alternative to conventional therapies with several advantages including high acceptability, an extensive repertoire of stimuli, low-burden, low-cost and safety (Strickland, 1997). Importantly, VR allows for a precise targeting of social cognitive mechanisms. Social attention, the fast orientation and allocation of resources to social stimuli can be indexed by tracking eye movements. Abnormal eye scanning behavior during social interactions has been linked to poor social functioning in schizophrenia (Brunet-Gouet & Decety, 2006). We designed a VR-based social skills training game to directly target social attention in schizophrenia. Methods Eighteen individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) participated in the VR training game twice a week for 5 weeks. Eye movement patterns were recorded throughout the training. Subjects were required to solve social \\u201cmissions\\u201d (e.g., obtain personal information through conversations with avatars) in different naturalistic scenarios. To start a mission, participants had to fixate on the chosen avatar. The latency to engage in a social interaction was indexed by the fixation time (social engagement latency). Each session consisted of 12 missions. We compared social engagement latency and eye gaze patterns pre- and post-training to assess the efficacy of the VR social skills training program. Results Social engagement latency significantly decreased after 10 sessions (d=0.78). This result suggests that prosocial attention benefitted from VR training. We also found that the standard deviation of dwell time (i.e., proportion of time spent looking at the avatar\\u2019s face during a conversation) significantly increased across training sessions (d=0.56). This result suggests an increased modulation of interpersonal engagement during social interaction. Additionally, participants\\u2019 emotion recognition ability significantly increased (\\u03b72 = 0.27), and negative symptoms significantly decreased (\\u03b72=0.34) from pre- to post- training. Importantly, these changes in social attention correlated with improvement in negative symptoms. Discussion Simulated and targeted social interactions with avatars in VR significantly improved social attention in individuals with schizophrenia. Importantly, improvements in negative symptoms and emotion perception after training suggest that this training protocol has an impact on a broad range of social functions. VR training is a promising alternative to traditional psychosocial interventions to target specific mechanisms underlying social functioning in schizophrenia.\",\"published_in\":\"Schizophrenia Bulletin ; volume 46, issue Supplement_1, page S319-S319 ; ISSN 0586-7614 1745-1701\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"subject\":\"Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"authors\":\"Torregrossa, L\\u00e9nie; Ichinose, Megan; Hieber Adery, Laura; Nichols, Heathman; Wade, Joshua; Bian, Dayi; Granholm, Eric; Sarkar, Nilanjan; Park, Sohee\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/schbul\\/sbaa029.787\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"087713501ac5c1c449db7dd8906bde2fe2d2711bfb28fd490ebc08b982ea825d\",\"relevance\":69},{\"id\":\"74c587c941995942ee7fb73da3f4309cc8ef57d869e8945b0338ef53d7f9ba8a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01345\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1664-1078; 1664-1078; doi:10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01345; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7bcf64ab2f6743e0a51ac225701df972\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01345; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7bcf64ab2f6743e0a51ac225701df972\",\"title\":\"Natural Environment and Social Relationship in the Development of Attentional Network\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The attention mechanism is related to both voluntary and automatic processes, that may be summarized in three distinct networks: alert, orientation, and inhibitory control. These networks can be modulated by different contextual and relational situations. Aim of this review is to explain how a combination of natural and social stimuli can positively affect the attentional processes. It has been proposed that the exposition to natural environment can positively affect direct attention, a common resource supporting both executive functioning and self-regulation processes in cognition. It has been suggested that the decrease of the effort required to voluntary control attention from the bottom upwards could determine some internal reflection that may support creative thinking secondarily to a simultaneous reduction in the effort required to orient attention between thoughts and impressions. In my view, not only exposition to natural and green environment improves attentional processes but also the involvement in social relationship. The development of the orientation and inhibitory control networks is sensitive to the social nature of the stimuli, for instance, in a task, including socially relevant stimuli the efficiency of these two attentional networks increases in children, in adults and in elderly subjects. Social attention, starting very early in the life (joint attention) is a very important mechanism for the regulation of social relationships. A key for a better development of cognitive functions such as attentional processes is the promotion of the immersion in the natural environment and the involvement in social relationship.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Francesca Federico\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01345\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"74c587c941995942ee7fb73da3f4309cc8ef57d869e8945b0338ef53d7f9ba8a\",\"relevance\":68},{\"id\":\"3ed614e640187494e80ec2b8c769d8cabb7faafedd9f81294aa64852baa08053\",\"relation\":\"SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE; http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/31690; doi:10.1093\\/scan\\/nsaa038\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/31690; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/scan\\/nsaa038\",\"title\":\"Neural correlates of negative expectancy and impaired social feedback processing in social anxiety\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Social anxiety has been associated with abnormalities in cognitive processing in the literature, manifesting as various cognitive biases.

An Eye Tracking Analysis\",\"paper_abstract\":\"BackgroundVisual atypicalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are a well documented phenomenon, beginning as early as 2\\u20136 months of age and manifesting in a significantly decreased attention to the eyes, direct gaze and socially salient information. Early emerging neurobiological deficits in perceiving social stimuli as rewarding or its active avoidance due to the anxiety it entails have been widely purported as potential reasons for this atypicality. Parallel research evidence also points to the significant benefits of animal presence for reducing social anxiety and enhancing social interaction in children with autism. While atypicality in social attention in ASD has been widely substantiated, whether this atypicality persists equally across species types or is confined to humans has not been a key focus of research insofar.MethodsWe attempted a comprehensive examination of the differences in visual attention to static images of human and animal faces (40 images; 20 human faces and 20 animal faces) among children with ASD using an eye tracking paradigm. 44 children (ASD n = 21; TD n = 23) participated in the study (10,362 valid observations) across five regions of interest (left eye, right eye, eye region, face and screen).ResultsResults obtained revealed significantly greater social attention across human and animal stimuli in typical controls when compared to children with ASD. However in children with ASD, a significantly greater attention allocation was seen to animal faces and eye region and lesser attention to the animal mouth when compared to human faces, indicative of a clear attentional preference to socially salient regions of animal stimuli. The positive attentional bias toward animals was also seen in terms of a significantly greater visual attention to direct gaze in animal images.ConclusionOur results suggest the possibility that atypicalities in social attention in ASD may not be uniform across species. It adds to the current neural and biomarker evidence base of the potentially greater social reward processing and lesser social anxiety underlying animal stimuli as compared to human stimuli in children with ASD.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"animals; autism (ASD); social attention; visual attention; eye tracking; human animal interaction (HAI); Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"animals; autism (ASD); social attention; visual attention; eye tracking; human animal interaction (HAI); Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Georgitta J.

Therefore, adults\\u2019 social biases affect not only attention, but also their memory. Six-to-ten year-old children and young adults took part in the current study, employing a combination of behavioural and eye-tracking measures. Social stimuli in naturalistic scenes distracted both children and adults during visual search, as demonstrated by their gaze behavior and search times. In addition, eye-tracking revealed even greater attentional capture by social distractors for children. Memory for targets was worse in social compared to non-social scenes. Intriguingly, children demonstrated overall better memory precision than adults. Finally, when participants detected previously learnt targets within visual scenes, adults were slower for targets appearing at unexpected (invalid) locations within social scenes compared to non-social scenes, but this was not the case for children. In their entirety, these findings suggest that the interplay between social attentional biases, memory and memory-guided attention is complex and modulated by age-related differences.

Investigators have found that there is a continuum of autism-like traits in the general population, suggesting that these autistic traits may be examined in the absence of clinically diagnosed autism. To provide evidence for the continuum of autistic traits in terms of social attention and to provide insights into social attention deficits in people with autism, the current study was conducted to examine the effect of autistic traits of typically developing individuals on social orienting using a spatial cueing paradigm. The typically developing individuals who participated in this study were divided into high autistic traits (HA) and low autistic traits groups using the Autism Quotient scale. All participants completed a spatial cueing task in which social cues (gaze) and non-social cues (arrow) were presented under different cue predictability conditions (predictive vs. non-predictive) with different SOAs (100 ms vs. 400 ms). The results showed that compared to low autistic individuals, high autistic individuals had less benefit from non-predictive social cues but greater benefit from non-social ones, providing evidence that such spatial attention impairment in high autistic individuals is specific to the social domain. Interestingly, the smaller benefit from non-predictive social cues in high autistic individuals was shown only in the 400 ms condition, not in the 100 ms condition, suggesting that their difficulties in orienting to non-predictive social cues may be caused by a deficiency in spontaneously effortful control processing.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits; attention orienting; social cues; non-social cues; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits; attention orienting; social cues; non-social cues; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Guoyao Lin; Yanling Cui; Jiajing Zeng; Liang Huang\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00794\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"6475837784f5361d16f24aabf3380982509c91895ee5531be6929b85bc6f75d9\",\"relevance\":62},{\"id\":\"529bb490986703ae4009d59848ce402280d76198fc631be87fdd155af6a98845\",\"relation\":\"Cognition; Siposova , B & Carpenter , M 2019 , ' A new look at joint attention and common knowledge ' , Cognition , vol. 189 , pp. 260-274 . https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.cognition.2019.03.019; 0010-0277; PURE: 258686813; PURE UUID: e57476c6-5d8d-4355-9023-a3a54c148dad; Scopus: 85064467592; WOS: 000472693900024; ORCID: \\/0000-0003-3983-2034\\/work\\/64697970; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10023\\/19824; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.cognition.2019.03.019\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10023\\/19824; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.cognition.2019.03.019\",\"title\":\"A new look at joint attention and common knowledge\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Everyone agrees that joint attention is a key feature of human social cognition.

A similar problem applies to common knowledge. Here we present a new approach: We outline a typology of social attention levels which are currently all referred to in the literature as joint attention (from monitoring to common, mutual, and shared attention), along with corresponding levels of common knowledge. We consider cognitive, behavioral, and phenomenological aspects of the different levels as well as their different functions, and a key distinction we make in all of this is second-personal vs. third-personal relations.

What is less well known, however, is whether such attentional capture also occurs in a wider social context, such as when observing people in pain. In order to explore this possibility, we adopted a novel social-cue detection methodology: the bodies-in-the-crowd task. Two experiments are reported that consider whether nonverbal cues of pain, happiness and anger as expressed through body postures would capture and hold attention. Both experiments recruited 40 (20 male, 20 female) pain-free individuals. Overall, results show that pain postures do not capture attention any more than happiness or anger postures, but disengagement from pain postures was significantly slower across both studies. Gender differences were also found, and were more likely to be found, when crowds comprised both men and women. Male pain postures were more likely to capture attention. Whilst female observers had faster target detection speed, and were quicker to disengage from distractors. They also showed slower disengagement from female expressions overall. Male observers showed no variation based on target or distractor gender. Implications and potential directions for future research are discussed.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-03-19\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Walsh, J; Eccleston, C; Keogh, E\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk\\/13151\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"436d3fc28f03e67d3388bf0e0715b5c482c24d94b70e522b78c806573b61c2da\",\"relevance\":59},{\"id\":\"e896c06f94117f80492a83303fc9b103b19daabe0f0e193bb567d7a93a72a708\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1038\\/s41598-020-61523-z; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2045-2322; doi:10.1038\\/s41598-020-61523-z; 2045-2322; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/47554f844d9a462d84543c12eb358cb2\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/s41598-020-61523-z; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/47554f844d9a462d84543c12eb358cb2\",\"title\":\"Unraveling the Origin of Social Bursts in Collective Attention\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract In the era of social media, every day billions of individuals produce content in socio-technical systems resulting in a deluge of information. However, human attention is a limited resource and it is increasingly challenging to consume the most suitable content for one\\u2019s interests. In fact, the complex interplay between individual and social activities in social systems overwhelmed by information results in bursty activity of collective attention which are still poorly understood. Here, we tackle this challenge by analyzing the online activity of millions of users in a popular microblogging platform during exceptional events, from NBA Finals to the elections of Pope Francis and the discovery of gravitational waves. We observe extreme fluctuations in collective attention that we are able to characterize and explain by considering the co-occurrence of two fundamental factors: the heterogeneity of social interactions and the preferential attention towards influential users. Our findings demonstrate how combining simple mechanisms provides a route towards understanding complex social phenomena.\",\"published_in\":\"Scientific Reports, Vol 10, Iss 1, Pp 1-9 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"subject\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"authors\":\"Manlio De Domenico; Eduardo G.

An extensive elaborate study on concepts relating to attention and consciousness dissociation has been done. In this article we also narrow it down to experimental design that requires independent manipulation of each. Which include top-down attention and awareness aspect of consciousness? Main Findings: Many researches have been put forward supporting the independent nature of attention from awareness using sophisticated experimental and physiological shreds of evidence. On the other hand, some researches still stick to the contemporary common-sense notion of no awareness no attention. Our evaluation suggests an independent nature of attention and awareness. Application: This article intends to give a clear perspective of the ongoing debate on the relationship between attention and consciousness.

Access to attentional resources was manipulated by sometimes including a distracting stimulus among the presented stimuli. The results of Study 1 revealed that a significant self-referential reward effect emerged under undistracted attentional conditions and was associated with improved task performance when self-owned monetary rewards were available. However, distracted attention impaired this self-referential reward effect. Moreover, distracted attention was also observed in the self-referential social reward processing in Study 2.

Specifically, this paper argues that - and why - the exploration of content policies and their enforcement is indispensable when approaching social media platforms and social media data in particular from a critical perspective. A number of researchers have already begun to identify contextual elements that require particular attention when viewing social media and social media data through a CDS lens. However, social media sites' content policies, as pervasive contextual element, have not received adequate research attention yet. Drawing on Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis (CMDA) and recent developments in Social Media CDS (SM-CDS), this paper first demonstrates the existing gap in research. Then, it contends that social media sites' content policies deserve more detailed attention in SM-CDS, argues why this is the case and elaborates on the different aspects of content policies and policy enforcement that require examination. After detailed theoretical discussion of this, empirical evidence to support this argument is presented in the form of a case study of Wikipedia and Wikipedia data.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"social media; CDS; SM-CDS; content policies; Wikipedia\",\"subject\":\"social media; CDS;  content policies; Wikipedia\",\"authors\":\"Kopf, Susanne\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/epub.wu.ac.at\\/7109\\/1\\/01-Kopf.pdf\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"0f0ed249fee07f522d2dc51231d22e3665f04af3cbac2b7647d070e03a80ff17\",\"relevance\":49},{\"id\":\"30b58d89fffc50d969d887f31e59c0ce170fcc9d03c957774b8ca1a336c8f94b\",\"relation\":\"CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING; J00688; 2152-2715; OAK-2019-01406; https:\\/\\/ir.ymlib.yonsei.ac.kr\\/handle\\/22282913\\/169944; doi:10.1089\\/cyber.2018.0377; 2152-2723; 30672714; https:\\/\\/www.liebertpub.com\\/doi\\/abs\\/10.1089\\/cyber.2018.0377; T201901554\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ir.ymlib.yonsei.ac.kr\\/handle\\/22282913\\/169944; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1089\\/cyber.2018.0377; https:\\/\\/www.liebertpub.com\\/doi\\/abs\\/10.1089\\/cyber.2018.0377\",\"title\":\"Development of Virtual Reality Continuous Performance Test Utilizing Social Cues for Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit\\/Hyperactivity Disorder\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Virtual reality (VR) neuropsychological assessments have the potential for the ecological measurement of attention. We analyzed the newly developed VR continuous performance test (VR-CPT) for Korean children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC). To identify specific features of a virtual environment that influence the attention performance of children, we investigated whether the presence of a virtual teacher and social cues in the VR environment affects their attention performance. A total of 38 participants (18 TDC and 20 ADHD children and adolescents) were recruited for VR-CPT testing. Bivariate correlational analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the results of the VR-CPT and ADHD questionnaires to determine the capacity of VR-CPT to mirror real-life attention behaviors. Mixed-design analysis of variables was conducted to compare the effects of the social aspects of the VR-CPT on attention performance in groups. There were significant associations between ADHD rating scores and the omission error, commission error, reaction time (RT), reaction time variability (RTV), and total accuracy of the VR-CPT in the ADHD group. In addition, the ADHD group exhibited comparable performance with the TDC group for all measures of the VR-CPT. Also there seemed to be a trend of decreasing RTV when a virtual teacher with social cues was present compared with the equipment control condition in the ADHD group. Performance in the VR-CPT program was associated with behavioral measures of ADHD symptoms. Adding social aspects to a VR environment commonly encountered by children and adolescents has the potential to make a difference in the attention performance of youths with ADHD. ; restriction\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/classification; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/diagnosis; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/psychology; Child; Cues*; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests*; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality*; attention; continuous performance test; neuropsychological assessment; social cues; virtual reality\",\"subject\":\"Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/classification; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/diagnosis; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/psychology; Child; Cues*; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests*; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality*; attention; continuous performance test; neuropsychological assessment; social cues; virtual reality\",\"authors\":\"\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ir.ymlib.yonsei.ac.kr\\/handle\\/22282913\\/169944\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"30b58d89fffc50d969d887f31e59c0ce170fcc9d03c957774b8ca1a336c8f94b\",\"relevance\":48},{\"id\":\"9176644b8d1694d98546f207af455a3af50fa9de4be49f689d1afcf8be516c02\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk\\/31208\\/1\\/Gregory,%20Bolderston%20and%20Antolin%202018%20accepted%20manuscript.pdf; Gregory, N.

No further differences in eye movements were found, nor in gaze-following behaviour, although these null effects could potentially result from the relatively small sample.

Previous work on joint attention has shown that even minimal shared experiences such as watching something together facilitates social closeness between individuals. Here, we examined whether young children already connect with others through joint attention. In the current studies, children sat next to a novel adult who either watched a film with them or was not able to see the film and read a book instead. After the video, we measured children\\u2019s willingness (i.e., latency) to approach the experimenter holding out a toy. In both studies, the 2.5-year-olds who watched the film together approached more quickly than the other children. These results show that both minimally interactive shared experiences and noninteractive shared experiences lead children to feel more comfortable with a novel adult. This suggests that joint attention interactions, and shared experiences in general, play an important role not only in children\\u2019s cognitive development but also in their social development and the formation of their social relationships.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wolf, W.; Tomasello, M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/21.11116\\/0000-0005-5A5C-0\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"aab5577b53689f18c394ed631097843f058c1989b74ada7eaacebff8be77d993\",\"relevance\":45},{\"id\":\"707abda48899f3713221e898e2011b55738994cd5d345532c6b596d936b9a650\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2589853\",\"title\":\"Establishment of Stability in Social Interest and Other Prerequisites for Communication in People with Profound Learning Difficulties\",\"paper_abstract\":\"When we interact with people with profound learning difficulties, we often experience that the contact breaks down.

To stabilize attention in these people we need models that include all these different dimensions.

A limitation of this literature is the lack of empirical work that has explicitly characterized how this relationship manifests itself over time. We investigate this issue by analysing data from two large eye-tracking datasets (total n = 176). Via growth-curve analysis, we demonstrate that self-reported empathy (as measured by the empathy quotient\\u2014EQ) predicts the temporal evolution of gaze behaviour under conditions where social and non-social stimuli compete for attention. In both datasets, we found that EQ not only predicted a global increase in social attention, but predicted a different temporal profile of social attention. Specifically, we detected a reliable effect of empathy on gaze towards social images after prolonged viewing. An analysis of switch latencies revealed that low-EQ observers switched gaze away from an initially fixated social image more frequently and at earlier latencies than high-EQ observers. Our analyses demonstrate that modelling these temporal components of gaze signals may reveal useful behavioural phenotypes. The explanatory power of this approach may provide enhanced biomarkers for conditions marked by deficits in empathy-related processes.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Hedger, Nicholas; Haffey, Anthony; McSorley, Eugene; Chakrabarti, Bhismadev\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/centaur.reading.ac.uk\\/81241\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"74e0d79ab150a8cd08f6d0a4bbf9df2ffbfb5abaea6999e2fb6ab6523f002147\",\"relevance\":43},{\"id\":\"e544be00645c08a5868da981e8e4790c92939f4cddb3192145130e07c5e71d25\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11937\\/79283; doi:10.1016\\/j.actpsy.2020.103024\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11937\\/79283; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.actpsy.2020.103024\",\"title\":\"Searching for emotion: A top-down set governs attentional orienting to facial expressions\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Research indicates that humans orient attention toward facial expressions of emotion. Orienting to facial expressions has typically been conceptualised as due to bottom-up attentional capture. However, this overlooks the contributions of top-down attention and selection history. In the present study, across four experiments, these three attentional processes were differentiated using a variation of the dot-probe task, in which participants were cued to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial. Results show that attention toward facial expressions was not exclusively driven by bottom-up attentional capture; instead, participants could shift their attention toward both happy and angry faces in a top-down manner. This effect was not found when the faces were inverted, indicating that top-down attention relies on holistic processing of the face. In addition, no evidence of selection history was found (i.e., no improvement on repeated trials or blocks of trials in which the task was to orient to the same expression).

As a result, less is known about the female ASD phenotype. Recent research suggests that conclusions drawn from predominantly male samples may not accurately capture female behavior. In this study, we explore potential sex differences in attention to social stimuli, which is generally reported to be diminished in ASD. Population-based sex differences in attention to faces have been reported, such that typically developing (TD) females attend more to social stimuli (including faces) from infancy through adulthood than TD males. It is yet unknown whether population-based sex differences in the face domain are preserved in ASD. Methods A dynamic, naturalistic infrared eye-tracking paradigm measured attention to social stimuli (faces) in 74 school-aged males and females with ASD (male N = 23; female N = 19) and without ASD (male N = 16; female N = 16). Two kinds of video stimuli were presented that varied in social content: rich social scenes (dyadic play between two children) and lean social scenes (parallel play by two children). Results Results revealed a significant 3-way interaction between sex, diagnosis, and condition after controlling for chronological and mental age. ASD females attended more to faces than ASD males in the socially lean condition. This effect was not found in the typically developing (TD) group. ASD males attended less to faces regardless of social context; however, ASD females only attended significantly less to faces compared to TD females in the socially rich condition. TD males and ASD females did not differ in their attention to faces in either condition. Conclusions This study has implications for how the field understands core social deficits in children with ASD, which should ideally be benchmarked against same-sex peers (male and female). Social attention in ASD females fell on a continuum\\u2014greater than their ASD male peers, but not as great as TD females. Overall, their social attention mirrored that of TD males. Improved understanding of the female social phenotype in ASD will enhance early screening and diagnostic efforts and will guide the development of sex-sensitive experimental paradigms and social interventions.\",\"published_in\":\"Molecular Autism, Vol 10, Iss 1, Pp 1-10 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Autism spectrum disorder; Sex differences; Social cognition; Eye gaze; Social attention; Neurology.

The attention score is autonomously generated by the system and depends on face attention and joint attention cues and sound responses. The scoring system allows us to prove that the customized interaction system increases the engagement and attention capabilities of ASD patients.

At the same time, the logic of industrial production continues to demand human beings to develop automated gestures commanded by the planetary assembly line, intellectual gestures being now added to bodily gestures. This automation of our \\\"endo-attention\\\" cannot be considered as a temporary step in the process leading to full automation. On the one hand, it coexists and goes along with the logic of \\\"heteromation\\\", whereby supposedly automated procedures are actually performed by micro-taskers, click farms and Mechanical Turks. On the other hand, the precarisation of labour conditions analysed by Franco Berardi tends to segment our activity into pre-formatted time-cells which alienate us from the very tasks we accomplish. While our endo-attention threatens to be automated through and through, progress in deep learning programming allows exo-attention to become creative: what used to be the specificity of human attention (i.e., its capacity to extract a meaningful figure from a given background) can now be obtained by unsupervised machine learning. Does all this mean that the creativity of human attention has been merely displaced, from creatively paying attention to (a limited number of) things, to creatively devising algorithms that pay attention to (a higher number of) things? This perspective could be technologically attractive, if it weren't trapped within the constraints of neoliberal capitalism. Social-not technological-logics should be the main cause of our concern (and anxiety) about automation. Neoliberal capitalism tends to globally align the infinite diversity of our individual attentions under one single hegemonic imperative to maximize financial profit. This is both egocidal, as it automatizes our endo-attention subjected to segmented tasks that no longer make sense to us (pre-empting emancipatory forms of subjectification), and eco-cidal, as the race for short-term profit vandalizes our social and natural environments. We therefore need to sharpen our analyses (and anxieties), in order to deflect our fear of automation towards a rejection of neoliberal capitalism. Attention in Crisis?

The results revealed that the CM group had a significantly lower percentage of gaze fixation for the human face eye area and lower salivary OT levels compared to the typical development group. Moreover, a path analysis suggested that gaze fixation for the eye area was a mediator of the relationship between salivary OT levels and social-emotional problems in the CM group.

The present study addresses the impact of early language experience on attention to faces in infancy. It was hypothesized that infants learning two spoken languages (unimodal bilinguals) and hearing infants of Deaf mothers learning British Sign Language and spoken English (bimodal bilinguals) would show enhanced attention to faces compared to monolinguals. The comparison between unimodal and bimodal bilinguals allowed differentiation of the effects of learning two languages, from the effects of increased visual communication in hearing infants of Deaf mothers. Data is presented for two independent samples of infants: Sample 1 included 49 infants between 7 and 10 months (26 monolinguals and 23 unimodal bilinguals), and Sample 2 included 87 infants between 4 and 8 months (32 monolinguals, 25 unimodal bilinguals, and 30 bimodal bilingual infants with a Deaf mother). Eye-tracking was used to analyze infants\\u2019 visual scanning of complex arrays including a face and 4 other stimulus categories. Infants from 4 to 10 months (all groups combined) directed their attention to faces faster than to non-face stimuli (i.e. attention capture), directed more fixations to and looked longer at faces than non-face stimuli (i.e. attention maintenance).

At the same time, the logic of industrial production continues to demand human beings to develop automated gestures commanded by the planetary assembly line, intellectual gestures being now added to bodily gestures. This automation of our \\\"endo-attention\\\" cannot be considered as a temporary step in the process leading to full automation. On the one hand, it coexists and goes along with the logic of \\\"heteromation\\\", whereby supposedly automated procedures are actually performed by micro-taskers, click farms and Mechanical Turks. On the other hand, the precarisation of labour conditions analysed by Franco Berardi tends to segment our activity into pre-formatted time-cells which alienate us from the very tasks we accomplish. While our endo-attention threatens to be automated through and through, progress in deep learning programming allows exo-attention to become creative: what used to be the specificity of human attention (i.e., its capacity to extract a meaningful figure from a given background) can now be obtained by unsupervised machine learning. Does all this mean that the creativity of human attention has been merely displaced, from creatively paying attention to (a limited number of) things, to creatively devising algorithms that pay attention to (a higher number of) things? This perspective could be technologically attractive, if it weren't trapped within the constraints of neoliberal capitalism. Social-not technological-logics should be the main cause of our concern (and anxiety) about automation. Neoliberal capitalism tends to globally align the infinite diversity of our individual attentions under one single hegemonic imperative to maximize financial profit. This is both egocidal, as it automatizes our endo-attention subjected to segmented tasks that no longer make sense to us (pre-empting emancipatory forms of subjectification), and eco-cidal, as the race for short-term profit vandalizes our social and natural environments. We therefore need to sharpen our analyses (and anxieties), in order to deflect our fear of automation towards a rejection of neoliberal capitalism. Attention in Crisis? Our current discussions about a 'crisis of attention' are usually premised upon a number of supposedly self-evident truths, which deserve to be questioned, if not debunked.

Visual task displays occurred in silence or with a neutral or an angry voice. Voices were task-irrelevant in a single-task block, but had to be categorized by speaker sex in a dual-task block. In the single task, angry voices increased the occipital N2 component relative to neutral voices in women, but not men. In the dual task, angry voices relative to neutral voices increased occipital N1 and N2 components, as well as accuracy, in women and marginally decreased accuracy in men. Thus, in women, vocal anger produced a strong, multifaceted visual enhancement comprising attention-dependent and attention-independent processes, whereas in men, it produced a small, behavior-focused visual processing impairment that was strictly attention-dependent. In sum, these data indicate that attention and listener sex critically modulate whether and how vocal emotions shape visual perception. \\u00a9 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, not all BI children develop anxiety. Attention bias (AB) may enhance the vulnerability for anxiety in BI children, and interfere with their development of effective emotion regulation. In order to fully probe attention patterns, we used traditional measures of reaction time (RT), stationary eye-tracking, and recently emerging mobile eye-tracking measures of attention in a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds characterized as BI ( N = 23) or non-BI ( N = 58) using parent reports. There were no BI-related differences in RT or stationary eye-tracking indices of AB in a dot-probe task. However, findings in a subsample from whom eye-tracking data were collected during a live social interaction indicated that BI children ( N = 12) directed fewer gaze shifts to the stranger than non-BI children ( N = 25). Moreover, the frequency of gazes toward the stranger was positively associated with stationary AB only in BI, but not in non-BI, children. Hence, BI was characterized by a consistent pattern of attention across stationary and ambulatory measures. We demonstrate the utility of mobile eye-tracking as an effective tool to extend the assessment of attention and regulation to social interactive contexts.\",\"published_in\":\"Development and Psychopathology ; volume 31, issue 3, page 971-988 ; ISSN 0954-5794 1469-2198\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Developmental and Educational Psychology; Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"subject\":\"Developmental and Educational Psychology; Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"authors\":\"Fu, Xiaoxue; Nelson, Eric E.; Borge, Marcela; Buss, Kristin A.; P\\u00e9rez-Edgar, Koraly\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0954579419000427\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"37d5193ce5ffbb9dc085a254567b376ba89017654e096e1660fe40f7003661ea\",\"relevance\":26},{\"id\":\"07573c04b67be0a1fbd9c5283d36b9b57f92b18ccdfe7dc4f343e0d8995a431f\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/research.gold.ac.uk\\/27111\\/1\\/fpsyg-09-01943.pdf; Mercure, Evelyne <http:\\/\\/research.gold.ac.uk\\/view\\/goldsmiths\\/Mercure=3AEvelyne=3A=3A.html>; Quiroz, Isabel; Goldberg, Laura; Bowden-Howl, Harriet; Coulson, Kimberley; Gliga, Teodora; Filippi, Roberto; Bright, Peter; Johnson, Mark H. and MacSweeney, Mair\\u00e9ad. 2018.

Consequently, efforts to better understand perfectionism have potential transdiagnostic impact. One mechanism proposed to underlie perfectionism is an attention bias towards information signalling threats to perfectionism whereby people with elevated perfectionism selectively attend to threatening stimuli. Method: The present study assessed whether two core dimensions of perfectionism, perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns, are characterised by a threat-related attention bias, and whether this bias was characterised by attention being more rapidly captured by the stimuli (engagement bias), or of greater difficulty to disengage attention (disengagement bias). Participants (N = 108) completed measures of perfectionistic strivings and concerns, and symptoms of psychological distress before completing a modified dot-probe task to measure attention biases. Attention bias index scores were calculated across three factors: engagement bias vs disengagement bias, perfectionism relevant vs irrelevant stimuli, and negative vs positive emotional stimuli. Results: Overall, perfectionistic concerns were associated with a disengagement bias for negative stimuli, regardless of whether stimuli were perfectionism relevant or not. No other significant main or interaction effects were observed. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional in design, and no temporal or causal inferences could be made. Additionally, participants were from a community sample and therefore replication is required in clinical populations. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that individuals higher in perfectionistic concerns experience difficulty withdrawing their attention from emotionally negative stimuli. These findings contribute new information to our theoretical understandings of perfectionism and provide support for the cognitive-behavioural model of perfectionism.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences; Science & Technology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine; Psychology; Clinical; Psychiatry; Perfectionism; Perfectionistic strivings; Perfectionistic concerns; Attention bias; Engagement; Disengagement; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ANXIETY; THREAT; SELF\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences; Science & Technology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine; Psychology; Clinical; Psychiatry; Perfectionism; Perfectionistic strivings; Perfectionistic concerns; Attention bias; Engagement; Disengagement; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ANXIETY; THREAT; SELF\",\"authors\":\"Tonta, Kate; Howell, Joel; Hasking, Penelope; Boyes, Mark; Clarke, Patrick\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11937\\/76059\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"052e7bc69c0b0b11fe78fc9fc722cfaaeb83cbd0d9024a3127cbe64e63701e0c\",\"relevance\":24},{\"id\":\"c5220d8783cc52a0c76eec3c8f9413c77ff5d1ebda5bccd18409b0cae13dc8fb\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/itp-09-2019-0490\",\"title\":\"How do digital influencers affect social commerce intention?

Practitioners have attached increasing attention to facilitating social commerce intention with influencer strategies. However, theoretical understanding or empirical investigation on the impact of digital influencers on consumers' social commerce intention is limited. This study aims to provide new insights into the drivers of two forms of social commerce intention: social shopping and social sharing intention. Based on the theoretical lens of social power, this study answers how digital influencers affect consumer satisfaction and ultimately boost their intention to conduct social commerce activities. Design\\/methodology\\/approach A field interview is conducted to determine the appropriate social power forms. An online survey on a large social commerce site in China with 310 respondents is conducted to test the proposed model. Findings Results indicate that expert power and referent power derived from digital influencers predict most of the consumers' economic satisfaction, whereas referent power and reciprocity power explain consumers' social satisfaction. Economic satisfaction affects social shopping and social sharing intention, whereas social satisfaction only influences social sharing intention.

It provides new insight into the determinants of social commerce intention.

In the first year, infants become increasingly sensitive to others' gaze and use it to focus their own attention on relevant visual input.

At the same time, the logic of industrial production continues to demand human beings to develop automated gestures commanded by the planetary assembly line, intellectual gestures being now added to bodily gestures. This automation of our \\\"endo-attention\\\" cannot be considered as a temporary step in the process leading to full automation. On the one hand, it coexists and goes along with the logic of \\\"heteromation\\\", whereby supposedly automated procedures are actually performed by micro-taskers, click farms and Mechanical Turks. On the other hand, the precarisation of labour conditions analysed by Franco Berardi tends to segment our activity into pre-formatted time-cells which alienate us from the very tasks we accomplish. While our endo-attention threatens to be automated through and through, progress in deep learning programming allows exo-attention to become creative: what used to be the specificity of human attention (i.e., its capacity to extract a meaningful figure from a given background) can now be obtained by unsupervised machine learning. Does all this mean that the creativity of human attention has been merely displaced, from creatively paying attention to (a limited number of) things, to creatively devising algorithms that pay attention to (a higher number of) things? This perspective could be technologically attractive, if it weren't trapped within the constraints of neoliberal capitalism. Social-not technological-logics should be the main cause of our concern (and anxiety) about automation. Neoliberal capitalism tends to globally align the infinite diversity of our individual attentions under one single hegemonic imperative to maximize financial profit. This is both egocidal, as it automatizes our endo-attention subjected to segmented tasks that no longer make sense to us (pre-empting emancipatory forms of subjectification), and eco-cidal, as the race for short-term profit vandalizes our social and natural environments. We therefore need to sharpen our analyses (and anxieties), in order to deflect our fear of automation towards a rejection of neoliberal capitalism. Attention in Crisis? Our current discussions about a 'crisis of attention' are usually premised upon a number of supposedly self-evident truths, which deserve to be questioned, if not debunked.

The findings show that the influence of social media brand involvement on social media brand engagement is stronger than the influence of social media brand communication. The latter is due to the co-creation of users and firms. Furthermore, interaction and attention are the most relevant components of social media brand engagement, followed by enthusiasm, identification, and absorption.

This paper draws attention to two tensions in social work advocacy; between worker-led advocacy and person-led advocacy, and between individual advocacy and system level advocacy. We argue that human-rights-based social workers must choose a person-led approach over a worker-led approach while advocating with both systems and individuals. This argument is made by drawing on findings of an evaluation of Independent Mental Health Advocacy (IMHA) in Victoria, Australia. It is shown that social work training had not prepared social workers for rights-based, person-led advocacy and that social workers in public mental health services were struggling to maintain the rights of people in their services even with assistance from IMHA. IMPLICATIONS Independent Mental Health Advocacy (IMHA) is a model of advocacy influenced by social work theory and delivered in part by social-work-trained advocates. Social work training is not preparing social workers for person-led, human-rights-based advocacy. Public mental health social workers are struggling to maintain the rights of people in mental health services even with the support of external advocacy services.\",\"published_in\":\"Australian Social Work (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Maylea, Christopher; Makregiorgos, Helen; Martin, Jennifer; Alvarez-Vasquez, Susan; Dale, Matthew; Hill, Nicholas; Johnson, Brendan; Thomas, Stuart; Weller, Penelope\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.3\\/454536\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f8e458735228ea57851802a2a2b1180e630122888be17809c4e9823056ab1c99\",\"relevance\":16},{\"id\":\"4f47ed01febe05aab1690d4f38fa028f5ef85364086f31f935ae709b21d4dfcd\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.tci-thaijo.org\\/index.php\\/husojournal\\/article\\/view\\/148493\\/122634\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.tci-thaijo.org\\/index.php\\/husojournal\\/article\\/view\\/148493\",\"title\":\"The Power of Social Media on Mobilizing the New Social Movements ; \\u0e1e\\u0e25\\u0e31\\u0e07\\u0e02\\u0e2d\\u0e07\\u0e2a\\u0e37\\u0e48\\u0e2d\\u0e2a\\u0e31\\u0e07\\u0e04\\u0e21\\u0e01\\u0e31\\u0e1a\\u0e01\\u0e32\\u0e23\\u0e02\\u0e31\\u0e1a\\u0e40\\u0e04\\u0e25\\u0e37\\u0e48\\u0e2d\\u0e19\\u0e02\\u0e1a\\u0e27\\u0e19\\u0e01\\u0e32\\u0e23\\u0e40\\u0e04\\u0e25\\u0e37\\u0e48\\u0e2d\\u0e19\\u0e44\\u0e2b\\u0e27\\u0e17\\u0e32\\u0e07\\u0e2a\\u0e31\\u0e07\\u0e04\\u0e21\\u0e43\\u0e2b\\u0e21\\u0e48\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this article, the contents involving with social media and their benefits in supporting social movements were introduced.

Recent research has suggested to extend analysis from cognitive and physical to the social and emotional demands of gameplay.

We report a re-analysis of qualitative interview data on the social norms of video gaming corroborating the model. As suggested by Goffman, video gaming features rich social norms regarding involvement. When spontaneously experienced and normatively demanded involvement misalign, players experience self-conscious disinvolvement and engage in unenjoyable, effortful self-control of their experienced and displayed involvement.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-12-20\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Deterding, Christoph Sebastian\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.whiterose.ac.uk\\/154202\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"251d7de418d0e0a0491ca9e0395b7a19f7c755a5684e7a7055b11dddefaa9bdb\",\"relevance\":12},{\"id\":\"a09295b431d83ea51604db809255d01b99196c1b637bc9ae5ec89eda1ed9b644\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.iiste.org\\/Journals\\/index.php\\/RHSS\\/article\\/view\\/49177\\/50807\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.iiste.org\\/Journals\\/index.php\\/RHSS\\/article\\/view\\/49177\",\"title\":\"Students\\u2019 Attention to Lectures: Examining the Influence of Self-Esteem and Locus of Control\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Observation has revealed that while lecture is going on, rather than paying attention, students engage themselves in irrelevant activities like fiddling with their mobile phones, sneaking out of lecture halls and so on. This study investigated the influence of Self-esteem and Locus of control on attention to lectures among undergraduates of Mass Communication department, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. A sample size of 236 students were selected for the study from a population of 577 through simple random sampling method. The samples comprised of 04 (44.1%) males and 132(55.9%) females. Their age ranged from 17-32 years, with mean age of 22 and standard deviation of 2.86. Three scales were administered to the participants, which include Index of Self-Esteem by Hudson (1982), Locus of Control Internal- External scale by Rotter (1966), and Moss Attention Rating Scale by Whyte, Hart, Bode & Male C(2003). Data were collected through survey method and was analyzed using descriptive statistics and two-way analysis of Variance. The study tested three hypotheses, the ANOVA statistics revealed a significant influence of students\\u2019 self esteem on attention to Lectures F (1,232)= 5.72, P<.05, and a non-significant influence of Locus of control on attention to Lectures F(1,232)= 1.01, P>.05. These was a non-significant interaction effect of Self-esteem and Locus of control on attention to Lectures F(1,232)= .04,P> .05. Based on the descriptive analysis, it was observed that students who scored high in their Self-esteem measures paid more attention to lectures than those who scored low.

Robust driver attention prediction for critical situations is a challenging computer vision problem, yet essential for autonomous driving. Because critical driving moments are so rare, collecting enough data for these situations is difficult with the conventional in-car data collection protocol\\u2014tracking eye movements during driving. Here, we first propose a new in-lab driver attention collection protocol and introduce a new driver attention dataset, Berkeley DeepDrive Attention (BDD-A) dataset, which is built upon braking event videos selected from a large-scale, crowd-sourced driving video dataset. We further propose Human Weighted Sampling (HWS) method, which uses human gaze behavior to identify crucial frames of a driving dataset and weights them heavily during model training. With our dataset and HWS, we built a driver attention prediction model that outperforms the state-of-the-art and demonstrates sophisticated behaviors, like attending to crossing pedestrians but not giving false alarms to pedestrians safely walking on the sidewalk. Its prediction results are nearly indistinguishable from ground-truth to humans. Although only being trained with our in-lab attention data, the model also predicts in-car driver attention data of routine driving with state-of-the-art accuracy. This result not only demonstrates the performance of our model but also proves the validity and usefulness of our dataset and data collection protocol.\",\"published_in\":\"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), vol 11365 LNCS\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Driver attention prediction; BDD-A dataset; Berkeley DeepDrive; Behavioral and Social Science; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; cs.CV; Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing\",\"subject\":\"Driver attention prediction; BDD-A dataset; Berkeley DeepDrive; Behavioral and Social Science; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research;; CV; Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing\",\"authors\":\"Xia, Y; Zhang, D; Kim, J; Nakayama, K; Zipser, K; Whitney, D\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/escholarship.org\\/uc\\/item\\/0vx1h4j4\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ff31cdbcfc7278d29f2c9814fdaac12abaf3daaa250ebdc832f394d2d3c3f0de\",\"relevance\":10},{\"id\":\"61fea180cda4d8034dee0f3c19d161fd9e2b1de0cf94d9874fa501cf2e502b3e\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.lppmunindra.ac.id\\/index.php\\/herodotus\\/article\\/view\\/2863\",\"title\":\"Pengaruh Perhatian Orang Tua dan Persepsi Siswa Atas Kompetensi Guru Terhadap Prestasi Belajar Ilmu Pengetahuan Sosial\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This research is a survey and aims to find and analyze empirically the influence of parents 'attention on the learning achievement of Social Sciences, students' perceptions of teacher competence on learning achievement of Social Sciences, the influence of parental attention and students 'perceptions of teachers' competence collectively against Social Science learning achievement.

Social support, family environment conditions and the neighboring social environment are components of social capital that contribute to the health of pregnant women. The Indonesia Healthy Family-Program Approach (HIP-FA) supports efforts to empower families to provide social support to pregnant women, thereby increasing self-efficacy in pregnancy that will lead to giving birth to healthy babies. This paper aims to describe the social capital and efficacy of pregnant women. Method: This study was a qualitative study that described social capital, empowerment, and self-efficacy of pregnant women during pregnancy. The article search was through PubMed, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords used to search the articles included: pregnant women, self-efficacy, social capital, and empowerment. The author examined and synthesized various kinds of literature that were closely related to social capital in providing self-efficacy for pregnant women. Results: Social capital affects health and is the main determinant of health. The important social capital is social support for pregnant women by empowering families to give better attention during pregnancy. A healthy Indonesian program with a family approach (HIP-FA) is organized in order to increase the government's attention in overcoming health problems by involving family directly in planning activities, monitoring and evaluation processes, so that the families understand well the health problems of pregnant women in their families and can provide social support in dealing with mental health disorders of pregnant women and increasing self-confidence to be mothers and parent. Conclusion: Social support is a social capital that can improve family empowerment by paying more attention to the health of pregnant women. Social capital in the form of family cohesion and family environment can improve the self-efficacy of pregnant women and prevent pregnancy complications to prepare for the birth of a healthy baby.\",\"published_in\":\"Kes Mas: Jurnal Fakultas Kesehatan Masyarakat; Vol 13, No 2 (2019): Kes Mas: Jurnal Fakultas Kesehatan Masyarakat; 84-91 ; 1978-0575\",\"year\":\"2019-09-30\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Capital; Family Empowerment; Self-Efficacy; Pregnant Women\",\"subject\":\"Social Capital; Family Empowerment; Self-Efficacy; Pregnant Women\",\"authors\":\"Kusumawati, Yuli; Supriyati, Supriyati\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uad.ac.id\\/index.php\\/KesMas\\/article\\/view\\/12049\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"3dd0240ed8f8c7e2a8fa4e0ac1fad8527fc0603b691c8c231e36e70fd369c386\",\"relevance\":8},{\"id\":\"67361ecd3665ac0d862146214724885919e7885384c61aa9033af7d47c0cb7c3\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00035\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1664-1078; 1664-1078; doi:10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00035; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e66c976b056a41c8be1cf8735cc99238\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00035; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e66c976b056a41c8be1cf8735cc99238\",\"title\":\"Gaze Behavior in Social Fear Conditioning: An Eye-Tracking Study in Virtual Reality\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The vigilance-avoidance hypothesis of selective attention assumes that socially anxious persons initially direct their attention toward fear-related stimuli and subsequently avoid these social stimuli to reduce emotional distress. New technical developments provide tools to implicit measure overt attention on fear-related stimuli via eye-tracking in ecological valid virtual environments presented via a head-mounted display. We examined in 27 low (LSA) and 26 high socially anxious (HSA) individuals fear ratings, physical behavior (duration of approach), hypervigilance (time to first fixation), and attentional avoidance (count of fixations) toward virtual female and male agents (CS) during social fear conditioning (SFC) and extinction in virtual reality (VR). As hypothesized, generally SFC was successfully induced and extinguished concerning the fear ratings. Our findings partly support the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis as HSA directed especially at the first half of the fear acquisition their initial attention more at CS+ than CS\\u2212 agents, and avoided subsequently the CS+ more than the CS\\u2212 agents during the fear acquisition. In contrast, in LSA participants initial and sustained attention did not differ between CS+ and CS\\u2212 agents during fear acquisition. We conclude that HSA individuals guide their initial attention to emotionally threatening stimuli and subsequently avoid the threatening stimuli to possibly reduce their emotional distress, whereas LSA individuals regulate themselves less in their (fear) responses during SFC. Measuring implicit gaze behavior within a well-controlled virtual environment is an interesting innovative tool to in deeply investigate the impact of attention on emotional learning processes.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"social anxiety disorder; social fear conditioning; vigilance-avoidance hypothesis; eye-tracking; virtual reality; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"social anxiety disorder; social fear conditioning; vigilance-avoidance hypothesis; eye-tracking; virtual reality; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Jonas Reichenberger; Michael Pfaller; Andreas M\\u00fchlberger\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00035\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"67361ecd3665ac0d862146214724885919e7885384c61aa9033af7d47c0cb7c3\",\"relevance\":7},{\"id\":\"fc8379c8eaeb5a7cf229ae74d5af0317f7768e0d58060f5139a504c1704b20b1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2076-0760\\/7\\/12\\/262; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2076-0760; 2076-0760; doi:10.3390\\/socsci7120262; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/931888f352954cd9a088fa0b0c7e90eb\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/socsci7120262; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/931888f352954cd9a088fa0b0c7e90eb\",\"title\":\"Editorial: Tourism and Social Regeneration\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Research on social regeneration is a very specific area that needs more attention in the tourism and social sciences literature.

Traditional measures of the impact of a paper do not account for this. Altmetrics are a measure of the dissemination of a publication via social media websites. The purpose of this study is to ascertain if the altmetric attention score of an article is a reliable measure of the impact it has in the field of critical care medicine. To this end, we investigated if a correlation exists between future citation count and altmetric attention score. Methods The top nine journals by impact factor in the field of critical care medicine were identified for 2014 and 2015. The 100 most cited articles from these journals were recorded to form the Scientific Impact Group, i.e. those with the greatest impact on the scientific community. The altmetric attention score was recorded for each article. The top 100 articles by altmetric attention score were also identified to form the Media Impact Group, i.e. those that generated the most online attention. Their citation counts\\u2019 were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed on each group to identify a correlation between altmetric attention score and citation count. Results There was a moderately positive correlation in the Scientific Impact Group, with a Spearman r score of 0.4336 ( P = 0.0001). A weakly positive correlation was found in the Media Impact Group, with a Spearman r score of 0.3033 ( P = 0.002). Conclusions There is a positive correlation between traditional bibliographic metrics and altmetrics in the field of critical care medicine. Highly cited papers are more likely to generate online attention. However, papers that generate a lot of online attention are less likely to have a high citation count. Therefore, altmetric attention score is not a reliable predictor of future citation count in critical care medicine.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of the Intensive Care Society ; page 175114372090324 ; ISSN 1751-1437\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Critical Care; Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine\",\"subject\":\"Critical Care; Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine\",\"authors\":\"Lehane, Daniel J; Black, Colin S\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1751143720903240\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"3046d7cb7cfa8eaf6ad0155a72f0f848671104f751d23549190c0f0965dd14ba\",\"relevance\":4},{\"id\":\"d62f92060a11366b5e24d68cc26aec72a48c01a61bdbd62147d07e65da9c0e7f\",\"relation\":\"0010-9452; http:\\/\\/dspace.library.uu.nl\\/handle\\/1874\\/390211\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dspace.library.uu.nl\\/handle\\/1874\\/390211\",\"title\":\"The influence of joint attention and partner trustworthiness on cross-modal sensory cueing\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Joint attention refers to the coordinated attention between social partners to an object of shared interest, usually involving shared gaze toward the object. In the laboratory, however, joint attention is often investigated using computerized gaze cueing tasks that do not allow shared gaze. Instead, these computerized tasks require the participant to maintain fixation on the virtual partner's face, while the partner gazes to the left or right. Here we designed a modified gaze cueing task that better simulates a natural joint attention episode by allowing shared gaze, while still maintaining tight experimental control. In our computerized task the participant's gaze and the gaze of a virtual partner were manipulated independently, resulting in shared or unshared gaze. Following each gaze shift of the virtual partner a touch stimulus was delivered on one of the cheeks of the participant. We analyzed behavioral and neural (electro-encephalography) responses to the touch. Faster reaction-times and stronger lateralization of alpha power were observed when the touched cheek was in a jointly attended hemispace compared with a singly attended or unattended hemispace. Importantly, these effects were unique to joint attention and could not be explained as the additive effects of own gaze and gaze cue direction. Underlining its social nature, we found that the behavioral effect was absent when we repeated our experiment with nonsocial cues (arrows) instead of gaze cues. Furthermore, when we compared trustworthy with untrustworthy virtual partners (trustworthiness judgements based on facial appearance) we found the effect only for trustworthy and not for untrustworthy virtual partners. We conclude that joint attention based on shared gaze influences attentional orienting such that cross-modal sensory processing at the jointly attended location is facilitated, particularly when the partner is trustworthy. This indicates that social interactions and trustworthiness judgements affect cortical and behavioral responses to sensory information.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-10-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Alpha oscillations; Gaze following; Joint attention; Trustworthiness; Visuo-tactile cueing; Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology; Experimental and Cognitive Psychology; Cognitive Neuroscience\",\"subject\":\"Alpha oscillations; Gaze following; Joint attention; Trustworthiness; Visuo-tactile cueing; Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology; Experimental and Cognitive Psychology; Cognitive Neuroscience\",\"authors\":\"de Jong, Maartje C.; Dijkerman, H.

This finding has been interpreted as an example of the human bias for misattributing observed ambiguous gaze signals as self-directed eye contact.

Although training for top-down attentional control has been an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder, few studies have demonstrated that individuals with social anxiety have top-down attentional dysfunction. This study used dichotic listening (DL) tasks to investigate the relationship between social anxiety and top-down attentional control over relevant brain activities. We also investigated relationships between both social situation-dependent self-focused attention and external attention bias and situation-independent attentional control. Thirty-six healthy participants underwent near-infrared spectroscopy scanning while performing top-down selective and divided attention DL tasks. Then, they undertook a speech task and completed a questionnaire to assess the degrees of their self-focused attention and external attention bias. The results showed that the degree of social fear and self-focused attention during the speech task were negatively correlated with scores on the selective attention task and with the activity of the left pars opercularis during the selective DL task, which were related to each other. These results suggest that a relationship exists between social fear, self-focused attention in a social situation, and top-down selective attentional dysfunction as assessed both behaviorally and by brain activity changes.

Adolescents' attention-seeking motives were examined as a mediator of these over-time associations. In line with this model's account of self-image failure, we also expected that narcissistic youth's attention-seeking should increase following experiences of ego threat, such as social rejection. These hypotheses were tested with two waves of self-report data, spaced one year apart, among 307 adolescents aged 12\\u201315 at T1 (Mage = 12.87, SD = 0.75). In line with predictions, earlier adolescent narcissism predicted later social media disclosure, problematic use, and smartphone stress, via increased attention-seeking. Furthermore, a significant interaction between narcissism and perceived social rejection at T1 predicted adolescents' outcomes at T2, via attention-seeking; Participants with a combination of higher narcissism and higher rejection at T1 reported higher levels of attention-seeking at T2. These longitudinal results suggest that narcissistic adolescents' attention-seeking on social media, particularly as a way to recover from social rejection, might backfire and ultimately contribute to an ongoing pattern of self-defeating behavior.

The role of social attention in associations between empathy and aggression has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, indicators of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, social attention, and aggression were simultaneously assessed in children aged 45 months. A total of 61 mother-child dyads participated in a lab visit, during which maternal reports of aggression were obtained. Children watched three clips showing a sad, scared, and happy child, respectively, and a neutral social clip while heart rate was recorded. Heart rate change from nonsocial baseline clips to emotional clips was calculated as an index of affective empathy. Questions about the emotions of the children in the clips were asked to assess cognitive empathy. Social attention was defined as time spent looking at faces during the clips. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between affective empathy and aggression and between social attention and aggression. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that the association between affective empathy and aggression was moderated by social attention; the negative association between affective empathy and aggression was stronger in children with relatively reduced social attention. No association was found between cognitive empathy and aggression. Therefore, both affective empathy and social attention are important targets for early interventions that aim to prevent or reduce aggression. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, no evidence of heritability or shared genetic effects was observed for the attentional effect directed by a non-social cue (i.e. arrow direction) and its correlation with the social attention ability. Remarkably, one's autistic traits could well predict his\\/her heritable core social attention ability extracted from the conventional social attentional effect. Conclusions These findings together suggest that human social attention ability is supported by unique genetic mechanisms that can be shared across different social, but not non-social, processing. Moreover, they also encourage the identification of \\u2018social attention genes\\u2019 and highlight the critical role of the core human social attention ability in seeking the endophenotypes of social cognitive disorders including ASD.

Multisensory and dynamic events have been shown to elicit more attention and produce greater sustained attention in infants than auditory or visual events alone. Such redundant and often temporally synchronous information guides selectivity and facilitates perception, learning, and memory of properties of events specified by redundancy. In addition, events involving faces or other social stimuli provide an extraordinary amount of redundant information that attracts and sustains attention. In the current study, 4- and 8-month-old infants were shown 2-min multimodal videos featuring social or nonsocial stimuli to determine the relative roles of synchrony and stimulus category in inducing attention. Behavioral measures included average looking time and peak look duration, and convergent measurement of heart rate (HR) allowed for the calculation of HR-defined phases of attention: Orienting (OR), sustained attention (SA), and attention termination (AT). The synchronous condition produced an earlier onset of SA (less time in OR) and a deeper state of SA than the asynchronous condition. Social stimuli attracted and held attention (longer duration of peak looks and lower HR than nonsocial stimuli). Effects of synchrony and the social nature of stimuli were additive, suggesting independence of their influence on attention. These findings are the first to demonstrate different HR-defined phases of attention as a function of intersensory redundancy, suggesting greater salience and deeper processing of naturalistic synchronous audiovisual events compared with asynchronous ones.

Early word learning emerges in the context of tightly coupled social interactions between the early learner and a mature partner. In the present study, we develop and apply a novel paradigm-dual head-mounted eye tracking-to record momentary gaze data from both parents and infants during free-flowing toy-play contexts. With fine-grained sequential patterns extracted from continuous gaze streams, we objectively measure both joint attention and sustained attention as parents and 9-month-old infants played with objects and as parents named objects during play. We show that both joint attention and infant sustained attention predicted vocabulary sizes at 12 and 15 months, but infant sustained attention in the context of joint attention, not joint attention itself, is the stronger unique predictor of later vocabulary size. Joint attention may predict word learning because joint attention supports infant attention to the named object.

This empirical study explores the amount of attention tourists pay to social responsibility (environment and community) information when booking accommodation online.

The role of social attention in associations between empathy and aggression has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, indicators of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, social attention, and aggression were simultaneously assessed in children aged 45 months. A total of 61 mother\\u2013child dyads participated in a lab visit, during which maternal reports of aggression were obtained. Children watched three clips showing a sad, scared, and happy child, respectively, and a neutral social clip while heart rate was recorded. Heart rate change from nonsocial baseline clips to emotional clips was calculated as an index of affective empathy. Questions about the emotions of the children in the clips were asked to assess cognitive empathy. Social attention was defined as time spent looking at faces during the clips. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between affective empathy and aggression and between social attention and aggression. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that the association between affective empathy and aggression was moderated by social attention; the negative association between affective empathy and aggression was stronger in children with relatively reduced social attention. No association was found between cognitive empathy and aggression. Therefore, both affective empathy and social attention are important targets for early interventions that aim to prevent or reduce aggression.   Noten, M.M.P.G.; Van der Heijden, K.

These networks can be modulated by different contextual and relational situations. Aim of this review is to explain how a combination of natural and social stimuli can positively affect the attentional processes. It has been proposed that the exposition to natural environment can positively affect direct attention, a common resource supporting both executive functioning and self-regulation processes in cognition. It has been suggested that the decrease of the effort required to voluntary control attention from the bottom upwards could determine some internal reflection that may support creative thinking secondarily to a simultaneous reduction in the effort required to orient attention between thoughts and impressions. In my view, not only exposition to natural and green environment improves attentional processes but also the involvement in social relationship. The development of the orientation and inhibitory control networks is sensitive to the social nature of the stimuli, for instance, in a task, including socially relevant stimuli the efficiency of these two attentional networks increases in children, in adults and in elderly subjects. Social attention, starting very early in the life (joint attention) is a very important mechanism for the regulation of social relationships. A key for a better development of cognitive functions such as attentional processes is the promotion of the immersion in the natural environment and the involvement in social relationship. natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships  Federico, Francesca\"},{\"id\":\"32f558e65b0a59b654000bc7b2c0488148159fe17c7f9e4edb65ec52130262ec\",\"content\":\"A new look at joint attention and common knowledge Everyone agrees that joint attention is a key feature of human social cognition. Yet, despite over 40 years of work and hundreds of publications on this topic, there is still surprisingly little agreement on what exactly joint attention is, and how the jointness in it is achieved. Part of the problem, we propose, is that joint attention is not a single process, but rather it includes a cluster of different cognitive skills and processes, and different researchers focus on different aspects of it. A similar problem applies to common knowledge. Here we present a new approach: We outline a typology of social attention levels which are currently all referred to in the literature as joint attention (from monitoring to common, mutual, and shared attention), along with corresponding levels of common knowledge. We consider cognitive, behavioral, and phenomenological aspects of the different levels as well as their different functions, and a key distinction we make in all of this is second-personal vs. third-personal relations. While we focus mainly on joint attention and common knowledge, we also briefly discuss how these levels might apply to other \\u2018joint\\u2019 mental states such as joint goals.

The concept of directed social learning predicts that social learning opportunities for an individual will depend on social dynamics, context and demonstrator identity. However, few empirical studies have examined social attention biases in animal groups. Sex-based and kinship-based biases in social learning and social attention towards females have been shown in a despotic and female philopatric primate: the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The present study examined social attention during the juvenile period. Social attention was recorded through 5-min focal observations during periods of natural foraging. Kin emerged as the most important focus of social attention in juveniles, intensified by biased spatial proximity towards matrilineal related members. The highest-ranking conspecifics were more frequently observed by juveniles than low-ranking ones. Additionally, younger and orphaned juveniles showed higher levels of social attention overall, compared to other age categories. No effect of the juvenile's hierarchical rank was detected, suggesting that the variation in social attention recorded reflects different biases and stages of social learning and socialisation, rather than social anxiety. Juvenile females tended to exhibit a dominance-based bias more strongly than did males. This might be explained by a greater emphasis on attaining social knowledge during juvenile socialisation in the philopatric sex. Moreover, despite a preferred association between juveniles, social attention was more often directed to adults, suggesting that adults may still be more often chosen as a target of attention independent of their dominance rank.

However, individuals differ with respect to eye gaze behaviors such as frequency of eye-to-eye contacts, and these variations may reflect underlying differences in social behavior in the population. While the use of eye signaling to indicate a shared object of attention in joint attention tasks has been well-studied, the effects of the natural variation in establishing eye contact during joint attention have not been isolated. Here, we investigate this question using a novel two-person joint attention task. Participants were not instructed regarding the use of eye contacts; thus all mutual eye contact events between interacting partners that occurred during the joint attention task were spontaneous and varied with respect to frequency. We predicted that joint attention systems would be modulated by differences in the social behavior across participant pairs, which could be measured by the frequency of eye contact behavior. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and eye-tracking to measure the neural signals associated with joint attention in interacting dyads and to record the number of eye contact events between them. Participants engaged in a social joint attention task in which real partners used eye gaze to direct each other\\u2019s attention to specific targets. Findings were compared to a non-social joint attention task in which an LED cue directed both partners\\u2019 attention to the same target. The social joint attention condition showed greater activity in right temporoparietal junction than the non-social condition, replicating prior joint attention results. Eye-contact frequency modulated the joint attention activity, revealing bilateral activity in social and high level visual areas associated with partners who made more eye contact. Additionally, when the number of mutual eye contact events was used to classify each pair as either \\u201chigh eye contact\\u201d or \\u201clow eye contact\\u201d dyads, cross-brain coherence analysis revealed greater coherence between high eye contact dyads than low eye contact dyads in these same areas.

Disruption in this early neurobehavioral process may decrease the frequency and quality of social interactions and learning opportunities, potentially leading to downstream deleterious effects on social development. This study examined early attention in infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are at risk for social and communication delays. Visual and auditory attention was mapped from age 1 week to 5 months in infants at familial risk for ASD (high risk; N = 41) and low-risk typically developing infants (low risk; N = 39). At 12 months, a subset of participants ( N = 40) was administered assessments of social communication and nonverbal cognitive skills. Results revealed that high-risk infants performed lower on attention tasks at 2 and 3 months of age compared to low-risk infants. A significant association between overall attention at 3 months and developmental outcome at 12 months was observed for both groups. These results provide evidence for early vulnerabilities in visual attention for infants at risk for ASD during a period of important neurodevelopmental transition (between 2 and 3 months) when attention has significant implications for social communication and cognitive development.

It is shown that the ability to establish joint attention based on the direction of the interlocutor's gaze is a precursor of the emergence of social and cognitive abilities. The study examined the differences between typical developmental children and atypical development control groups in their ability to be sensitive to social behavioral signals, namely the orientation direction of the interlocutor's gaze. On a sample of 120 children with typical development, mental retardation, hearing impairment, speech disorders and visual impairment, a number of tasks were developed to assess the ability to use the character's direction of sight in the picture to determine its intentions. The task measured such a skill of joint attention as the child\\u2019s ability to calculate and report what the other person was looking at and what he intended to choose. We also used tasks with a central hint with an explicit indication of an arrow and a peripheral hint to check the recognition of social and non-social orienting signals.

In contrast, human infants displayed a non-linear pattern of social interest, with initially greater attention to the social stimulus, followed by a period of greater interest in the nonsocial stimulus, and then a rise in social interest from 6 to 13 months. Overall, human infants looked longer than macaque infants, suggesting humans have more sustained attention in the first year of life.

In order to measure the variables of the research, Stroop task, continuous performance test, Wisconsin Card Sorting test, and divided attention test were used. Attention training was presented on the experimental group in 8 sessions, using a set of related cognitive games and attention-based task .For data analysis, covariance analysis was used. Results The results indicated that attention training significantly increased the sustained attention performance and response inhibition of children with ADHD, but there was no significant effect on the selective attention function, shifting attention and divided attention. Conclusion According to the findings, the present training package can be used to improve sustained attention and response inhibition in children with ADHD. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; attention; cognition; Medicine; R; Medicine (General); R5-920 Majallah-i D\\u0101nishkadah-i \\u0312ul\\u016bm-i Pizishk\\u012b-i Niysh\\u0101b\\u016br, Vol 7, Iss 4, Pp 89-103 (2019) Nahid Nikpour; S.

Previous research has suggested that when a social partner, such as a parent, pays attention to an object, this increases the attention that infants pay to that object during spontaneous, naturalistic play. There are two contrasting reasons why this might be: first, social context may influence increases in infants\\u2019 endogenous (voluntary) attention control; second, social settings may offer increased opportunities for exogenous attentional capture. To differentiate these possibilities, we compared 12-month-old infants\\u2019 naturalistic attention patterns in two settings: Solo Play and Joint Play with a social partner (the parent). Consistent with previous research we found that infants\\u2019 look durations toward play objects were longer during Joint Play, and that moments of inattentiveness were fewer, and shorter. Follow-up analyses, conducted to differentiate the two above-proposed hypotheses, were more consistent with the latter hypothesis. We found that infants\\u2019 rate of change of attentiveness was faster during Joint Play than Solo Play, suggesting that internal attention factors, such as attentional inertia, may influence looking behaviour less during Joint Play. We also found that adults\\u2019 attention forwards-predicted infants\\u2019 subsequent attention more than vice versa, suggesting that adults\\u2019 behaviour may drive infants\\u2019 behaviour. Finally, we found that mutual gaze did not directly facilitate infant attentiveness. Overall, our results suggest that infants spend more time attending to objects during Joint Play than Solo Play, but that these differences are more likely attributable to increased exogenous attentional scaffolding from the parent during social play, rather than to increased endogenous attention control from the infant.

The present review draws together studies that have measured the orienting of attention, following observation of another\\u2019s goal-directed action. Our review proposes that, in line with the literature on eye gaze, action is a particularly strong orienting cue for the visual system. However, we additionally suggest that action may orient visual attention using mechanisms, which gaze direction does not (i.e., neural direct mapping and corepresentation). Finally, we review the implications of these gaze-independent mechanisms for the study of attention to action. We suggest that our understanding of attention to action may benefit from being studied in the context of joint action paradigms, where the role of higher level action goals and social factors can be investigated.

This study aimed to know the correlation of emotion regulation and parental attention to social problem solving of boarding school adolescents. The research subjects were 65 students of SMAN CMBBS who were selected by simple random sampling method. The instruments used are social problem-solving scale, emotion regulation scale, and parental attention scale. Data were analyzed by multiple regression analysis. The results showed that there was a significant correlation between emotion regulation and parental attention with social problem solving for SMAN CMBBS adolescents, with p = 0.00 (R = 0.699). Partial correlation test proves that there is a significant correlation between emotional regulation and social problem solving for SMAN CMBBS adolescents (p = 0.00; rx1y = 0.549). Partial correlation also proves that there is a significant relationship of parental attention to social problem solving for adolescent CMBBS (p = 0.032; rx2y = 0.268). This study concludes that there is a significant correlation between emotion regulation and parental attention to social problem solving of SMAN CMBBS adolescents.

Attention bias modification (ABM) is a potential intervention in relieving social anxiety symptoms, while its underlying neural mechanisms are not yet understood. The current study included 63 college students with social anxiety. Participants were assigned to the attention modification program (AMP, n = 20), the attention control condition (ACC, n = 20) and the passive waiting group (PW, n = 23). Questionnaires and the emotional Stroop task with EEG recordings were used to assess whether and how the 4-week ABM period affected emotional symptoms and specific emotional processing. Results showed that the two training groups (AMP and ACC) produced comparable emotional improvements and both showed a decrease in negative bias compared with the PW group. The ERP results indicated that despite no significant ERP changes in the PW group, the ACC group exhibited a greater N1, whereas the AMP group exhibited a reduced VPP at the post-test stage compared to the pre-test stage. Besides, both training groups showed a similar late positive potential (LPP) reduction. Notably, the reduction in LPP was positively correlated with behavioral and symptom improvement. Thus, manipulations unique to ABM (face-target contingency) primarily modulate the early attention distribution of material-related stimuli. However, the clinical benefits of attention training may be due to later cognitive-affective mechanisms.

Typically, this bias has been conceptualized as driven by an overactive bottom-up attentional system; however, this potentially overlooks the role of top-down attention in being able to modulate this bottom-up bias. Here, the role of top-down mechanisms in directing attention toward emotional faces was assessed with a modified dot-probe task, in which participants were given a top-down cue (\\\"happy\\\" or \\\"angry\\\") to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial, and the cued face was either presented with a face of the other emotion (angry, happy) or a neutral face. This study found that social anxiety was not associated with differences in shifting attention toward cued angry faces. However, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were selectively impaired in attentional shifting toward a cued happy face when it was paired with an angry face, but not when paired with a neutral face. The results indicate that top-down attention can be used to orient attention to emotional faces, but that higher levels of social anxiety are associated with selective deficits in top-down control of attention in the presence of threat.

Altered emotion-attention interactions have been associated with symptoms of affective disturbances, and emerging research focuses on improving emotion-attention interactions to prevent or treat affective disorders. In line with the Human Affectome Project's emphasis on linguistic components, we also analyzed the language used to describe attention-related aspects of emotion, and highlighted terms related to domains such as conscious awareness, motivational effects of attention, social attention, and emotion regulation.

This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other\\u2019s mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.

Studies of joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder employ a variety of instrumentation, environments and occupations. From the occupational therapy perspective, current literature lacks a rigorous analysis of the transactions of person, environment and occupation embedded within the procedures of these studies. The goal of this scoping review was to investigate how these components transact to affect occupational performance. Method Using the Person\\u2013Environment\\u2013Occupation model as an evaluative lens, a scoping review was completed to summarize person, environment and occupation transactions in studies examining joint attention in children aged 6\\u201312 years with autism spectrum disorder. Results Six studies were included. Findings indicated that simplified social environments and demonstrations of joint attention promoted higher joint attention performance in children with autism spectrum disorder, at the cost of ecological validity. Maintaining ecological validity in complex social environments resulted in lower joint attention performance. Conclusion The Person\\u2013Environment\\u2013Occupation model can be used to develop an occupational therapy perspective on literature from outside the discipline.

Loneliness is a motivational factor for building and maintaining social connections. Automatic attention occurs with little cognitive effort and plays a key role in detecting biologically salient events, such as human faces. Although previous studies have investigated the effect of loneliness on social behavior, the effect of loneliness on automatic attention to human faces remains largely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of loneliness on automatic visual attention to warmth and competence facial information, which determines facial attraction. This study included 43 participants who rated warmth and competence facial information. Then, they engaged with the target-distractor paradigm in which they saw two house images at the top and bottom and indicated whether the images were identical. During the task, we presented two faces as distractors and measured visual attention toward the faces as automatic attention because participants did not have to attend to the faces. The results showed an interactive effect between subjective loneliness and facial information on automatic attention. Warm targets automatically captured the attention of people feeling relatively lonely, whereas competent targets automatically captured the attention of those who felt less lonely. These results suggest that loneliness adaptively influences automatic processing of social information. automatic attention; competence; loneliness; social cognition; warmth; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 10 (2020) Toshiki Saito; Kosuke Motoki; Rui Nouchi; Ryuta Kawashima; Motoaki Sugiura\"},{\"id\":\"0ec13e43b44edb66ec98c749db09f35dbf192d314ceee589c5f7deeaddf9cf2d\",\"content\":\"Human body motion captures visual attention and elicits pupillary dilation The social motivation theory proposes that individuals naturally orient their attention to the social world.

Adult learners often rely on a situational context to learn and understand a new word's meaning. Here, we explored whether interactive learning facilitates word learning by directing the learner's attention to a correct new word referent when a situational context is non-informative. We predicted larger involvement of inferior parietal, frontal, and visual cortices involved in visuo-spatial attention during interactive learning. We scanned participants while they played a visual word learning game with and without a social partner. As hypothesized, interactive learning enhanced activity in the right Supramarginal Gyrus when the situational context provided little information. Activity in the right Inferior Frontal Gyrus during interactive learning correlated with post-scanning behavioral test scores, while these scores correlated with activity in the Fusiform Gyrus in the non-interactive group. These results indicate that attention is involved in interactive learning when the situational context is minimal and suggest that individual learning processes may be largely different from interactive ones. As such, they challenge the ecological validity of what we know about individual learning and advocate the exploration of interactive learning in naturalistic settings.

Fifty-two young, intelligent adults with ASD (IQrange = 88\\u2013130, Agerange = 18\\u201324) and 31 typically developing (TD) ASD (IQrange = 94\\u2013139, Agerange = 19\\u201328) gender matched controls participated and reported on severity of autism symptoms [Social Responsiveness Scale for Adults (SRS-A)].

Lower SCL during video clips was related to autism symptom severity across participants (r = \\u2212.29). ASD individuals reported lower emotional awareness.

IMPROVING VISUAL ATTENTION TO SOCIAL STIMULI IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA Abstract Background Social dysfunction is a hallmark characteristic of schizophrenia, and individuals with this disorder often report difficulty navigating daily social interactions. Perceptual deficits, such as faulty visual attention to important aspects of social stimuli (i.e., failing to look at the most relevant portions of a stimulus), may be one mechanism by which social deficits arise. Faulty modulation of specific neural regions such as the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), may underlie visual attention abnormalities, and may act as suitable targets for neurostimulation. The current study utilizes neurostimulation to experimentally manipulate specific neural networks and determine whether stimulation 1) improves visual attention, 2) improves performance on social cognitive tasks, and 3) whether altered visual attention moderates this improved performance. Methods Using a double-blind crossover design, participants underwent both active and sham stimulation via tDCS approximately one week apart. Half of the participants received active and sham stimulation of rTPJ (n = 22), while the other half received active and sham stimulation of a comparator site within the social brain network (dmPFC, n = 23). After stimulation, visual attention was assessed through concurrent eye-tracking while participants complete several tasks of social cognition (emotion recognition: ER40, BLERT; Theory of Mind: TASIT). Visual attention was determined as the proportion of time spent attending to socially and contextually important AOIs. Results Data collection and data processing are still ongoing for this study, however planned interim analyses on a subset of the total sample (n = 45) indicate small to medium effects of active stimulation to the rTPJ compared to sham and dmPFC stimulation for both visual attention (\\u03b7p2=.035) and social cognitive performance on the BLERT task (\\u03b7p2=.067), specifically. These same effects are not seen in the other social cognitive tasks. Final analyses based on a sample size of 72 individuals are expected to be complete prior to presentation at SIRS 2020. Discussion This study is the first, to our knowledge, to target this neural region within schizophrenia for the purposes of improving visual attention and, subsequently, social cognition. Should the pattern of results from our interim analyses hold after completion of data collection, results indicate that active stimulation to the rTPJ has a unique impact on dynamic emotional stimuli, improving visual attention and accuracy in emotion recognition, suggesting a primary role of the rTPJ and visual attention in performance on this task. The intricate design of this study allows for thorough investigation of potential mechanisms by which social cognitive deficits develop, and the use of novel experimental techniques align with the theme of this year\\u2019s conference.

VIRTUAL REALITY SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING IMPROVES SOCIAL ATTENTION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA Abstract Background Social impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia presenting a major barrier to recovery. Although antipsychotic medications can reduce psychotic symptoms, social impairments often persist, contributing to poor outcome. Validated interventions, such as Social Skills Training (Bellack et al., 2004), target a broad range of social domains but they yield only modest effect sizes for social outcome (Pfammatter et al, 2006). Moreover, conventional social interventions suffer from high burden on the clients and therapists, low adherence, lack of personalization, and low generalizability. Importantly, social interventions are not widely available. Virtual reality (VR) offers a viable alternative to conventional therapies with several advantages including high acceptability, an extensive repertoire of stimuli, low-burden, low-cost and safety (Strickland, 1997). Importantly, VR allows for a precise targeting of social cognitive mechanisms. Social attention, the fast orientation and allocation of resources to social stimuli can be indexed by tracking eye movements. Abnormal eye scanning behavior during social interactions has been linked to poor social functioning in schizophrenia (Brunet-Gouet & Decety, 2006). We designed a VR-based social skills training game to directly target social attention in schizophrenia. Methods Eighteen individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) participated in the VR training game twice a week for 5 weeks. Eye movement patterns were recorded throughout the training. Subjects were required to solve social \\u201cmissions\\u201d (e.g., obtain personal information through conversations with avatars) in different naturalistic scenarios. To start a mission, participants had to fixate on the chosen avatar. The latency to engage in a social interaction was indexed by the fixation time (social engagement latency). Each session consisted of 12 missions. We compared social engagement latency and eye gaze patterns pre- and post-training to assess the efficacy of the VR social skills training program. Results Social engagement latency significantly decreased after 10 sessions (d=0.78). This result suggests that prosocial attention benefitted from VR training. We also found that the standard deviation of dwell time (i.e., proportion of time spent looking at the avatar\\u2019s face during a conversation) significantly increased across training sessions (d=0.56). This result suggests an increased modulation of interpersonal engagement during social interaction. Additionally, participants\\u2019 emotion recognition ability significantly increased (\\u03b72 = 0.27), and negative symptoms significantly decreased (\\u03b72=0.34) from pre- to post- training. Importantly, these changes in social attention correlated with improvement in negative symptoms. Discussion Simulated and targeted social interactions with avatars in VR significantly improved social attention in individuals with schizophrenia. Importantly, improvements in negative symptoms and emotion perception after training suggest that this training protocol has an impact on a broad range of social functions. VR training is a promising alternative to traditional psychosocial interventions to target specific mechanisms underlying social functioning in schizophrenia.

These networks can be modulated by different contextual and relational situations. Aim of this review is to explain how a combination of natural and social stimuli can positively affect the attentional processes. It has been proposed that the exposition to natural environment can positively affect direct attention, a common resource supporting both executive functioning and self-regulation processes in cognition. It has been suggested that the decrease of the effort required to voluntary control attention from the bottom upwards could determine some internal reflection that may support creative thinking secondarily to a simultaneous reduction in the effort required to orient attention between thoughts and impressions. In my view, not only exposition to natural and green environment improves attentional processes but also the involvement in social relationship. The development of the orientation and inhibitory control networks is sensitive to the social nature of the stimuli, for instance, in a task, including socially relevant stimuli the efficiency of these two attentional networks increases in children, in adults and in elderly subjects. Social attention, starting very early in the life (joint attention) is a very important mechanism for the regulation of social relationships. A key for a better development of cognitive functions such as attentional processes is the promotion of the immersion in the natural environment and the involvement in social relationship. natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Francesca Federico\"},{\"id\":\"3ed614e640187494e80ec2b8c769d8cabb7faafedd9f81294aa64852baa08053\",\"content\":\"Neural correlates of negative expectancy and impaired social feedback processing in social anxiety Social anxiety has been associated with abnormalities in cognitive processing in the literature, manifesting as various cognitive biases.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) in these two stages were recorded to detect the effect of social anxiety that might not be reflected by behavioral data. Participants were divided into two groups according to their social anxiety level. Participants in the high social anxiety (HSA) group were more likely to predict that they would be socially rejected by peers than did their low social anxiety (LSA) counterparts (i.e. the control group). Compared to the ERP data of the LSA group, the HSA group showed: (a) a larger P1 component to social cues (peer faces) prior to social feedback presentation, possibly indicating an attention bias; (b) a difference in feedback-related negativity amplitude between unexpected social acceptance and unexpected social rejection, possibly indicating an expectancy bias; and (c) a diminished sensitivity of the P3 amplitude to social feedback valence (be accepted\\/be rejected), possibly indicating an experience bias.

An Eye Tracking Analysis BackgroundVisual atypicalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are a well documented phenomenon, beginning as early as 2\\u20136 months of age and manifesting in a significantly decreased attention to the eyes, direct gaze and socially salient information. Early emerging neurobiological deficits in perceiving social stimuli as rewarding or its active avoidance due to the anxiety it entails have been widely purported as potential reasons for this atypicality. Parallel research evidence also points to the significant benefits of animal presence for reducing social anxiety and enhancing social interaction in children with autism. While atypicality in social attention in ASD has been widely substantiated, whether this atypicality persists equally across species types or is confined to humans has not been a key focus of research insofar.MethodsWe attempted a comprehensive examination of the differences in visual attention to static images of human and animal faces (40 images; 20 human faces and 20 animal faces) among children with ASD using an eye tracking paradigm. 44 children (ASD n = 21; TD n = 23) participated in the study (10,362 valid observations) across five regions of interest (left eye, right eye, eye region, face and screen).ResultsResults obtained revealed significantly greater social attention across human and animal stimuli in typical controls when compared to children with ASD. However in children with ASD, a significantly greater attention allocation was seen to animal faces and eye region and lesser attention to the animal mouth when compared to human faces, indicative of a clear attentional preference to socially salient regions of animal stimuli. The positive attentional bias toward animals was also seen in terms of a significantly greater visual attention to direct gaze in animal images.ConclusionOur results suggest the possibility that atypicalities in social attention in ASD may not be uniform across species. It adds to the current neural and biomarker evidence base of the potentially greater social reward processing and lesser social anxiety underlying animal stimuli as compared to human stimuli in children with ASD. animals; autism (ASD); social attention; visual attention; eye tracking; human animal interaction (HAI); Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Georgitta J.

Six-to-ten year-old children and young adults took part in the current study, employing a combination of behavioural and eye-tracking measures. Social stimuli in naturalistic scenes distracted both children and adults during visual search, as demonstrated by their gaze behavior and search times. In addition, eye-tracking revealed even greater attentional capture by social distractors for children. Memory for targets was worse in social compared to non-social scenes. Intriguingly, children demonstrated overall better memory precision than adults. Finally, when participants detected previously learnt targets within visual scenes, adults were slower for targets appearing at unexpected (invalid) locations within social scenes compared to non-social scenes, but this was not the case for children. In their entirety, these findings suggest that the interplay between social attentional biases, memory and memory-guided attention is complex and modulated by age-related differences.

Investigators have found that there is a continuum of autism-like traits in the general population, suggesting that these autistic traits may be examined in the absence of clinically diagnosed autism. To provide evidence for the continuum of autistic traits in terms of social attention and to provide insights into social attention deficits in people with autism, the current study was conducted to examine the effect of autistic traits of typically developing individuals on social orienting using a spatial cueing paradigm. The typically developing individuals who participated in this study were divided into high autistic traits (HA) and low autistic traits groups using the Autism Quotient scale. All participants completed a spatial cueing task in which social cues (gaze) and non-social cues (arrow) were presented under different cue predictability conditions (predictive vs. non-predictive) with different SOAs (100 ms vs. 400 ms). The results showed that compared to low autistic individuals, high autistic individuals had less benefit from non-predictive social cues but greater benefit from non-social ones, providing evidence that such spatial attention impairment in high autistic individuals is specific to the social domain. Interestingly, the smaller benefit from non-predictive social cues in high autistic individuals was shown only in the 400 ms condition, not in the 100 ms condition, suggesting that their difficulties in orienting to non-predictive social cues may be caused by a deficiency in spontaneously effortful control processing. autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits; attention orienting; social cues; non-social cues; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Guoyao Lin; Yanling Cui; Jiajing Zeng; Liang Huang\"},{\"id\":\"529bb490986703ae4009d59848ce402280d76198fc631be87fdd155af6a98845\",\"content\":\"A new look at joint attention and common knowledge Everyone agrees that joint attention is a key feature of human social cognition. Yet, despite over 40 years of work and hundreds of publications on this topic, there is still surprisingly little agreement on what exactly joint attention is, and how the jointness in it is achieved. Part of the problem, we propose, is that joint attention is not a single process, but rather it includes a cluster of different cognitive skills and processes, and different researchers focus on different aspects of it. A similar problem applies to common knowledge. Here we present a new approach: We outline a typology of social attention levels which are currently all referred to in the literature as joint attention (from monitoring to common, mutual, and shared attention), along with corresponding levels of common knowledge. We consider cognitive, behavioral, and phenomenological aspects of the different levels as well as their different functions, and a key distinction we make in all of this is second-personal vs. third-personal relations.

While this literature demonstrates the influence of facial attractiveness on overt attention, how facial attractiveness drives covert attention is less known. In two studies, we tracked eye and hand movements while participants were engaged in a numerical task in the presence of faces of various degrees of attractiveness. Results show that both attractive and unattractive faces captured greater visual attention compared to moderate faces, whereas attractive faces attracted hand movement more strongly than both unattractive and moderate faces.

What is less well known, however, is whether such attentional capture also occurs in a wider social context, such as when observing people in pain. In order to explore this possibility, we adopted a novel social-cue detection methodology: the bodies-in-the-crowd task. Two experiments are reported that consider whether nonverbal cues of pain, happiness and anger as expressed through body postures would capture and hold attention. Both experiments recruited 40 (20 male, 20 female) pain-free individuals. Overall, results show that pain postures do not capture attention any more than happiness or anger postures, but disengagement from pain postures was significantly slower across both studies. Gender differences were also found, and were more likely to be found, when crowds comprised both men and women. Male pain postures were more likely to capture attention.

Male observers showed no variation based on target or distractor gender. Implications and potential directions for future research are discussed.

However, human attention is a limited resource and it is increasingly challenging to consume the most suitable content for one\\u2019s interests. In fact, the complex interplay between individual and social activities in social systems overwhelmed by information results in bursty activity of collective attention which are still poorly understood. Here, we tackle this challenge by analyzing the online activity of millions of users in a popular microblogging platform during exceptional events, from NBA Finals to the elections of Pope Francis and the discovery of gravitational waves. We observe extreme fluctuations in collective attention that we are able to characterize and explain by considering the co-occurrence of two fundamental factors: the heterogeneity of social interactions and the preferential attention towards influential users. Our findings demonstrate how combining simple mechanisms provides a route towards understanding complex social phenomena.

With so much emphasis on economic and financial return, governments and commercial businesses often neglect or provide insufficient attention towards the social and natural environments. This recent surge in non-profit and social activity from social entrepreneurs is proving to be an effective means of doing business, stirring up much controversy amongst scholars along the way. This paper dives into the hotly debated definition of social entrepreneurship and examines the types of opportunities and challenges associated with new phenomenon. Then, the report concludes with a discussion on the complexity of social entrepreneurship and why future research is needed.

Delay aversion as a motivational style is characterised by a negative emotional reaction to the burden of delay. Children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder have a stronger need to seek smaller immediate rewards rather than larger delayed rewards. This study ascertains whether children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder have different responses when asked to choose between a larger delayed reward and a smaller immediate reward. Furthermore, it determines whether there are differences in response among the attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder presentations. A sample ( N = 188) of attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder participants ( n = 94) was compared with that of a group of children ( n = 94) without attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder. These children attended primary school in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The Two-Choice Impulsivity Paradigm computer task was administered. The results showed that children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder\\u2013combined presentation selected significantly smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards in comparison to the control group, whereas children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder\\u2013predominantly inattentive and attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder\\u2013hyperactive\\/impulsive presentations did not demonstrate a significant difference in choice compared to the control group. In addition, no effect for gender was found. Children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder seem to present with impulsive responses, which lead them to complete the concerned task faster and thereby escape delay. The study confirmed that children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder\\u2013combined presentation may face problems with waiting for delayed rewards, which could have negative consequences in social and academic situations.

And also how top-down attention and awareness have opposing functions. Methodology: This article is a systematic review of the relationship between visual attention and awareness. An extensive elaborate study on concepts relating to attention and consciousness dissociation has been done. In this article we also narrow it down to experimental design that requires independent manipulation of each. Which include top-down attention and awareness aspect of consciousness? Main Findings: Many researches have been put forward supporting the independent nature of attention from awareness using sophisticated experimental and physiological shreds of evidence. On the other hand, some researches still stick to the contemporary common-sense notion of no awareness no attention. Our evaluation suggests an independent nature of attention and awareness. Application: This article intends to give a clear perspective of the ongoing debate on the relationship between attention and consciousness. Simplification of both umbrella terms will give basis for building more empirical evidence. Novelty: Further, this article put forward studies on both sides of debate aiming to bridge the gap to get a conclusive outlook in the future. awareness; attention; dissociation; top-down attention; cognitive debate Humanities & Social Sciences Reviews; Vol. 7 No. 5 (2019): September; 516-521 ; 2395-6518 Agarwal, Aarushi; Patel, Ajeet; Singh, Tara; Tiwari, Trayambak; Lata Singh, Anju\"},{\"id\":\"eaceea3b9a7ed5fd90c8d8eb635d07f5b1df3457f7c07da4796c2289d29a3bd6\",\"content\":\"Distraction Modulates Self-Referential Effects in the Processing of Monetary and Social Rewards A reward that is personally relevant tends to induce stronger pursuit motivation than a reward that is linked to other people. However, the role of attention in eliciting this \\u201cself-referential reward effect\\u201d remains unclear. In our two studies, we evaluated the significance of attention in self-referential reward processing utilizing an ownership paradigm, which required participants to complete a visual search task to win either monetary rewards (in Study 1) or social rewards (in Study 2) for themselves or for an acquaintance. Access to attentional resources was manipulated by sometimes including a distracting stimulus among the presented stimuli. The results of Study 1 revealed that a significant self-referential reward effect emerged under undistracted attentional conditions and was associated with improved task performance when self-owned monetary rewards were available. However, distracted attention impaired this self-referential reward effect. Moreover, distracted attention was also observed in the self-referential social reward processing in Study 2. These results suggested that distracted attention can impair the pursuit advantage for self-relevant rewards; self-referential processing is strongly dependent on attentional resources. self-relevance; attention; social reward; monetary reward; ownership; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 9 (2019) Jia Zhu; Youlong Zhan\"},{\"id\":\"be9bb49fb7ac765d907f23f596e5fff50abf2a157b17d215fd4bdc56b592dde9\",\"content\":\"Attention to social stimuli is modulated by sex and exposure time in tufted capuchin monkeys The dot-probe task is an experimental procedure commonly used to study how animals (including humans) pay attention to different stimuli.

Subjects were shown pairs of images of unfamiliar conspecifics: a male vs. a female or two individuals grooming vs. two individuals not engaged in grooming. With shorter image exposures (250 ms) both sexes responded faster to (i.e., biased their attention towards) images of unfamiliar males compared to females, and were unaffected by images of grooming compared to nongrooming. With longer image exposures (1000 ms) females biased their attention towards images of unfamiliar females, while males did not show any difference; in contrast, males biased their attention towards images of grooming compared to nongrooming, while females did not show any difference. We interpret these results as showing that responses to the dot-probe task with different image exposures reflect different attentional phenomena, and that the two sexes differ in how social stimuli affect their attention.

We adapted a computerized process-based training targeting these attention mechanisms through mouse-based contingency responses and examined its effects on reappraisal and rumination. Forty-one participants were randomly assigned to either a control or an active training condition of mouse-based contingent attention training (MCAT). Participants in the active condition were instructed to allocate attention toward positive words to generate positive interpretations, by using attention regulation while receiving contingent feedback on their attention to emotional words. Participants in the control condition freely generated interpretations without receiving contingent feedback. Transfer to reappraisal and state rumination was evaluated by administering an emotion regulation paradigm before and after the training. Mouse-based attention estimations showed a high degree of congruency with real eye\\/gaze-based attention estimations, as measured with eye-tracking performed in parallel. Furthermore, active MCAT resulted in several beneficial effects, including: 1) a higher attention toward positive over negative information; 2) an improved reappraisal ability to down-regulate negative emotions, and 3) a larger state rumination reduction in comparison to the control group. Our findings supports MCAT as a promising way to monitor and train attention, being an innovative instrument for online interventions aimed to improve stress regulation and resilience.

This paper complements theoretical and methodological considerations regarding social media in critical discourse studies as it addresses social media content policies as a key contextual element. Specifically, this paper argues that - and why - the exploration of content policies and their enforcement is indispensable when approaching social media platforms and social media data in particular from a critical perspective. A number of researchers have already begun to identify contextual elements that require particular attention when viewing social media and social media data through a CDS lens. However, social media sites' content policies, as pervasive contextual element, have not received adequate research attention yet. Drawing on Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis (CMDA) and recent developments in Social Media CDS (SM-CDS), this paper first demonstrates the existing gap in research. Then, it contends that social media sites' content policies deserve more detailed attention in SM-CDS, argues why this is the case and elaborates on the different aspects of content policies and policy enforcement that require examination. After detailed theoretical discussion of this, empirical evidence to support this argument is presented in the form of a case study of Wikipedia and Wikipedia data. social media; CDS; SM-CDS; content policies; Wikipedia  Kopf, Susanne\"},{\"id\":\"30b58d89fffc50d969d887f31e59c0ce170fcc9d03c957774b8ca1a336c8f94b\",\"content\":\"Development of Virtual Reality Continuous Performance Test Utilizing Social Cues for Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit\\/Hyperactivity Disorder Virtual reality (VR) neuropsychological assessments have the potential for the ecological measurement of attention. We analyzed the newly developed VR continuous performance test (VR-CPT) for Korean children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC). To identify specific features of a virtual environment that influence the attention performance of children, we investigated whether the presence of a virtual teacher and social cues in the VR environment affects their attention performance. A total of 38 participants (18 TDC and 20 ADHD children and adolescents) were recruited for VR-CPT testing. Bivariate correlational analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the results of the VR-CPT and ADHD questionnaires to determine the capacity of VR-CPT to mirror real-life attention behaviors. Mixed-design analysis of variables was conducted to compare the effects of the social aspects of the VR-CPT on attention performance in groups. There were significant associations between ADHD rating scores and the omission error, commission error, reaction time (RT), reaction time variability (RTV), and total accuracy of the VR-CPT in the ADHD group. In addition, the ADHD group exhibited comparable performance with the TDC group for all measures of the VR-CPT. Also there seemed to be a trend of decreasing RTV when a virtual teacher with social cues was present compared with the equipment control condition in the ADHD group. Performance in the VR-CPT program was associated with behavioral measures of ADHD symptoms. Adding social aspects to a VR environment commonly encountered by children and adolescents has the potential to make a difference in the attention performance of youths with ADHD. ; restriction Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/classification; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/diagnosis; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/psychology; Child; Cues*; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests*; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality*; attention; continuous performance test; neuropsychological assessment; social cues; virtual reality  \"},{\"id\":\"9176644b8d1694d98546f207af455a3af50fa9de4be49f689d1afcf8be516c02\",\"content\":\"Attention to faces and gaze-following in social anxiety: preliminary evidence from a naturalistic eye-tracking investigation Social attentional biases are a core component of social anxiety disorder, but research has not yet determined their direction due to methodological limitations.

In both studies, the 2.5-year-olds who watched the film together approached more quickly than the other children.

A limitation of this literature is the lack of empirical work that has explicitly characterized how this relationship manifests itself over time. We investigate this issue by analysing data from two large eye-tracking datasets (total n = 176). Via growth-curve analysis, we demonstrate that self-reported empathy (as measured by the empathy quotient\\u2014EQ) predicts the temporal evolution of gaze behaviour under conditions where social and non-social stimuli compete for attention. In both datasets, we found that EQ not only predicted a global increase in social attention, but predicted a different temporal profile of social attention. Specifically, we detected a reliable effect of empathy on gaze towards social images after prolonged viewing. An analysis of switch latencies revealed that low-EQ observers switched gaze away from an initially fixated social image more frequently and at earlier latencies than high-EQ observers. Our analyses demonstrate that modelling these temporal components of gaze signals may reveal useful behavioural phenotypes. The explanatory power of this approach may provide enhanced biomarkers for conditions marked by deficits in empathy-related processes.

Orienting to facial expressions has typically been conceptualised as due to bottom-up attentional capture. However, this overlooks the contributions of top-down attention and selection history. In the present study, across four experiments, these three attentional processes were differentiated using a variation of the dot-probe task, in which participants were cued to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial. Results show that attention toward facial expressions was not exclusively driven by bottom-up attentional capture; instead, participants could shift their attention toward both happy and angry faces in a top-down manner. This effect was not found when the faces were inverted, indicating that top-down attention relies on holistic processing of the face. In addition, no evidence of selection history was found (i.e., no improvement on repeated trials or blocks of trials in which the task was to orient to the same expression). Altogether, these results suggest that humans can use top-down attentional control to rapidly orient attention to emotional faces.

Abstract Background The male bias in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses is well documented. As a result, less is known about the female ASD phenotype. Recent research suggests that conclusions drawn from predominantly male samples may not accurately capture female behavior. In this study, we explore potential sex differences in attention to social stimuli, which is generally reported to be diminished in ASD. Population-based sex differences in attention to faces have been reported, such that typically developing (TD) females attend more to social stimuli (including faces) from infancy through adulthood than TD males. It is yet unknown whether population-based sex differences in the face domain are preserved in ASD. Methods A dynamic, naturalistic infrared eye-tracking paradigm measured attention to social stimuli (faces) in 74 school-aged males and females with ASD (male N = 23; female N = 19) and without ASD (male N = 16; female N = 16). Two kinds of video stimuli were presented that varied in social content: rich social scenes (dyadic play between two children) and lean social scenes (parallel play by two children). Results Results revealed a significant 3-way interaction between sex, diagnosis, and condition after controlling for chronological and mental age. ASD females attended more to faces than ASD males in the socially lean condition. This effect was not found in the typically developing (TD) group. ASD males attended less to faces regardless of social context; however, ASD females only attended significantly less to faces compared to TD females in the socially rich condition. TD males and ASD females did not differ in their attention to faces in either condition. Conclusions This study has implications for how the field understands core social deficits in children with ASD, which should ideally be benchmarked against same-sex peers (male and female). Social attention in ASD females fell on a continuum\\u2014greater than their ASD male peers, but not as great as TD females. Overall, their social attention mirrored that of TD males. Improved understanding of the female social phenotype in ASD will enhance early screening and diagnostic efforts and will guide the development of sex-sensitive experimental paradigms and social interventions.

The objectives of the robot interaction sessions is to improve the academic capabilities of ASD patients by increasing the length and the quality of their attention. The system uses a NAO robot and an added mobile display to present emotional cues and solicit appropriate emotional responses. The interaction is semi-autonomous with minimal human intervention. Interaction occurs within an adaptive dynamic scenario composed of 13 sections. The scenario allows adaptive customization based on the attention score history of each patient. The attention score is autonomously generated by the system and depends on face attention and joint attention cues and sound responses. The scoring system allows us to prove that the customized interaction system increases the engagement and attention capabilities of ASD patients. After performing a pilot study, involving 6 ASD children, out of a total of 11 considered in the clinical setup, we conducted a long-term study. This study empirically proves that the proposed assessment system represents the attention state of the patient with 82.4% accuracy. 080602 - Computer-Human Interaction; autistic children; robots  Alnajjar, Fady; Cappuccio, Massimiliano; Renawi, Abdulrahman; Mubin, Omar (R17188); Loo, Chu Kiong\"},{\"id\":\"cfe43ce0b62d519ccdabde33376cd4fa6f0683080e4209b70f3c576b2efc459c\",\"content\":\"Using eye-tracking to understand the impact of multitasking on memory for banner ads : the role of attention to the ad International audience ; Media multitasking is on the rise due to the adoption of new technologies such as smartphones and tablets.

We present the analysis of attention skills in children with cognitive impairments over a series of child-robot interaction sessions. Here, an interaction consists of five different modules. The first module introduces the child to the robot. The next three modules are the task modules during which children are expected to improve their attention skills during the completion of a series of social tasks. The final module is a free style interaction, where the duration of interaction between the child and robot was used as a proxy to indicate the attention of the child towards a robot. Our analysis showed that the majority of the children reduced their task completion time in modules two to four, indicating an improvement in attention. Moreover, most of the children showed positive engagement towards the robot and spent an average of 120 s during the free style interaction in module five. The positive response suggests that the robot, via child-robot interaction could be a useful and engaging tool to improve attention skills of the children with cognitive impairment.

Research on oxytocin (OT) is currently drawing attention as an endocrine basis for social development. In this study, we investigated the relationship between visual attention to social cues and salivary OT levels in children exposed to CM. The results revealed that the CM group had a significantly lower percentage of gaze fixation for the human face eye area and lower salivary OT levels compared to the typical development group. Moreover, a path analysis suggested that gaze fixation for the eye area was a mediator of the relationship between salivary OT levels and social-emotional problems in the CM group. These results suggest that lower endogenous OT levels in maltreated children may lead to atypical development of their visual attention to eyes as a social cue, resulting in social-emotional problems.

In the single task, angry voices increased the occipital N2 component relative to neutral voices in women, but not men. In the dual task, angry voices relative to neutral voices increased occipital N1 and N2 components, as well as accuracy, in women and marginally decreased accuracy in men. Thus, in women, vocal anger produced a strong, multifaceted visual enhancement comprising attention-dependent and attention-independent processes, whereas in men, it produced a small, behavior-focused visual processing impairment that was strictly attention-dependent.

However, not all BI children develop anxiety. Attention bias (AB) may enhance the vulnerability for anxiety in BI children, and interfere with their development of effective emotion regulation. In order to fully probe attention patterns, we used traditional measures of reaction time (RT), stationary eye-tracking, and recently emerging mobile eye-tracking measures of attention in a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds characterized as BI ( N = 23) or non-BI ( N = 58) using parent reports. There were no BI-related differences in RT or stationary eye-tracking indices of AB in a dot-probe task. However, findings in a subsample from whom eye-tracking data were collected during a live social interaction indicated that BI children ( N = 12) directed fewer gaze shifts to the stranger than non-BI children ( N = 25). Moreover, the frequency of gazes toward the stranger was positively associated with stationary AB only in BI, but not in non-BI, children. Hence, BI was characterized by a consistent pattern of attention across stationary and ambulatory measures. We demonstrate the utility of mobile eye-tracking as an effective tool to extend the assessment of attention and regulation to social interactive contexts.

Consequently, efforts to better understand perfectionism have potential transdiagnostic impact. One mechanism proposed to underlie perfectionism is an attention bias towards information signalling threats to perfectionism whereby people with elevated perfectionism selectively attend to threatening stimuli. Method: The present study assessed whether two core dimensions of perfectionism, perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns, are characterised by a threat-related attention bias, and whether this bias was characterised by attention being more rapidly captured by the stimuli (engagement bias), or of greater difficulty to disengage attention (disengagement bias). Participants (N = 108) completed measures of perfectionistic strivings and concerns, and symptoms of psychological distress before completing a modified dot-probe task to measure attention biases. Attention bias index scores were calculated across three factors: engagement bias vs disengagement bias, perfectionism relevant vs irrelevant stimuli, and negative vs positive emotional stimuli. Results: Overall, perfectionistic concerns were associated with a disengagement bias for negative stimuli, regardless of whether stimuli were perfectionism relevant or not. No other significant main or interaction effects were observed. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional in design, and no temporal or causal inferences could be made. Additionally, participants were from a community sample and therefore replication is required in clinical populations. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that individuals higher in perfectionistic concerns experience difficulty withdrawing their attention from emotionally negative stimuli. These findings contribute new information to our theoretical understandings of perfectionism and provide support for the cognitive-behavioural model of perfectionism.

The roles of social power and satisfaction Purpose The success of social commerce depends on consumers' willingness to participate in social commerce activities. Practitioners have attached increasing attention to facilitating social commerce intention with influencer strategies. However, theoretical understanding or empirical investigation on the impact of digital influencers on consumers' social commerce intention is limited. This study aims to provide new insights into the drivers of two forms of social commerce intention: social shopping and social sharing intention. Based on the theoretical lens of social power, this study answers how digital influencers affect consumer satisfaction and ultimately boost their intention to conduct social commerce activities. Design\\/methodology\\/approach A field interview is conducted to determine the appropriate social power forms. An online survey on a large social commerce site in China with 310 respondents is conducted to test the proposed model. Findings Results indicate that expert power and referent power derived from digital influencers predict most of the consumers' economic satisfaction, whereas referent power and reciprocity power explain consumers' social satisfaction. Economic satisfaction affects social shopping and social sharing intention, whereas social satisfaction only influences social sharing intention. Originality\\/value This study sheds new light on the theoretical understanding of the effect of digital influencers through a lens of social power. It provides new insight into the determinants of social commerce intention. It also compensates for the neglect of social satisfaction in the social commerce context.

Infants' cognitive development and learning rely profoundly on their interactions with other people. In the first year, infants become increasingly sensitive to others' gaze and use it to focus their own attention on relevant visual input. However, infants are not passive observers in early social interactions, and these exchanges are characterized by high levels of contingency and reciprocity. Wass and colleagues offer first insights into the neurobehavioral dynamics of caregiver-infant interactions, demonstrating that caregivers' scalp-recorded theta band activity responds to their infant's changes in attention, and parental brain activation is associated with infants' sustenance of attention.

Does all this mean that the creativity of human attention has been merely displaced, from creatively paying attention to (a limited number of) things, to creatively devising algorithms that pay attention to (a higher number of) things? This perspective could be technologically attractive, if it weren't trapped within the constraints of neoliberal capitalism. Social-not technological-logics should be the main cause of our concern (and anxiety) about automation. Neoliberal capitalism tends to globally align the infinite diversity of our individual attentions under one single hegemonic imperative to maximize financial profit. This is both egocidal, as it automatizes our endo-attention subjected to segmented tasks that no longer make sense to us (pre-empting emancipatory forms of subjectification), and eco-cidal, as the race for short-term profit vandalizes our social and natural environments. We therefore need to sharpen our analyses (and anxieties), in order to deflect our fear of automation towards a rejection of neoliberal capitalism. Attention in Crisis? Our current discussions about a 'crisis of attention' are usually premised upon a number of supposedly self-evident truths, which deserve to be questioned, if not debunked.

This study aims to contribute to existing social media research by proposing and empirically testing a model in which social media brand involvement and social media brand communication are the main precursors and brand relationship quality is a relevant outcome of social media brand engagement. The findings show that the influence of social media brand involvement on social media brand engagement is stronger than the influence of social media brand communication. The latter is due to the co-creation of users and firms. Furthermore, interaction and attention are the most relevant components of social media brand engagement, followed by enthusiasm, identification, and absorption. Social media brand engagement is a useful tool for companies to gain competitive advantages. Thus, the findings could help firms better manage their social media tools in the context of social media communication.

Participants were six female children enrolled in public and private kindergartens and autism programs in Zulfi, Saudi Arabia for the second semester of the year 1435\\/1436 AH, who were diagnosed as having autism disorder. For data collection, Joint Attention Skills Inventory For Kindergarten Children with Autism Disorder, and Social Interaction Scale of Kindergarten Children with Autism Disorder were employed. A single group, pre-post and follow up design across participants was implemented. Six participants, data were obtained during pre, post-treatment, and at one-month follow-up. The study results showed that the pivotal response training intervention was effective in increasing joint attention skills (initiating and responding to signs, eye contact and follow the gaze of others, attract others' attention while playing, follow the instructions, Sharing feelings and emotional state and imitation) and social interaction (belonging to the group, communication, and cooperation) of all children participated in this study. Recommendations for further research were discussed.

Advocacy has received less attention in social work research than other aspects of social work practice. This paper draws attention to two tensions in social work advocacy; between worker-led advocacy and person-led advocacy, and between individual advocacy and system level advocacy. We argue that human-rights-based social workers must choose a person-led approach over a worker-led approach while advocating with both systems and individuals. This argument is made by drawing on findings of an evaluation of Independent Mental Health Advocacy (IMHA) in Victoria, Australia. It is shown that social work training had not prepared social workers for rights-based, person-led advocacy and that social workers in public mental health services were struggling to maintain the rights of people in their services even with assistance from IMHA. IMPLICATIONS Independent Mental Health Advocacy (IMHA) is a model of advocacy influenced by social work theory and delivered in part by social-work-trained advocates. Social work training is not preparing social workers for person-led, human-rights-based advocacy. Public mental health social workers are struggling to maintain the rights of people in mental health services even with the support of external advocacy services.

Social media features as well as the strategy of suitable social media design could respond to campaign objectives in terms of contents, types of social media, and the analysis of target audiences or the movement participants, networking including the mainstream media attention to report the news. Though the genuine power of social movements is rooted in the numbers of real life movement participants, social media are vital to increase the amount of online followers as well. Finally, tactics of social media were applied to integrate marketing into media design for social movements. ;

Attention and Emotion Demands in Video Gaming Video gaming actively demands players\\u2019 attention, affording positive experiences like flow. Recent research has suggested to extend analysis from cognitive and physical to the social and emotional demands of gameplay. This paper argues that Erving Goffman\\u2019s concept of interaction tension offers a promising theoretical model for social demands. We report a re-analysis of qualitative interview data on the social norms of video gaming corroborating the model. As suggested by Goffman, video gaming features rich social norms regarding involvement. When spontaneously experienced and normatively demanded involvement misalign, players experience self-conscious disinvolvement and engage in unenjoyable, effortful self-control of their experienced and displayed involvement.

Robust driver attention prediction for critical situations is a challenging computer vision problem, yet essential for autonomous driving. Because critical driving moments are so rare, collecting enough data for these situations is difficult with the conventional in-car data collection protocol\\u2014tracking eye movements during driving. Here, we first propose a new in-lab driver attention collection protocol and introduce a new driver attention dataset, Berkeley DeepDrive Attention (BDD-A) dataset, which is built upon braking event videos selected from a large-scale, crowd-sourced driving video dataset. We further propose Human Weighted Sampling (HWS) method, which uses human gaze behavior to identify crucial frames of a driving dataset and weights them heavily during model training. With our dataset and HWS, we built a driver attention prediction model that outperforms the state-of-the-art and demonstrates sophisticated behaviors, like attending to crossing pedestrians but not giving false alarms to pedestrians safely walking on the sidewalk. Its prediction results are nearly indistinguishable from ground-truth to humans. Although only being trained with our in-lab attention data, the model also predicts in-car driver attention data of routine driving with state-of-the-art accuracy. This result not only demonstrates the performance of our model but also proves the validity and usefulness of our dataset and data collection protocol.

Social support, family environment conditions and the neighboring social environment are components of social capital that contribute to the health of pregnant women. The Indonesia Healthy Family-Program Approach (HIP-FA) supports efforts to empower families to provide social support to pregnant women, thereby increasing self-efficacy in pregnancy that will lead to giving birth to healthy babies. This paper aims to describe the social capital and efficacy of pregnant women. Method: This study was a qualitative study that described social capital, empowerment, and self-efficacy of pregnant women during pregnancy. The article search was through PubMed, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords used to search the articles included: pregnant women, self-efficacy, social capital, and empowerment. The author examined and synthesized various kinds of literature that were closely related to social capital in providing self-efficacy for pregnant women. Results: Social capital affects health and is the main determinant of health. The important social capital is social support for pregnant women by empowering families to give better attention during pregnancy. A healthy Indonesian program with a family approach (HIP-FA) is organized in order to increase the government's attention in overcoming health problems by involving family directly in planning activities, monitoring and evaluation processes, so that the families understand well the health problems of pregnant women in their families and can provide social support in dealing with mental health disorders of pregnant women and increasing self-confidence to be mothers and parent. Conclusion: Social support is a social capital that can improve family empowerment by paying more attention to the health of pregnant women. Social capital in the form of family cohesion and family environment can improve the self-efficacy of pregnant women and prevent pregnancy complications to prepare for the birth of a healthy baby.

New technical developments provide tools to implicit measure overt attention on fear-related stimuli via eye-tracking in ecological valid virtual environments presented via a head-mounted display. We examined in 27 low (LSA) and 26 high socially anxious (HSA) individuals fear ratings, physical behavior (duration of approach), hypervigilance (time to first fixation), and attentional avoidance (count of fixations) toward virtual female and male agents (CS) during social fear conditioning (SFC) and extinction in virtual reality (VR). As hypothesized, generally SFC was successfully induced and extinguished concerning the fear ratings. Our findings partly support the vigilance-avoidance hypothesis as HSA directed especially at the first half of the fear acquisition their initial attention more at CS+ than CS\\u2212 agents, and avoided subsequently the CS+ more than the CS\\u2212 agents during the fear acquisition. In contrast, in LSA participants initial and sustained attention did not differ between CS+ and CS\\u2212 agents during fear acquisition. We conclude that HSA individuals guide their initial attention to emotionally threatening stimuli and subsequently avoid the threatening stimuli to possibly reduce their emotional distress, whereas LSA individuals regulate themselves less in their (fear) responses during SFC. Measuring implicit gaze behavior within a well-controlled virtual environment is an interesting innovative tool to in deeply investigate the impact of attention on emotional learning processes. social anxiety disorder; social fear conditioning; vigilance-avoidance hypothesis; eye-tracking; virtual reality; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Jonas Reichenberger; Michael Pfaller; Andreas M\\u00fchlberger\"},{\"id\":\"fc8379c8eaeb5a7cf229ae74d5af0317f7768e0d58060f5139a504c1704b20b1\",\"content\":\"Editorial: Tourism and Social Regeneration Research on social regeneration is a very specific area that needs more attention in the tourism and social sciences literature.

Introduction Social media is increasingly used in the dissemination of medical research. Traditional measures of the impact of a paper do not account for this. Altmetrics are a measure of the dissemination of a publication via social media websites. The purpose of this study is to ascertain if the altmetric attention score of an article is a reliable measure of the impact it has in the field of critical care medicine. To this end, we investigated if a correlation exists between future citation count and altmetric attention score. Methods The top nine journals by impact factor in the field of critical care medicine were identified for 2014 and 2015. The 100 most cited articles from these journals were recorded to form the Scientific Impact Group, i.e. those with the greatest impact on the scientific community. The altmetric attention score was recorded for each article. The top 100 articles by altmetric attention score were also identified to form the Media Impact Group, i.e. those that generated the most online attention. Their citation counts\\u2019 were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed on each group to identify a correlation between altmetric attention score and citation count. Results There was a moderately positive correlation in the Scientific Impact Group, with a Spearman r score of 0.4336 ( P = 0.0001). A weakly positive correlation was found in the Media Impact Group, with a Spearman r score of 0.3033 ( P = 0.002). Conclusions There is a positive correlation between traditional bibliographic metrics and altmetrics in the field of critical care medicine. Highly cited papers are more likely to generate online attention. However, papers that generate a lot of online attention are less likely to have a high citation count. Therefore, altmetric attention score is not a reliable predictor of future citation count in critical care medicine.

In the laboratory, however, joint attention is often investigated using computerized gaze cueing tasks that do not allow shared gaze. Instead, these computerized tasks require the participant to maintain fixation on the virtual partner's face, while the partner gazes to the left or right. Here we designed a modified gaze cueing task that better simulates a natural joint attention episode by allowing shared gaze, while still maintaining tight experimental control. In our computerized task the participant's gaze and the gaze of a virtual partner were manipulated independently, resulting in shared or unshared gaze. Following each gaze shift of the virtual partner a touch stimulus was delivered on one of the cheeks of the participant. We analyzed behavioral and neural (electro-encephalography) responses to the touch. Faster reaction-times and stronger lateralization of alpha power were observed when the touched cheek was in a jointly attended hemispace compared with a singly attended or unattended hemispace. Importantly, these effects were unique to joint attention and could not be explained as the additive effects of own gaze and gaze cue direction. Underlining its social nature, we found that the behavioral effect was absent when we repeated our experiment with nonsocial cues (arrows) instead of gaze cues. Furthermore, when we compared trustworthy with untrustworthy virtual partners (trustworthiness judgements based on facial appearance) we found the effect only for trustworthy and not for untrustworthy virtual partners. We conclude that joint attention based on shared gaze influences attentional orienting such that cross-modal sensory processing at the jointly attended location is facilitated, particularly when the partner is trustworthy. This indicates that social interactions and trustworthiness judgements affect cortical and behavioral responses to sensory information.

Despite an increasing number of studies suggesting an emergence of cross-cultural differences in early childhood, relatively little is known about how these culturally divergent patterns of attention are acquired and maintained. It has been largely assumed that socialization practices, especially parent\\u2013child interactions, contribute to the acquisition of cross-cultural differences in attention. By focusing on maternal narratives during the shared reading activity, this study examined the socialization contexts in which mothers direct their infants\\u2019 attention in the United States ( n = 50 dyads) and Japan ( n = 53 dyads). Mothers in the United States and Japan read a picture book to their 6- to 18-month-old infants in the lab, and maternal narratives were coded to identify attention to focal objects and social interactions. Infants\\u2019 sustained attention was also measured during shared reading. The findings demonstrated that during the shared reading activity, U.S. mothers were relatively more likely to focus on the focal objects than the background, whereas Japanese mothers were more likely to refer to the social interactions between focal objects and the background. Infants\\u2019 age and gender were not related to maternal narratives, and infants\\u2019 sustained attention was similar across cultures. Findings suggest significant cross-cultural differences in mother\\u2013infant interactions, which may act as scaffolds for infants to internalize their parents\\u2019 cognitive styles.

Previous work has shown that judging the gaze direction of a non-foveally-presented face is facilitated when the eyes of that face are directed towards the centre of the scene. This finding has been interpreted as an example of the human bias for misattributing observed ambiguous gaze signals as self-directed eye contact. To test this interpretation against an alternative hypothesis that the facilitation is instead driven by the establishment of joint attention, we conducted two experiments in which we varied the participants\\u2019 fixation location. In both experiments we replicated the previous finding of facilitated gaze discrimination when the participants fixated centrally. However, this facilitation was abolished when participants fixated peripheral fixation crosses (Experiment 1) and reversed when participants fixated peripheral images of real-world objects (Experiment 2). Based on these data, we propose that the facilitation effect is consistent with the interpretation that gaze discrimination is facilitated when joint attention is established. This finding therefore extends previous work showing that engaging in joint attention facilitates a range of social cognitive processes.   Edwards, Stephen; Siebert, Nathalie; Bayliss, Andrew\"}]"
