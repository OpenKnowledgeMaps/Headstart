Adolescents' attention-seeking motives were examined as a mediator of these over-time associations. In line with this model's account of self-image failure, we also expected that narcissistic youth's attention-seeking should increase following experiences of ego threat, such as social rejection.

In line with predictions, earlier adolescent narcissism predicted later social media disclosure, problematic use, and smartphone stress, via increased attention-seeking.

However, the majority of evidence for this claim comes from studies where the social partner is not physically present and the participants are children. Consequently, to ensure acquisition of a comprehensive overview of social attention in autism, systematic analysis of factors known to influence face-to-face social attention in neurotypicals is necessary and evidence from adulthood is required. This study assessed the influence of experimenter gaze direction (direct or averted) and conversational phase (speaking or listening) on social attention during a face-to-face conversation. Eye-tracking analyses indicated that when the experimenter looked directly at the participant, autistic adults looked at the experimenter's face less than did neurotypical adults. However, this between-group difference was significantly reduced when the experimenter's gaze was averted. Therefore, opportunities for reciprocal social gaze are missed by autistic adults when the social partner makes direct eye contact. A greater proportion of time was spent fixating the experimenter's eye region when participants were speaking compared to listening in both neurotypical and autistic adults. Overall, this study provides a rich picture of the nature of social attention in face-to-face conversations adopted by autistic adults and demonstrates individual variation in social attention styles.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-02-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Freeth, M.; Bugembe, P.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.whiterose.ac.uk\\/127553\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"d79b8e8a28f64eae286aa6dc9b1f99afbe7a407fdbfc3fef4c15903d44c52517\",\"relevance\":118,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"fec393fab4cef064d662f32a7e51f9aa83329b683398e6e277c6799e2b03550d\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1887\\/133387\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1887\\/133387\",\"title\":\"Indicators of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and social attention during emotional clips in relation to aggression in 3-year-olds\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Research indicates that impaired empathy is a risk factor of aggression and that social attention is important for empathy. The role of social attention in associations between empathy and aggression has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, indicators of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, social attention, and aggression were simultaneously assessed in children aged 45 months. A total of 61 mother-child dyads participated in a lab visit, during which maternal reports of aggression were obtained. Children watched three clips showing a sad, scared, and happy child, respectively, and a neutral social clip while heart rate was recorded. Heart rate change from nonsocial baseline clips to emotional clips was calculated as an index of affective empathy. Questions about the emotions of the children in the clips were asked to assess cognitive empathy. Social attention was defined as time spent looking at faces during the clips. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between affective empathy and aggression and between social attention and aggression. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that the association between affective empathy and aggression was moderated by social attention; the negative association between affective empathy and aggression was stronger in children with relatively reduced social attention. No association was found between cognitive empathy and aggression. Therefore, both affective empathy and social attention are important targets for early interventions that aim to prevent or reduce aggression. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture.

Multisensory and dynamic events have been shown to elicit more attention and produce greater sustained attention in infants than auditory or visual events alone. Such redundant and often temporally synchronous information guides selectivity and facilitates perception, learning, and memory of properties of events specified by redundancy. In addition, events involving faces or other social stimuli provide an extraordinary amount of redundant information that attracts and sustains attention. In the current study, 4- and 8-month-old infants were shown 2-min multimodal videos featuring social or nonsocial stimuli to determine the relative roles of synchrony and stimulus category in inducing attention. Behavioral measures included average looking time and peak look duration, and convergent measurement of heart rate (HR) allowed for the calculation of HR-defined phases of attention: Orienting (OR), sustained attention (SA), and attention termination (AT). The synchronous condition produced an earlier onset of SA (less time in OR) and a deeper state of SA than the asynchronous condition. Social stimuli attracted and held attention (longer duration of peak looks and lower HR than nonsocial stimuli). Effects of synchrony and the social nature of stimuli were additive, suggesting independence of their influence on attention. These findings are the first to demonstrate different HR-defined phases of attention as a function of intersensory redundancy, suggesting greater salience and deeper processing of naturalistic synchronous audiovisual events compared with asynchronous ones.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-03-27T18:48:43Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Infant attention; Intersensory perception; Intersensory redundancy; Temporal synchrony; Social and nonsocial stimuli; Heart rate\",\"subject\":\"Infant attention; Intersensory perception; Intersensory redundancy; Temporal synchrony; Social and nonsocial stimuli; Heart rate\",\"authors\":\"Curtindal, Lori M.; Bahrick, Lorraine E.; Lickliter, Robert; Colombo, John\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1808\\/30195\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"c29c0d995d74db71b89f9f8d2b900db5dd1a19af67d2909985ca76fb420ea6a8\",\"relevance\":113,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"072d53d7033260db1b5d1806ce8336a1374583224875cefcf79935090f33c865\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s003329171900031x; https:\\/\\/www.cambridge.org\\/core\\/services\\/aop-cambridge-core\\/content\\/view\\/S003329171900031X\",\"title\":\"Heritability of reflexive social attention triggered by eye gaze and walking direction: common and unique genetic underpinnings\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Social attention ability is crucial for human adaptive social behaviors and interpersonal communications, and the malfunction of which has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a highly genetic neurodevelopmental disorder marked by striking social deficits.

The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record ; Coordinating actions with others is crucial for our survival. Our ability to see what others are seeing and to align our visual attention with them facilitates these joint actions. In the present research, we set out to increase our understanding of such joint attention by investigating the extent to which social information would be able to prioritize overt (when moving the eyes to attend) and covert (when shifting attention without eye movements) attention in a joint spatial cueing task. Participants saw a cue and detected a target at the same or a different location alongside an unseen partner of either higher or lower social rank. In a novel twist, participants were led to believe that the cue was connected to the gaze location of their partner. In Experiment 1, where participants were told to not move their eyes (covert attention), the partner's social rank did not change how quickly participants detected targets. But in Experiment 2, where participants were free to move their eyes naturally (overt attention), inhibition of return effects (slower responses to cued than uncued targets) were modulated by their partner's social rank. These social top-down effects occurred already at a short SOA of 150 ms. Our findings suggest that overt attention might provide a key tool for joint action, as it is penetrable for social information at the early stages of information processing. ; SAGE Junior Research Fellowship.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Joint attention; Social attention; Overt attention; Covert attention; Social status; Inhibition of return; Spatial cueing\",\"subject\":\"Joint attention; Social attention; Overt attention; Covert attention; Social status; Inhibition of return; Spatial cueing\",\"authors\":\"Gobel, MS; Giesbrecht, B\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10871\\/123485\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"25cf60c0e316c5e4b49a6233bed6cd944aaf115835e9578b3c5bef3b8da9ba80\",\"relevance\":110,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"4ed17873352951beb8ad2b9c7ad52cf928b8109b156243a065050fcb83ce0cac\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.1080\\/13683500.2018.1561653; issn:1368-3500; issn:1747-7603; orcid:0000-0002-5337-9005; orcid:0000-0001-5176-3161; DP110101347\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/espace.library.uq.edu.au\\/view\\/UQ:3ed1f92\",\"title\":\"Do tourists notice social responsibility information?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This empirical study explores the amount of attention tourists pay to social responsibility (environment and community) information when booking accommodation online.

These networks can be modulated by different contextual and relational situations. Aim of this review is to explain how a combination of natural and social stimuli can positively affect the attentional processes. It has been proposed that the exposition to natural environment can positively affect direct attention, a common resource supporting both executive functioning and self-regulation processes in cognition. It has been suggested that the decrease of the effort required to voluntary control attention from the bottom upwards could determine some internal reflection that may support creative thinking secondarily to a simultaneous reduction in the effort required to orient attention between thoughts and impressions. In my view, not only exposition to natural and green environment improves attentional processes but also the involvement in social relationship. The development of the orientation and inhibitory control networks is sensitive to the social nature of the stimuli, for instance, in a task, including socially relevant stimuli the efficiency of these two attentional networks increases in children, in adults and in elderly subjects. Social attention, starting very early in the life (joint attention) is a very important mechanism for the regulation of social relationships. A key for a better development of cognitive functions such as attentional processes is the promotion of the immersion in the natural environment and the involvement in social relationship.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships\",\"subject\":\"natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships\",\"authors\":\"Federico, Francesca\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11573\\/1422537\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"cb02adabbbcfb41c21e7b98e6afe78d7ac6ddb444be9dcbb07439bc15c050dce\",\"relevance\":108,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"907f3ded4cbd1174d56305a3fd75947e896c8a1492016bef1f7769fc36dffa29\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/orca.cf.ac.uk\\/122242\\/1\\/van%20Goozen.%20Indicators%20of%20affective.pdf; Noten, M.M.P.G., Van der Heijden, K.

Children watched three clips showing a sad, scared, and happy child, respectively, and a neutral social clip while heart rate was recorded.

Questions about the emotions of the children in the clips were asked to assess cognitive empathy. Social attention was defined as time spent looking at faces during the clips. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between affective empathy and aggression and between social attention and aggression. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that the association between affective empathy and aggression was moderated by social attention; the negative association between affective empathy and aggression was stronger in children with relatively reduced social attention. No association was found between cognitive empathy and aggression.

Although training for top-down attentional control has been an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder, few studies have demonstrated that individuals with social anxiety have top-down attentional dysfunction. This study used dichotic listening (DL) tasks to investigate the relationship between social anxiety and top-down attentional control over relevant brain activities. We also investigated relationships between both social situation-dependent self-focused attention and external attention bias and situation-independent attentional control. Thirty-six healthy participants underwent near-infrared spectroscopy scanning while performing top-down selective and divided attention DL tasks. Then, they undertook a speech task and completed a questionnaire to assess the degrees of their self-focused attention and external attention bias. The results showed that the degree of social fear and self-focused attention during the speech task were negatively correlated with scores on the selective attention task and with the activity of the left pars opercularis during the selective DL task, which were related to each other. These results suggest that a relationship exists between social fear, self-focused attention in a social situation, and top-down selective attentional dysfunction as assessed both behaviorally and by brain activity changes.\",\"published_in\":\"Perceptual and Motor Skills ; volume 126, issue 6, page 1101-1116 ; ISSN 0031-5125 1558-688X\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology; Sensory Systems\",\"subject\":\"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology; Sensory Systems\",\"authors\":\"Tomita, Nozomi; Imai, Shoji; Kanayama, Yusuke; Kumano, Hiroaki\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0031512519867798\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"b8fec5a7f2e385148416f3604822c88f125d14148b7d3a321e59de580a8c20e0\",\"relevance\":104,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0031512519867798\"},{\"id\":\"80c4f1da4260c990df6503db68c023a337c46839b6ce448009fc64d4fe382ea7\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.1007\\/s10329-019-00721-4; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/pmid\\/30941537; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/eissn\\/1610-7365; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/urn\\/urn:nbn:ch:serval-BIB_ED250B9AEB6A3; https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/notice\\/serval:BIB_ED250B9AEB6A; doi:10.1007\\/s10329-019-00721-4; urn:issn:0032-8332; https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/resource\\/serval:BIB_ED250B9AEB6A.P001\\/REF.pdf; http:\\/\\/nbn-resolving.org\\/urn\\/resolver.pl?urn=urn:nbn:ch:serval-BIB_ED250B9AEB6A3\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/notice\\/serval:BIB_ED250B9AEB6A; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s10329-019-00721-4; https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/resource\\/serval:BIB_ED250B9AEB6A.P001\\/REF.pdf; http:\\/\\/nbn-resolving.org\\/urn\\/resolver.pl?urn=urn:nbn:ch:serval-BIB_ED250B9AEB6A3\",\"title\":\"Social attention biases in juvenile wild vervet monkeys: implications for socialisation and social learning processes.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The concept of directed social learning predicts that social learning opportunities for an individual will depend on social dynamics, context and demonstrator identity. However, few empirical studies have examined social attention biases in animal groups. Sex-based and kinship-based biases in social learning and social attention towards females have been shown in a despotic and female philopatric primate: the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The present study examined social attention during the juvenile period. Social attention was recorded through 5-min focal observations during periods of natural foraging. Kin emerged as the most important focus of social attention in juveniles, intensified by biased spatial proximity towards matrilineal related members. The highest-ranking conspecifics were more frequently observed by juveniles than low-ranking ones. Additionally, younger and orphaned juveniles showed higher levels of social attention overall, compared to other age categories. No effect of the juvenile's hierarchical rank was detected, suggesting that the variation in social attention recorded reflects different biases and stages of social learning and socialisation, rather than social anxiety. Juvenile females tended to exhibit a dominance-based bias more strongly than did males. This might be explained by a greater emphasis on attaining social knowledge during juvenile socialisation in the philopatric sex. Moreover, despite a preferred association between juveniles, social attention was more often directed to adults, suggesting that adults may still be more often chosen as a target of attention independent of their dominance rank.\",\"published_in\":\"Primates; journal of primatology, vol. 60, no. 3, pp. 261-275\",\"year\":\"2019-05\",\"subject_orig\":\"Age Factors; Animals; Wild\\/psychology; Attention; Behavior; Animal; Cercopithecus aethiops\\/psychology; Female; Grooming; Male; Social Behavior; Social Dominance; Social Learning; Socialization; Early social experience; Female philopatry; Juvenile socialisation; Rank acquisition; Social learning biases; Social network\",\"subject\":\"Age Factors; Animals; Wild\\/psychology; Attention; Behavior; Animal; Cercopithecus aethiops\\/psychology; Female; Grooming; Male; Social Behavior; Social Dominance; Social Learning; Socialization; Early social experience; Female philopatry; Juvenile socialisation; Rank acquisition; Social learning biases; Social network\",\"authors\":\"Grampp, M.; Sueur, C.; van de Waal, E.; Botting, J.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/serval.unil.ch\\/notice\\/serval:BIB_ED250B9AEB6A\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"80c4f1da4260c990df6503db68c023a337c46839b6ce448009fc64d4fe382ea7\",\"relevance\":103,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"eca26e105d51e98184e671396503cf278d39762c24453baea690932127f5f18c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fnhum.2020.00201\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1662-5161; 1662-5161; doi:10.3389\\/fnhum.2020.00201; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e2867caedcef4b6cbf7bc06280d9cd0c\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fnhum.2020.00201; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/e2867caedcef4b6cbf7bc06280d9cd0c\",\"title\":\"Joint Attention During Live Person-to-Person Contact Activates rTPJ, Including a Sub-Component Associated With Spontaneous Eye-to-Eye Contact\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Eye-to-eye contact is a spontaneous behavior between interacting partners that occurs naturally during social interactions. However, individuals differ with respect to eye gaze behaviors such as frequency of eye-to-eye contacts, and these variations may reflect underlying differences in social behavior in the population. While the use of eye signaling to indicate a shared object of attention in joint attention tasks has been well-studied, the effects of the natural variation in establishing eye contact during joint attention have not been isolated. Here, we investigate this question using a novel two-person joint attention task. Participants were not instructed regarding the use of eye contacts; thus all mutual eye contact events between interacting partners that occurred during the joint attention task were spontaneous and varied with respect to frequency. We predicted that joint attention systems would be modulated by differences in the social behavior across participant pairs, which could be measured by the frequency of eye contact behavior. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and eye-tracking to measure the neural signals associated with joint attention in interacting dyads and to record the number of eye contact events between them. Participants engaged in a social joint attention task in which real partners used eye gaze to direct each other\\u2019s attention to specific targets. Findings were compared to a non-social joint attention task in which an LED cue directed both partners\\u2019 attention to the same target. The social joint attention condition showed greater activity in right temporoparietal junction than the non-social condition, replicating prior joint attention results. Eye-contact frequency modulated the joint attention activity, revealing bilateral activity in social and high level visual areas associated with partners who made more eye contact. Additionally, when the number of mutual eye contact events was used to classify each pair as either \\u201chigh eye contact\\u201d or \\u201clow eye contact\\u201d dyads, cross-brain coherence analysis revealed greater coherence between high eye contact dyads than low eye contact dyads in these same areas.

This study explores the systematic effects of internal and external attention on both economic and social performance. Design\\/methodology\\/approach First, theoretically, hypotheses linking different attention allocations to ambidextrous behavior and entrepreneurial performance were formulated. Subsequently, the empirical studies based on Chinese social entrepreneurship were conducted to test the hypotheses. Findings The study provides support to the hypotheses showing that external attention is linked to resource acquisition and social performance, while internal attention is linked to resource acquisition and strategic human resource management and thus these ambidextrous behaviors promote both social and economic performance. Furthermore, normal pressure moderates the relations between internal attention and strategic human resource management only. Research limitations\\/implications The research measures entrepreneurs\\u2019 attention with questionnaire rather than psych test. Also, static data rather than longitudinal research is designed to test the hypotheses.

Visual and auditory attention was mapped from age 1 week to 5 months in infants at familial risk for ASD (high risk; N = 41) and low-risk typically developing infants (low risk; N = 39). At 12 months, a subset of participants ( N = 40) was administered assessments of social communication and nonverbal cognitive skills. Results revealed that high-risk infants performed lower on attention tasks at 2 and 3 months of age compared to low-risk infants. A significant association between overall attention at 3 months and developmental outcome at 12 months was observed for both groups. These results provide evidence for early vulnerabilities in visual attention for infants at risk for ASD during a period of important neurodevelopmental transition (between 2 and 3 months) when attention has significant implications for social communication and cognitive development.\",\"published_in\":\"Development and Psychopathology ; volume 32, issue 2, page 491-501 ; ISSN 0954-5794 1469-2198\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Developmental and Educational Psychology; Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"subject\":\"Developmental and Educational Psychology; Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"authors\":\"Bradshaw, Jessica; Klin, Ami; Evans, Lindsey; Klaiman, Cheryl; Saulnier, Celine; McCracken, Courtney\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0954579419000233\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"c52e8ad1ac9eaaffac24e31b2b7114a6783441ddd8196cb08430bc2670e9ca99\",\"relevance\":100,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0954579419000233\"},{\"id\":\"41258c8c0693820d9a4e0024ce95529cb1874337a6b9d6e6c66e642b732f37bb\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ro.uow.edu.au\\/buspapers\\/1609; https:\\/\\/ro.uow.edu.au\\/cgi\\/viewcontent.cgi?article=2627&context=buspapers\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ro.uow.edu.au\\/buspapers\\/1609; https:\\/\\/ro.uow.edu.au\\/cgi\\/viewcontent.cgi?article=2627&context=buspapers\",\"title\":\"Do tourists notice social responsibility information?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This empirical study explores the amount of attention tourists pay to social responsibility (environment and community) information when booking accommodation online.

Average SCL was lower in the ASD group, but no group difference in arousal reactivity (change from baseline to emotional phases) was detected. Lower SCL during video clips was related to autism symptom severity across participants (r = \\u2212.29). ASD individuals reported lower emotional awareness. We conclude that, even though no deviations in social attention or emotional reactivity were found in ASD, an overall lower level of social attention and arousal may help explain difficulties in social functioning in ASD.\",\"published_in\":\"10 ; Frontiers in Psychiatry\",\"year\":\"2020-01-24T19:15:51Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Dijkhuis, R.; Gurbuz, E.; Ziermans, T.; Staal, W.; Swaab, H.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1887\\/83271\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e45a3bf278945e60f68017837de94ef1145f340ea16cd14f146383be8e3ce4bc\",\"relevance\":97,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"7ca009074ce9a17dfb2aee05687b441088e1ef836da05e006cd9900faabe939a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/journal.pone.0225603; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1932-6203; 1932-6203; doi:10.1371\\/journal.pone.0225603; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9db16d6064f242aead3ca8a3a17d94ba\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/journal.pone.0225603; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/9db16d6064f242aead3ca8a3a17d94ba\",\"title\":\"Visual attention to emotional faces in adolescents with social anxiety disorder receiving cognitive behavioral therapy.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a psychiatric condition that often onsets in childhood.

Materials and Methods The method of this study was semi- experimental with purposive sampling with pre-test and post-test for control group. For this aim, 40 male students were diagnosed as ADHD who were selected by clinical interview and Conner's questionnaire and randomly 20 participants were assigned in the experimental group and 20 were assigned in the control group. In order to measure the variables of the research, Stroop task, continuous performance test, Wisconsin Card Sorting test, and divided attention test were used. Attention training was presented on the experimental group in 8 sessions, using a set of related cognitive games and attention-based task .For data analysis, covariance analysis was used. Results The results indicated that attention training significantly increased the sustained attention performance and response inhibition of children with ADHD, but there was no significant effect on the selective attention function, shifting attention and divided attention.

This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other\\u2019s mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.\",\"published_in\":\"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review ; volume 27, issue 6, page 1126-1138 ; ISSN 1069-9384 1531-5320\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology; Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous); Developmental and Educational Psychology\",\"subject\":\"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology; Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous); Developmental and Educational Psychology\",\"authors\":\"Battich, Lucas; Fairhurst, Merle; Deroy, Ophelia\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.3758\\/s13423-020-01766-z\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"970867849095017ee7b68ebc4321193bb499764d8cde22e9e57206ec2129cc1c\",\"relevance\":93,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.3758\\/s13423-020-01766-z\"},{\"id\":\"757835635802a983446ce03b19141f2e1fa5236efb06ebe43956c9ef05a5904a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.repository.cam.ac.uk\\/handle\\/1810\\/277556; doi:10.17863\\/CAM.24870\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.repository.cam.ac.uk\\/handle\\/1810\\/277556; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17863\\/CAM.24870\",\"title\":\"Infants' visual sustained attention is higher during joint play than solo play: is this due to increased endogenous attention control or exogenous stimulus capture?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Previous research has suggested that when a social partner, such as a parent, pays attention to an object, this increases the attention that infants pay to that object during spontaneous, naturalistic play. There are two contrasting reasons why this might be: first, social context may influence increases in infants\\u2019 endogenous (voluntary) attention control; second, social settings may offer increased opportunities for exogenous attentional capture. To differentiate these possibilities, we compared 12-month-old infants\\u2019 naturalistic attention patterns in two settings: Solo Play and Joint Play with a social partner (the parent). Consistent with previous research we found that infants\\u2019 look durations toward play objects were longer during Joint Play, and that moments of inattentiveness were fewer, and shorter. Follow-up analyses, conducted to differentiate the two above-proposed hypotheses, were more consistent with the latter hypothesis. We found that infants\\u2019 rate of change of attentiveness was faster during Joint Play than Solo Play, suggesting that internal attention factors, such as attentional inertia, may influence looking behaviour less during Joint Play. We also found that adults\\u2019 attention forwards-predicted infants\\u2019 subsequent attention more than vice versa, suggesting that adults\\u2019 behaviour may drive infants\\u2019 behaviour. Finally, we found that mutual gaze did not directly facilitate infant attentiveness. Overall, our results suggest that infants spend more time attending to objects during Joint Play than Solo Play, but that these differences are more likely attributable to increased exogenous attentional scaffolding from the parent during social play, rather than to increased endogenous attention control from the infant.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"Humans; Physical Stimulation; Infant Behavior; Parents; Social Perception; Attention; Play and Playthings; Adult; Infant; Young Adult\",\"subject\":\"Humans; Physical Stimulation; Infant Behavior; Parents; Social Perception; Attention; Play and Playthings; Adult; Infant; Young Adult\",\"authors\":\"Wass, Sam V; Clackson, Kaili; Georgieva, Stanimira; Brightman, Laura; Nutbrown, Rebecca; Leong, Victoria\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.repository.cam.ac.uk\\/handle\\/1810\\/277556\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"757835635802a983446ce03b19141f2e1fa5236efb06ebe43956c9ef05a5904a\",\"relevance\":92,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"ba22c43d6f67c3e231214fb6e8676d37df300f1e9598fdca78366bcb8c697486\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/psyjournals.ru\\/en\\/psyedu_ej\\/2020\\/n1\\/Smirnova.shtml; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2587-6139; doi:10.17759\\/psyedu.2020120108; 2587-6139; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c3e447ff12f1498ab16e5d4974d69008\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17759\\/psyedu.2020120108; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c3e447ff12f1498ab16e5d4974d69008\",\"title\":\"Joint Attention and Sensitivity to Orienting Gaze in Children with Atypical Development\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The article is devoted to the study of the relationship between the mechanism of joint attention and the subsequent normative and atypical development of the child. It is shown that the ability to establish joint attention based on the direction of the interlocutor's gaze is a precursor of the emergence of social and cognitive abilities. The study examined the differences between typical developmental children and atypical development control groups in their ability to be sensitive to social behavioral signals, namely the orientation direction of the interlocutor's gaze. On a sample of 120 children with typical development, mental retardation, hearing impairment, speech disorders and visual impairment, a number of tasks were developed to assess the ability to use the character's direction of sight in the picture to determine its intentions. The task measured such a skill of joint attention as the child\\u2019s ability to calculate and report what the other person was looking at and what he intended to choose. We also used tasks with a central hint with an explicit indication of an arrow and a peripheral hint to check the recognition of social and non-social orienting signals. Based on the comparison of contrasting groups, the variability of the formation and age-related changes in skills of joint attention, or rather the presence of differences in recognition, synthesis and interpretation orienting social information coming from eye contact. It was found that children with atpic development have a low level of \\\"downward\\\" joint attention. Impaired joint attention may be one of the earliest signs in children with atypical development at a later age. The results showed that deficiencies in the behavior of joint attention vary depending on mental age and level of development, a sensory defect, so the level of development can really affect the ability of children to joint attention.\",\"published_in\":\"Psihologo-Pedagogi\\u010deskie Issledovani\\u00e2, Vol 12, Iss 1, Pp 105-121 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"attention; joint attention; social cognition; age-related development; preschool age; theory of mind; mental model; mental retardation; autism; Education; L\",\"subject\":\"attention; joint attention; social cognition; age-related development; preschool age; theory of mind; mental model; mental retardation; autism; Education; L\",\"authors\":\"Smirnova Ya.K.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17759\\/psyedu.2020120108\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ba22c43d6f67c3e231214fb6e8676d37df300f1e9598fdca78366bcb8c697486\",\"relevance\":91,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17759\\/psyedu.2020120108\"},{\"id\":\"a5d6f1814d370210d76f77c88df8fcc8a8f244d53b44df2ee4c0b7a3a1d730f1\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8687172; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1854\\/LU-8687172; http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.neubiorev.2019.08.017; https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8687172\\/file\\/8692967\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8687172; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1854\\/LU-8687172; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.neubiorev.2019.08.017; https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8687172\\/file\\/8692967\",\"title\":\"Neural correlates of emotion-attention interactions : from perception, learning, and memory to social cognition, individual differences, and training interventions\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Due to their ability to capture attention, emotional stimuli tend to benefit from enhanced perceptual processing, which can be helpful when such stimuli are task-relevant but hindering when they are task-irrelevant.

This comprehensive approach enabled an integrative overview of the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of emotion-attention interactions at multiple levels of analysis, and identification of emerging directions for future investigations.\",\"published_in\":\"NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS ; ISSN: 0149-7634 ; ISSN: 1873-7528\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences; Medicine and Health Sciences; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EPISODIC-SPECIFICITY INDUCTION; REMITTED DEPRESSED-PATIENTS; SKIN-CONDUCTANCE RESPONSES; REGULATORY BRAIN-FUNCTION; NON-CONSCIOUS RECOGNITION; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; Emotion; Attention; Perception; Learning and memory; Individual differences; Training interventions; Psychophysiology; Neuroimaging; Affective neuroscience; Health and well-being; Linguistics\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences; Medicine and Health Sciences; POSTTRAUMATIC- EVENT-RELATED FMRI; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EPISODIC-SPECIFICITY INDUCTION; REMITTED  SKIN-CONDUCTANCE RESPONSES; REGULATORY  NON-CONSCIOUS RECOGNITION; CEREBRAL- Emotion; Attention; Perception; Learning and memory; Individual differences; Training interventions; Psychophysiology; Neuroimaging; Affective neuroscience; Health and well-being; Linguistics\",\"authors\":\"Dolcos, Florin; Katsumi, Yuta; Moore, Matthew; Berggren, Nick; de Gelder, Beatrice; Derakshan, Nazanin; Hamm, Alfons O.; Koster, Ernst; Ladouceur, Cecile D.; Okon-Singer, Hadas; Pegna, Alan J.; Richter, Thalia; Schweizer, Susanne; Van den Stock, Jan; Ventura-Bort, Carlos; Weymar, Mathias; Dolcos, Sanda\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8687172\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a5d6f1814d370210d76f77c88df8fcc8a8f244d53b44df2ee4c0b7a3a1d730f1\",\"relevance\":90,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"767068f7df8daf0855b9687517dd508cde3ee1e3fcc34dc617c0165adcdc66e6\",\"relation\":\"Laamanen, Tomi (2019) Dynamic attention-based view of corporate headquarters in MNCs.

In this point of view, I review the development of the attention-based view and its use in research on CHQs in MNCs. Developing a better understanding of the dynamics of attention between the different subsidiaries and the increasingly dispersed and disaggregated headquarters activities in MNCs requires a more dynamic view of attention. Building on the recently introduced dynamic attention-based view, I identify potential research areas emerging from the application of the dynamic attention-based view to research on CHQ activities in MNCs.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-08-21\",\"subject_orig\":\"business studies; social sciences\",\"subject\":\"business studies; social sciences\",\"authors\":\"Laamanen, Tomi\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.alexandria.unisg.ch\\/260107\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"767068f7df8daf0855b9687517dd508cde3ee1e3fcc34dc617c0165adcdc66e6\",\"relevance\":89,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"457498795b06c9b87d8e84a69d70d9cea1d98aef2a5eecd4efc1652c5a24c059\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/ijec.ejournal.id\\/index.php\\/counseling\\/article\\/view\\/88\\/49; http:\\/\\/ijec.ejournal.id\\/index.php\\/counseling\\/article\\/view\\/88; doi:10.30653\\/001.201932.88\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ijec.ejournal.id\\/index.php\\/counseling\\/article\\/view\\/88; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.30653\\/001.201932.88\",\"title\":\"Peran Regulasi Emosi dan Perhatian Orang Tua pada Social Problem-Solving Remaja yang Bersekolah Asrama\",\"paper_abstract\":\"THE ROLE OF EMOTION REGULATION AND PARENTAL ATTENTION ON SOCIAL PROBLEM-SOLVING OF BOARDING SCHOOL'S ADOLESCENT. This study aimed to know the correlation of emotion regulation and parental attention to social problem solving of boarding school adolescents. The research subjects were 65 students of SMAN CMBBS who were selected by simple random sampling method. The instruments used are social problem-solving scale, emotion regulation scale, and parental attention scale. Data were analyzed by multiple regression analysis. The results showed that there was a significant correlation between emotion regulation and parental attention with social problem solving for SMAN CMBBS adolescents, with p = 0.00 (R = 0.699). Partial correlation test proves that there is a significant correlation between emotional regulation and social problem solving for SMAN CMBBS adolescents (p = 0.00; rx1y = 0.549). Partial correlation also proves that there is a significant relationship of parental attention to social problem solving for adolescent CMBBS (p = 0.032; rx2y = 0.268).

The present review draws together studies that have measured the orienting of attention, following observation of another\\u2019s goal-directed action. Our review proposes that, in line with the literature on eye gaze, action is a particularly strong orienting cue for the visual system. However, we additionally suggest that action may orient visual attention using mechanisms, which gaze direction does not (i.e., neural direct mapping and corepresentation). Finally, we review the implications of these gaze-independent mechanisms for the study of attention to action. We suggest that our understanding of attention to action may benefit from being studied in the context of joint action paradigms, where the role of higher level action goals and social factors can be investigated.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-10\",\"subject_orig\":\"BF Psychology\",\"subject\":\"BF Psychology\",\"authors\":\"Atkinson, MA; Simpson, AA; Cole, GG\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/repository.essex.ac.uk\\/20632\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ec0b231d1cb089abcab672d5c7a1ebfff4c5a7661facfa169b1e37e3487d079a\",\"relevance\":87,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"b492ba6f20834c1d13634150bf6b42eb0621502f6628fa6db6d22dbcc5213b22\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2071-1050\\/10\\/11\\/4029; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2071-1050; 2071-1050; doi:10.3390\\/su10114029; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f1d1371aefdd4a54bcce68b99fb3f5ec\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/su10114029; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f1d1371aefdd4a54bcce68b99fb3f5ec\",\"title\":\"Managerial Humanistic Attention and CSR: Do Firm Characteristics Matter?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study attempted to investigate the influence of managerial humanistic attention on corporate social responsibility.

Real\\u2010life social behavior was measured using structured behavior observations, parent questionnaires, and developmental interviews. Time spent looking at social stimuli was significantly associated with real\\u2010life social behaviors, and independent of age, IQ, or gender. Paradigms involving social interactions and looking time to the eyes showed the most consistent relations with social behaviors. Stronger affective arousal responses were associated with shorter looking times toward eyes, which in turn were associated with less social awareness in real life. Eyetracking and arousal measures allow for sensitive and objective assessment of social abilities that have great relevance for real\\u2010life social behaviors, with the potential to use in a broad and diverse population.

Typically, this bias has been conceptualized as driven by an overactive bottom-up attentional system; however, this potentially overlooks the role of top-down attention in being able to modulate this bottom-up bias. Here, the role of top-down mechanisms in directing attention toward emotional faces was assessed with a modified dot-probe task, in which participants were given a top-down cue (\\\"happy\\\" or \\\"angry\\\") to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial, and the cued face was either presented with a face of the other emotion (angry, happy) or a neutral face. This study found that social anxiety was not associated with differences in shifting attention toward cued angry faces. However, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were selectively impaired in attentional shifting toward a cued happy face when it was paired with an angry face, but not when paired with a neutral face. The results indicate that top-down attention can be used to orient attention to emotional faces, but that higher levels of social anxiety are associated with selective deficits in top-down control of attention in the presence of threat.

The current study included 63 college students with social anxiety. Participants were assigned to the attention modification program (AMP, n = 20), the attention control condition (ACC, n = 20) and the passive waiting group (PW, n = 23). Questionnaires and the emotional Stroop task with EEG recordings were used to assess whether and how the 4-week ABM period affected emotional symptoms and specific emotional processing. Results showed that the two training groups (AMP and ACC) produced comparable emotional improvements and both showed a decrease in negative bias compared with the PW group. The ERP results indicated that despite no significant ERP changes in the PW group, the ACC group exhibited a greater N1, whereas the AMP group exhibited a reduced VPP at the post-test stage compared to the pre-test stage. Besides, both training groups showed a similar late positive potential (LPP) reduction. Notably, the reduction in LPP was positively correlated with behavioral and symptom improvement. Thus, manipulations unique to ABM (face-target contingency) primarily modulate the early attention distribution of material-related stimuli. However, the clinical benefits of attention training may be due to later cognitive-affective mechanisms.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"Attention bias modification; social anxiety; event-related potentials; interpretation bias; transfer effect\",\"subject\":\"Attention bias modification; social anxiety; event-related potentials; interpretation bias; transfer effect\",\"authors\":\"Pan Dong-ni; Wang Yi; Zheng Lei; Wang Yang; Li Xuebing\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/31776\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"4598cd71d37d4a5d578b36505d8e9c3d72cab29ca87334599c5a11f2f51d533e\",\"relevance\":77,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\",\"Report\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"c11413296bd987b8afe64c1d862149ebaf1afb00ca3e9a5d6c1b87826a3b6597\",\"relation\":\"halshs-02055117; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117\\/document; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117\\/file\\/RevueCOI_04_Cosmod%C3%A9lie_Damian_1811.pdf\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117\\/document; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117\\/file\\/RevueCOI_04_Cosmod%C3%A9lie_Damian_1811.pdf\",\"title\":\"Cosmod\\u00e9lie : sc\\u00e8nes de l'attention\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Le surgissement de la question de l\\u2019attention ( nos attentions ! ) dans l\\u2019espace public marque \\u00e0 la fois les menaces qui p\\u00e8sent sur elle, du fait de toutes les formes de pr\\u00e9dation dont elle fait l\\u2019objet, et le souci renouvel\\u00e9 de collectivement r\\u00e9apprendre \\u00e0 \\u00ab faire attention \\u00bb.

Relating gender differences in cognitive attention networks to digital distraction\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In response to increasing concerns about digital distraction, we bridged people's cognitive attention to digital distraction within the personal learning environment (PLE). Gender differences were investigated in college students' media-related perceived attention problems (PAP) and their attention self-regulatory strategies (SRS). Also examined were the gender moderating effects on the correlations of attention problems and regulatory strategies with six dimensions of social media usage and four cognitive- and adjustment-related criteria: online search strategies, media-multitasking self-efficacy (MMSE), positive\\/negative self-esteems, and academic achievement. Participants were 771 undergraduate and graduate students from 10 universities in Taiwan. Gender measurement invariance was established in the research instrument. Males exhibited higher PAP than females. Females demonstrated more versatile strategy use to regulate their attention with increased social media use, while males applied more behavioral strategies over social media use as disorientation increased during online searches. Higher MMSE was associated with higher executive and orienting problems for females, and higher alerting problems for males. Higher orienting problems was associated with more negative self-esteem for males. Females with higher PAP reported poorer academic achievement. Implications for practical intervention of PAPs are discussed for each gender group to promote college students' psychological well-being with regard to social media use and learning performance.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Gender studies; Meta-attention; Digital distraction; Media multitasking self-efficacy; Self-esteem; Social Media\",\"subject\":\"Gender studies; Meta-attention; Digital distraction; Media multitasking self-efficacy; Self-esteem; Social Media\",\"authors\":\"Wu, Jiun-Yu; Cheng, Tzuying\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11536\\/148550\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f292d133195eaa07f56c8dabdc73e0e7e5baf4475cd5ed36a65001f3768fd80e\",\"relevance\":75,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"59d5340db789a2133f574cb72d505fea2c28592b0ac505dffbbaa3d2d935e529\",\"relation\":\"halshs-02055117; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117\\/document; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117\\/file\\/RevueCOI_04_Cosmod%C3%A9lie_Damian_1811.pdf\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117\\/document; https:\\/\\/halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/halshs-02055117\\/file\\/RevueCOI_04_Cosmod%C3%A9lie_Damian_1811.pdf\",\"title\":\"Cosmod\\u00e9lie : sc\\u00e8nes de l'attention\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Le surgissement de la question de l\\u2019attention ( nos attentions ! ) dans l\\u2019espace public marque \\u00e0 la fois les menaces qui p\\u00e8sent sur elle, du fait de toutes les formes de pr\\u00e9dation dont elle fait l\\u2019objet, et le souci renouvel\\u00e9 de collectivement r\\u00e9apprendre \\u00e0 \\u00ab faire attention \\u00bb.

Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.\",\"published_in\":\"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review\",\"year\":\"2020-07-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophie; Wissenschaftstheorie und Religionswissenschaft; ddc:150; ddc:570\",\"subject\":\"Philosophie; Wissenschaftstheorie und Religionswissenschaft;  \",\"authors\":\"Battich, Lucas; Fairhurst, Merle T.; Deroy, Ophelia\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de\\/72900\\/1\\/Battich_Fairhurst_Deroy_2020_Coordinating_attention_requires_coordinated_sense.pdf\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"ef86ef03aaa8607832110df187effc854d231c1a7892c95ac25a1b85360cdeb4\",\"relevance\":72,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"24f795f2e125f59fe014d3eee0f8678deb0bf66d0e45a10d2a97564c79e1e133\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0308022620902681; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/0308022620902681; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/0308022620902681\",\"title\":\"The impact of person\\u2013environment\\u2013occupation transactions on joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder: A scoping review\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Introduction Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrate difficulty with joint attention, affecting social and occupational performance. Studies of joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder employ a variety of instrumentation, environments and occupations. From the occupational therapy perspective, current literature lacks a rigorous analysis of the transactions of person, environment and occupation embedded within the procedures of these studies. The goal of this scoping review was to investigate how these components transact to affect occupational performance. Method Using the Person\\u2013Environment\\u2013Occupation model as an evaluative lens, a scoping review was completed to summarize person, environment and occupation transactions in studies examining joint attention in children aged 6\\u201312 years with autism spectrum disorder. Results Six studies were included. Findings indicated that simplified social environments and demonstrations of joint attention promoted higher joint attention performance in children with autism spectrum disorder, at the cost of ecological validity. Maintaining ecological validity in complex social environments resulted in lower joint attention performance. Conclusion The Person\\u2013Environment\\u2013Occupation model can be used to develop an occupational therapy perspective on literature from outside the discipline.

Loneliness is a motivational factor for building and maintaining social connections. Automatic attention occurs with little cognitive effort and plays a key role in detecting biologically salient events, such as human faces. Although previous studies have investigated the effect of loneliness on social behavior, the effect of loneliness on automatic attention to human faces remains largely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of loneliness on automatic visual attention to warmth and competence facial information, which determines facial attraction. This study included 43 participants who rated warmth and competence facial information. Then, they engaged with the target-distractor paradigm in which they saw two house images at the top and bottom and indicated whether the images were identical. During the task, we presented two faces as distractors and measured visual attention toward the faces as automatic attention because participants did not have to attend to the faces. The results showed an interactive effect between subjective loneliness and facial information on automatic attention. Warm targets automatically captured the attention of people feeling relatively lonely, whereas competent targets automatically captured the attention of those who felt less lonely. These results suggest that loneliness adaptively influences automatic processing of social information.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 10 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"automatic attention; competence; loneliness; social cognition; warmth; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"automatic attention; competence; loneliness; social cognition; warmth; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Toshiki Saito; Kosuke Motoki; Rui Nouchi; Ryuta Kawashima; Motoaki Sugiura\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2019.02967\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"b6222e10a85b25b8c18a8ab3732d78ce15806948fe1cb583a62b03e096e5f0d2\",\"relevance\":69,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2019.02967\"},{\"id\":\"1a2706dd903b99c13ae88c50c1121c5982edd71da46c23dd4553deda6ff2fb8d\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/eprints.gla.ac.uk\\/190856\\/1\\/190856.pdf; Williams, E.

Adult learners often rely on a situational context to learn and understand a new word's meaning. Here, we explored whether interactive learning facilitates word learning by directing the learner's attention to a correct new word referent when a situational context is non-informative. We predicted larger involvement of inferior parietal, frontal, and visual cortices involved in visuo-spatial attention during interactive learning. We scanned participants while they played a visual word learning game with and without a social partner. As hypothesized, interactive learning enhanced activity in the right Supramarginal Gyrus when the situational context provided little information. Activity in the right Inferior Frontal Gyrus during interactive learning correlated with post-scanning behavioral test scores, while these scores correlated with activity in the Fusiform Gyrus in the non-interactive group. These results indicate that attention is involved in interactive learning when the situational context is minimal and suggest that individual learning processes may be largely different from interactive ones.

However, little is known about the influence of social anxiety on adolescents' brain and behavior. The present study investigated the neural basis of social anxiety using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional connectivity analysis. Then we investigated whether social anxiety is associated with attention bias. Furthermore, we investigated the neural basis of this association. Finally, longitudinal data was used to test if these biomarkers could predict social anxiety. The results indicated that social anxiety is positively associated with the grey matter volume (GMV) of orbital-frontal cortex (OFC), and the functional connectivity (FC) of OFC-amygdala. Mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between social anxiety and attention avoidance is partly mediated by the FC of OFC-amygdala. Finally, the present study demonstrated a close relationship between FC of the OFC-amygdala, the GMV of the OFC and the individual's social anxiety one year later. The present study suggested the aberrant structure of OFC and its connectivity with amygdala as the neural underpinning of social anxiety, which might serve as a compensatory mechanism to decrease attention avoidance and promote effective emotion regulation.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social anxiety; Attention bias; OFC; Amygdala; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Developmental; Neurosciences; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; EMOTION REGULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DISORDER; FACES; CHILDREN; THREAT; FEAR; HYPERACTIVITY\",\"subject\":\"Social anxiety; Attention bias; OFC; Amygdala; Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Developmental; Neurosciences; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; EMOTION REGULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DISORDER; FACES; CHILDREN; THREAT; FEAR; HYPERACTIVITY\",\"authors\":\"Mao, Yu; Zuo, Xi-Nian; Ding, Cody; Qiu, Jiang\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/32314\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"56ed4192953b533f0dbe5d44d91facdcf7fc5898afa66886329493400a534abe\",\"relevance\":62,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\",\"Report\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"32ed4a5eba1f817bf2233c35f893af3d88f0f8aacb11282bf3f895370503c810\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fpsyt.2019.00426\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1664-0640; 1664-0640; doi:10.3389\\/fpsyt.2019.00426; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/eec84e558fd040f0955f696e8f46a5c8\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyt.2019.00426; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/eec84e558fd040f0955f696e8f46a5c8\",\"title\":\"Social Attention and Emotional Responsiveness in Young Adults With Autism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are generally characterized by marked impairments in processing of social emotional information, but less is known about emotion processing in adults with the disorder.

IMPROVING VISUAL ATTENTION TO SOCIAL STIMULI IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Social dysfunction is a hallmark characteristic of schizophrenia, and individuals with this disorder often report difficulty navigating daily social interactions. Perceptual deficits, such as faulty visual attention to important aspects of social stimuli (i.e., failing to look at the most relevant portions of a stimulus), may be one mechanism by which social deficits arise. Faulty modulation of specific neural regions such as the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), may underlie visual attention abnormalities, and may act as suitable targets for neurostimulation. The current study utilizes neurostimulation to experimentally manipulate specific neural networks and determine whether stimulation 1) improves visual attention, 2) improves performance on social cognitive tasks, and 3) whether altered visual attention moderates this improved performance. Methods Using a double-blind crossover design, participants underwent both active and sham stimulation via tDCS approximately one week apart. Half of the participants received active and sham stimulation of rTPJ (n = 22), while the other half received active and sham stimulation of a comparator site within the social brain network (dmPFC, n = 23). After stimulation, visual attention was assessed through concurrent eye-tracking while participants complete several tasks of social cognition (emotion recognition: ER40, BLERT; Theory of Mind: TASIT). Visual attention was determined as the proportion of time spent attending to socially and contextually important AOIs. Results Data collection and data processing are still ongoing for this study, however planned interim analyses on a subset of the total sample (n = 45) indicate small to medium effects of active stimulation to the rTPJ compared to sham and dmPFC stimulation for both visual attention (\\u03b7p2=.035) and social cognitive performance on the BLERT task (\\u03b7p2=.067), specifically. These same effects are not seen in the other social cognitive tasks. Final analyses based on a sample size of 72 individuals are expected to be complete prior to presentation at SIRS 2020. Discussion This study is the first, to our knowledge, to target this neural region within schizophrenia for the purposes of improving visual attention and, subsequently, social cognition. Should the pattern of results from our interim analyses hold after completion of data collection, results indicate that active stimulation to the rTPJ has a unique impact on dynamic emotional stimuli, improving visual attention and accuracy in emotion recognition, suggesting a primary role of the rTPJ and visual attention in performance on this task. The intricate design of this study allows for thorough investigation of potential mechanisms by which social cognitive deficits develop, and the use of novel experimental techniques align with the theme of this year\\u2019s conference.\",\"published_in\":\"Schizophrenia Bulletin ; volume 46, issue Supplement_1, page S161-S162 ; ISSN 0586-7614 1745-1701\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"subject\":\"Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"authors\":\"Klein, Hans; Pinkham, Amy\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/schbul\\/sbaa030.381\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"d51cb2628e079a1549b9afc6aac40c0aed98a391bfa6a14bea1b2f9419f1d175\",\"relevance\":59,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/schbul\\/sbaa030.381\"},{\"id\":\"087713501ac5c1c449db7dd8906bde2fe2d2711bfb28fd490ebc08b982ea825d\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/schbul\\/sbaa029.787; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/schizophreniabulletin\\/article-pdf\\/46\\/Supplement_1\\/S319\\/33286416\\/sbaa029.787.pdf\",\"title\":\"T227. VIRTUAL REALITY SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING IMPROVES SOCIAL ATTENTION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Background Social impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia presenting a major barrier to recovery. Although antipsychotic medications can reduce psychotic symptoms, social impairments often persist, contributing to poor outcome. Validated interventions, such as Social Skills Training (Bellack et al., 2004), target a broad range of social domains but they yield only modest effect sizes for social outcome (Pfammatter et al, 2006). Moreover, conventional social interventions suffer from high burden on the clients and therapists, low adherence, lack of personalization, and low generalizability. Importantly, social interventions are not widely available. Virtual reality (VR) offers a viable alternative to conventional therapies with several advantages including high acceptability, an extensive repertoire of stimuli, low-burden, low-cost and safety (Strickland, 1997). Importantly, VR allows for a precise targeting of social cognitive mechanisms. Social attention, the fast orientation and allocation of resources to social stimuli can be indexed by tracking eye movements. Abnormal eye scanning behavior during social interactions has been linked to poor social functioning in schizophrenia (Brunet-Gouet & Decety, 2006). We designed a VR-based social skills training game to directly target social attention in schizophrenia. Methods Eighteen individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) participated in the VR training game twice a week for 5 weeks. Eye movement patterns were recorded throughout the training. Subjects were required to solve social \\u201cmissions\\u201d (e.g., obtain personal information through conversations with avatars) in different naturalistic scenarios. To start a mission, participants had to fixate on the chosen avatar. The latency to engage in a social interaction was indexed by the fixation time (social engagement latency). Each session consisted of 12 missions. We compared social engagement latency and eye gaze patterns pre- and post-training to assess the efficacy of the VR social skills training program. Results Social engagement latency significantly decreased after 10 sessions (d=0.78). This result suggests that prosocial attention benefitted from VR training. We also found that the standard deviation of dwell time (i.e., proportion of time spent looking at the avatar\\u2019s face during a conversation) significantly increased across training sessions (d=0.56). This result suggests an increased modulation of interpersonal engagement during social interaction. Additionally, participants\\u2019 emotion recognition ability significantly increased (\\u03b72 = 0.27), and negative symptoms significantly decreased (\\u03b72=0.34) from pre- to post- training. Importantly, these changes in social attention correlated with improvement in negative symptoms. Discussion Simulated and targeted social interactions with avatars in VR significantly improved social attention in individuals with schizophrenia. Importantly, improvements in negative symptoms and emotion perception after training suggest that this training protocol has an impact on a broad range of social functions. VR training is a promising alternative to traditional psychosocial interventions to target specific mechanisms underlying social functioning in schizophrenia.\",\"published_in\":\"Schizophrenia Bulletin ; volume 46, issue Supplement_1, page S319-S319 ; ISSN 0586-7614 1745-1701\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"subject\":\"Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"authors\":\"Torregrossa, L\\u00e9nie; Ichinose, Megan; Hieber Adery, Laura; Nichols, Heathman; Wade, Joshua; Bian, Dayi; Granholm, Eric; Sarkar, Nilanjan; Park, Sohee\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/schbul\\/sbaa029.787\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"087713501ac5c1c449db7dd8906bde2fe2d2711bfb28fd490ebc08b982ea825d\",\"relevance\":58,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/schbul\\/sbaa029.787\"},{\"id\":\"0d158c50f482c817f5cdea896d9eac9e4a3d17769d9416233df91e6db2302fcb\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.journals.lapub.co.uk\\/index.php\\/perr\\/article\\/view\\/1164\\/1028; https:\\/\\/www.journals.lapub.co.uk\\/index.php\\/perr\\/article\\/view\\/1164\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.journals.lapub.co.uk\\/index.php\\/perr\\/article\\/view\\/1164\",\"title\":\"Effectiveness of a Pivotal Response Training Programme in Joint Attention and Social Interaction of Kindergarten Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The purpose of this study was to provide a training program based on pivotal response for children with autism spectrum disorder, which may affect positively on improving their joint attention and social interaction.

Yet, despite over 40 years of work and hundreds of publications on this topic, there is still surprisingly little agreement on what exactly joint attention is, and how the jointness in it is achieved. Part of the problem, we propose, is that joint attention is not a single process, but rather it includes a cluster of different cognitive skills and processes, and different researchers focus on different aspects of it. A similar problem applies to common knowledge. Here we present a new approach: We outline a typology of social attention levels which are currently all referred to in the literature as joint attention (from monitoring to common, mutual, and shared attention), along with corresponding levels of common knowledge. We consider cognitive, behavioral, and phenomenological aspects of the different levels as well as their different functions, and a key distinction we make in all of this is second-personal vs. third-personal relations.

Specifically, this paper argues that - and why - the exploration of content policies and their enforcement is indispensable when approaching social media platforms and social media data in particular from a critical perspective. A number of researchers have already begun to identify contextual elements that require particular attention when viewing social media and social media data through a CDS lens. However, social media sites' content policies, as pervasive contextual element, have not received adequate research attention yet. Drawing on Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis (CMDA) and recent developments in Social Media CDS (SM-CDS), this paper first demonstrates the existing gap in research. Then, it contends that social media sites' content policies deserve more detailed attention in SM-CDS, argues why this is the case and elaborates on the different aspects of content policies and policy enforcement that require examination.

It has been suggested that the decrease of the effort required to voluntary control attention from the bottom upwards could determine some internal reflection that may support creative thinking secondarily to a simultaneous reduction in the effort required to orient attention between thoughts and impressions. In my view, not only exposition to natural and green environment improves attentional processes but also the involvement in social relationship. The development of the orientation and inhibitory control networks is sensitive to the social nature of the stimuli, for instance, in a task, including socially relevant stimuli the efficiency of these two attentional networks increases in children, in adults and in elderly subjects. Social attention, starting very early in the life (joint attention) is a very important mechanism for the regulation of social relationships. A key for a better development of cognitive functions such as attentional processes is the promotion of the immersion in the natural environment and the involvement in social relationship.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Francesca Federico\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01345\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"74c587c941995942ee7fb73da3f4309cc8ef57d869e8945b0338ef53d7f9ba8a\",\"relevance\":52,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.01345\"},{\"id\":\"3ed614e640187494e80ec2b8c769d8cabb7faafedd9f81294aa64852baa08053\",\"relation\":\"SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE; http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/31690; doi:10.1093\\/scan\\/nsaa038\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.psych.ac.cn\\/handle\\/311026\\/31690; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1093\\/scan\\/nsaa038\",\"title\":\"Neural correlates of negative expectancy and impaired social feedback processing in social anxiety\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Social anxiety has been associated with abnormalities in cognitive processing in the literature, manifesting as various cognitive biases.

Participants were divided into two groups according to their social anxiety level. Participants in the high social anxiety (HSA) group were more likely to predict that they would be socially rejected by peers than did their low social anxiety (LSA) counterparts (i.e. the control group). Compared to the ERP data of the LSA group, the HSA group showed: (a) a larger P1 component to social cues (peer faces) prior to social feedback presentation, possibly indicating an attention bias; (b) a difference in feedback-related negativity amplitude between unexpected social acceptance and unexpected social rejection, possibly indicating an expectancy bias; and (c) a diminished sensitivity of the P3 amplitude to social feedback valence (be accepted\\/be rejected), possibly indicating an experience bias.

An Eye Tracking Analysis\",\"paper_abstract\":\"BackgroundVisual atypicalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are a well documented phenomenon, beginning as early as 2\\u20136 months of age and manifesting in a significantly decreased attention to the eyes, direct gaze and socially salient information. Early emerging neurobiological deficits in perceiving social stimuli as rewarding or its active avoidance due to the anxiety it entails have been widely purported as potential reasons for this atypicality. Parallel research evidence also points to the significant benefits of animal presence for reducing social anxiety and enhancing social interaction in children with autism. While atypicality in social attention in ASD has been widely substantiated, whether this atypicality persists equally across species types or is confined to humans has not been a key focus of research insofar.MethodsWe attempted a comprehensive examination of the differences in visual attention to static images of human and animal faces (40 images; 20 human faces and 20 animal faces) among children with ASD using an eye tracking paradigm. 44 children (ASD n = 21; TD n = 23) participated in the study (10,362 valid observations) across five regions of interest (left eye, right eye, eye region, face and screen).ResultsResults obtained revealed significantly greater social attention across human and animal stimuli in typical controls when compared to children with ASD. However in children with ASD, a significantly greater attention allocation was seen to animal faces and eye region and lesser attention to the animal mouth when compared to human faces, indicative of a clear attentional preference to socially salient regions of animal stimuli. The positive attentional bias toward animals was also seen in terms of a significantly greater visual attention to direct gaze in animal images.ConclusionOur results suggest the possibility that atypicalities in social attention in ASD may not be uniform across species. It adds to the current neural and biomarker evidence base of the potentially greater social reward processing and lesser social anxiety underlying animal stimuli as compared to human stimuli in children with ASD.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"animals; autism (ASD); social attention; visual attention; eye tracking; human animal interaction (HAI); Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"animals; autism (ASD); social attention; visual attention; eye tracking; human animal interaction (HAI); Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Georgitta J.

This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other's mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.\",\"published_in\":\"Psychonomic bulletin & review\",\"year\":\"2020-01-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophie; Wissenschaftstheorie und Religionswissenschaft; ddc:100\",\"subject\":\"Philosophie; Wissenschaftstheorie und Religionswissenschaft; \",\"authors\":\"Battich, Lucas; Fairhurst, Merle T.; Deroy, Ophelia\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de\\/73182\\/1\\/Battich2020_Article_CoordinatingAttentionRequiresC.pdf\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"29c172717dbfe39953f99e2be1fe3417d4f08f4976b1fbb10b51db2d3fc5a110\",\"relevance\":49,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"6475837784f5361d16f24aabf3380982509c91895ee5531be6929b85bc6f75d9\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.frontiersin.org\\/article\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00794\\/full; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1664-1078; 1664-1078; doi:10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00794; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7479c0bbb4d94151b7e87da751462345\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00794; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/7479c0bbb4d94151b7e87da751462345\",\"title\":\"The Effect of Autistic Traits on Social Orienting in Typically Developing Individuals\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by wide ranging and heterogeneous changes in social and cognitive abilities, including deficits in orienting attention during early processing of stimuli. Investigators have found that there is a continuum of autism-like traits in the general population, suggesting that these autistic traits may be examined in the absence of clinically diagnosed autism. To provide evidence for the continuum of autistic traits in terms of social attention and to provide insights into social attention deficits in people with autism, the current study was conducted to examine the effect of autistic traits of typically developing individuals on social orienting using a spatial cueing paradigm. The typically developing individuals who participated in this study were divided into high autistic traits (HA) and low autistic traits groups using the Autism Quotient scale. All participants completed a spatial cueing task in which social cues (gaze) and non-social cues (arrow) were presented under different cue predictability conditions (predictive vs. non-predictive) with different SOAs (100 ms vs. 400 ms). The results showed that compared to low autistic individuals, high autistic individuals had less benefit from non-predictive social cues but greater benefit from non-social ones, providing evidence that such spatial attention impairment in high autistic individuals is specific to the social domain. Interestingly, the smaller benefit from non-predictive social cues in high autistic individuals was shown only in the 400 ms condition, not in the 100 ms condition, suggesting that their difficulties in orienting to non-predictive social cues may be caused by a deficiency in spontaneously effortful control processing.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits; attention orienting; social cues; non-social cues; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits; attention orienting; social cues; non-social cues; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Guoyao Lin; Yanling Cui; Jiajing Zeng; Liang Huang\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00794\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"6475837784f5361d16f24aabf3380982509c91895ee5531be6929b85bc6f75d9\",\"relevance\":48,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2020.00794\"},{\"id\":\"8f1ec1f5c07d7598df916574b1ff18a606feca2aff9dd0b2b3e62bc4d6913b1c\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S187892931830121X; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1878-9293; 1878-9293; doi:10.1016\\/j.dcn.2019.100625; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2b35e9bde36e4476911f6cffe7a21926\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.dcn.2019.100625; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2b35e9bde36e4476911f6cffe7a21926\",\"title\":\"The functional consequences of social attention on memory precision and on memory-guided orienting in development\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Adults are slower at locating targets in naturalistic scenes containing a social distractor compared to an equally salient non-social distractor, and their subsequent memory for targets in social scenes is poorer. Therefore, adults\\u2019 social biases affect not only attention, but also their memory. Six-to-ten year-old children and young adults took part in the current study, employing a combination of behavioural and eye-tracking measures. Social stimuli in naturalistic scenes distracted both children and adults during visual search, as demonstrated by their gaze behavior and search times. In addition, eye-tracking revealed even greater attentional capture by social distractors for children. Memory for targets was worse in social compared to non-social scenes. Intriguingly, children demonstrated overall better memory precision than adults. Finally, when participants detected previously learnt targets within visual scenes, adults were slower for targets appearing at unexpected (invalid) locations within social scenes compared to non-social scenes, but this was not the case for children. In their entirety, these findings suggest that the interplay between social attentional biases, memory and memory-guided attention is complex and modulated by age-related differences. Complementary methodologies in developmental cognitive neuroscience shed light on the mechanisms through which social attention and memory interact over development.

A similar problem applies to common knowledge. Here we present a new approach: We outline a typology of social attention levels which are currently all referred to in the literature as joint attention (from monitoring to common, mutual, and shared attention), along with corresponding levels of common knowledge. We consider cognitive, behavioral, and phenomenological aspects of the different levels as well as their different functions, and a key distinction we make in all of this is second-personal vs. third-personal relations.

But little is known of how our brains support dynamic social interactions. We recorded dual electroencephalography (EEG) from 12-month-old infants and parents during solo play and joint play. During solo play, fluctuations in infants' theta power significantly forward-predicted their subsequent attentional behaviours. However, this forward-predictiveness was lower during joint play than solo play, suggesting that infants' endogenous neural control over attention is greater during solo play. Overall, however, infants were more attentive to the objects during joint play. To understand why, we examined how adult brain activity related to infant attention.

Access to attentional resources was manipulated by sometimes including a distracting stimulus among the presented stimuli. The results of Study 1 revealed that a significant self-referential reward effect emerged under undistracted attentional conditions and was associated with improved task performance when self-owned monetary rewards were available. However, distracted attention impaired this self-referential reward effect. Moreover, distracted attention was also observed in the self-referential social reward processing in Study 2. These results suggested that distracted attention can impair the pursuit advantage for self-relevant rewards; self-referential processing is strongly dependent on attentional resources.\",\"published_in\":\"Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 9 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"self-relevance; attention; social reward; monetary reward; ownership; Psychology; BF1-990\",\"subject\":\"self-relevance; attention; social reward; monetary reward; ownership; Psychology; \",\"authors\":\"Jia Zhu; Youlong Zhan\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2018.02723\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"eaceea3b9a7ed5fd90c8d8eb635d07f5b1df3457f7c07da4796c2289d29a3bd6\",\"relevance\":42,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/fpsyg.2018.02723\"},{\"id\":\"be9bb49fb7ac765d907f23f596e5fff50abf2a157b17d215fd4bdc56b592dde9\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/wos\\/WOS:000518653800005; info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/hdl\\/11573\\/1341572; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11573\\/1341572; doi:10.1016\\/j.anbehav.2019.12.019; 2-s2.0-85078486989\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11573\\/1341572; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.anbehav.2019.12.019\",\"title\":\"Attention to social stimuli is modulated by sex and exposure time in tufted capuchin monkeys\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The dot-probe task is an experimental procedure commonly used to study how animals (including humans) pay attention to different stimuli.

In order to explore this possibility, we adopted a novel social-cue detection methodology: the bodies-in-the-crowd task. Two experiments are reported that consider whether nonverbal cues of pain, happiness and anger as expressed through body postures would capture and hold attention. Both experiments recruited 40 (20 male, 20 female) pain-free individuals. Overall, results show that pain postures do not capture attention any more than happiness or anger postures, but disengagement from pain postures was significantly slower across both studies. Gender differences were also found, and were more likely to be found, when crowds comprised both men and women. Male pain postures were more likely to capture attention. Whilst female observers had faster target detection speed, and were quicker to disengage from distractors. They also showed slower disengagement from female expressions overall. Male observers showed no variation based on target or distractor gender.

Forty-one participants were randomly assigned to either a control or an active training condition of mouse-based contingent attention training (MCAT). Participants in the active condition were instructed to allocate attention toward positive words to generate positive interpretations, by using attention regulation while receiving contingent feedback on their attention to emotional words. Participants in the control condition freely generated interpretations without receiving contingent feedback. Transfer to reappraisal and state rumination was evaluated by administering an emotion regulation paradigm before and after the training. Mouse-based attention estimations showed a high degree of congruency with real eye\\/gaze-based attention estimations, as measured with eye-tracking performed in parallel.

In conjunction search, visual attention is required to select the items and to bind their features (e.g., color, form, size), which results in a serial search process. In dual-tasks, central attention is required for response selection, but because central attention is limited in capacity, response selection can only be carried out for one task at a time. Here, we investigated whether visual and central attention rely on a common or on distinct capacity limitations. In two dual-task experiments, participants completed an auditory two-choice discrimination Task 1 and a conjunction search Task 2 that were presented with an experimentally modulated temporal interval between them (stimulus onset asynchrony [SOA]). In Experiment 1, Task 2 was a triple conjunction search task. Each item consisted of a conjunction of three features, so that target and distractors shared two features. In Experiment 2, Task 2 was a plus conjunction search task, in which target and distractors shared the same four features. The hypotheses for conjunction search time were derived from the locus-of-slack method. While plus conjunction search was performed after response selection in Task 1, a small part of triple conjunction search was still performed in parallel to response selection in Task 1. However, the between-experiment comparison was not significant, indicating that both search tasks may require central attention. Taken together, the present study provides evidence that visual and central attention share a common capacity limitation when conjunction search relies strongly on serial item selection.\",\"published_in\":\"ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS ; ISSN: 1943-3921 ; ISSN: 1943-393X\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences; Visual attention; Visual search; Central attention; Response selection; Locus-of-slack method KeyWords Plus:PSYCHOLOGICAL REFRACTORY PERIOD; RESPONSE-SELECTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; FEATURE-BINDING; GUIDED SEARCH; BOTTLENECK; PARALLEL; PERFORMANCE; DEPLOYMENT; TASKS\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences; Visual attention; Visual search; Central attention; Response selection; Locus-of-slack method KeyWords Plus:PSYCHOLOGICAL REFRACTORY PERIOD;  SPATIAL ATTENTION;  GUIDED SEARCH; BOTTLENECK; PARALLEL; PERFORMANCE; DEPLOYMENT; TASKS\",\"authors\":\"Reimer, Christina; Schubert, Torsten\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8679381\",\"oa_state\":\"0\",\"url\":\"0e6bf14b7184293f9fc3eaae96e2ce001918d2d6e6e43064aef034eedb64610d\",\"relevance\":34,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"9e53e618c8acd27e47299d5b3d6db3c3d0f0af7ed1af22e4a43edea346841a75\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0081246319876145; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/0081246319876145; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/0081246319876145\",\"title\":\"Delay aversion and immediate choice in Sepedi-speaking primary school children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Motivational factors play a significant role in the pathology of attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder and are associated with altered reinforcement sensitivity.

An extensive elaborate study on concepts relating to attention and consciousness dissociation has been done. In this article we also narrow it down to experimental design that requires independent manipulation of each. Which include top-down attention and awareness aspect of consciousness? Main Findings: Many researches have been put forward supporting the independent nature of attention from awareness using sophisticated experimental and physiological shreds of evidence. On the other hand, some researches still stick to the contemporary common-sense notion of no awareness no attention. Our evaluation suggests an independent nature of attention and awareness. Application: This article intends to give a clear perspective of the ongoing debate on the relationship between attention and consciousness. Simplification of both umbrella terms will give basis for building more empirical evidence. Novelty: Further, this article put forward studies on both sides of debate aiming to bridge the gap to get a conclusive outlook in the future.\",\"published_in\":\"Humanities & Social Sciences Reviews; Vol. 7 No. 5 (2019): September; 516-521 ; 2395-6518\",\"year\":\"2019-10-11\",\"subject_orig\":\"awareness; attention; dissociation; top-down attention; cognitive debate\",\"subject\":\"awareness; attention; dissociation; top-down attention; cognitive debate\",\"authors\":\"Agarwal, Aarushi; Patel, Ajeet; Singh, Tara; Tiwari, Trayambak; Lata Singh, Anju\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/giapjournals.com\\/index.php\\/hssr\\/article\\/view\\/hssr.2019.7559\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"7e7709a2a44630702287c0157613a27cec3e6935fbf1c5784034436551bb0035\",\"relevance\":32,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"30b58d89fffc50d969d887f31e59c0ce170fcc9d03c957774b8ca1a336c8f94b\",\"relation\":\"CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING; J00688; 2152-2715; OAK-2019-01406; https:\\/\\/ir.ymlib.yonsei.ac.kr\\/handle\\/22282913\\/169944; doi:10.1089\\/cyber.2018.0377; 2152-2723; 30672714; https:\\/\\/www.liebertpub.com\\/doi\\/abs\\/10.1089\\/cyber.2018.0377; T201901554\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ir.ymlib.yonsei.ac.kr\\/handle\\/22282913\\/169944; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1089\\/cyber.2018.0377; https:\\/\\/www.liebertpub.com\\/doi\\/abs\\/10.1089\\/cyber.2018.0377\",\"title\":\"Development of Virtual Reality Continuous Performance Test Utilizing Social Cues for Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit\\/Hyperactivity Disorder\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Virtual reality (VR) neuropsychological assessments have the potential for the ecological measurement of attention. We analyzed the newly developed VR continuous performance test (VR-CPT) for Korean children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC). To identify specific features of a virtual environment that influence the attention performance of children, we investigated whether the presence of a virtual teacher and social cues in the VR environment affects their attention performance. A total of 38 participants (18 TDC and 20 ADHD children and adolescents) were recruited for VR-CPT testing. Bivariate correlational analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the results of the VR-CPT and ADHD questionnaires to determine the capacity of VR-CPT to mirror real-life attention behaviors. Mixed-design analysis of variables was conducted to compare the effects of the social aspects of the VR-CPT on attention performance in groups. There were significant associations between ADHD rating scores and the omission error, commission error, reaction time (RT), reaction time variability (RTV), and total accuracy of the VR-CPT in the ADHD group. In addition, the ADHD group exhibited comparable performance with the TDC group for all measures of the VR-CPT. Also there seemed to be a trend of decreasing RTV when a virtual teacher with social cues was present compared with the equipment control condition in the ADHD group. Performance in the VR-CPT program was associated with behavioral measures of ADHD symptoms. Adding social aspects to a VR environment commonly encountered by children and adolescents has the potential to make a difference in the attention performance of youths with ADHD. ; restriction\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/classification; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/diagnosis; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/psychology; Child; Cues*; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests*; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality*; attention; continuous performance test; neuropsychological assessment; social cues; virtual reality\",\"subject\":\"Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/classification; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/diagnosis; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/psychology; Child; Cues*; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests*; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality*; attention; continuous performance test; neuropsychological assessment; social cues; virtual reality\",\"authors\":\"\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/ir.ymlib.yonsei.ac.kr\\/handle\\/22282913\\/169944\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"30b58d89fffc50d969d887f31e59c0ce170fcc9d03c957774b8ca1a336c8f94b\",\"relevance\":31,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e63f199c27e6c892dde177ea80de6f2aec072e775f87aea69a0dfca7e554712e\",\"relation\":\"NHMRC 192107 & 434213; http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/au-research\\/grants\\/nhmrc\\/192107; http:\\/\\/purl.org\\/au-research\\/grants\\/nhmrc\\/434213; Journal of Anxiety Disorders--0887-6185--1873-7897 Vol. 74 No. 102273\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.janxdis.2020.102273; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1959.7\\/uws:57307\",\"title\":\"The structure of social-evaluative threat detection in social anxiety disorder\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The integrated aetiological and maintenance (IAM) model of social anxiety disorder (SAD) conceptualises four social-evaluative cognitive processes (anticipatory processing, attention to the self, attention to threat in the environment, and post-event processing) as facets of a social-evaluative threat detection construct. The current study tested this by examining potential factor structures underlying the four social-evaluative cognitive processes. Baseline data from two randomised controlled trials, consisting of 306 participants with SAD who completed measures of the four social-evaluative cognitive processes in relation to a speech task, were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. Model fit indices and bifactor model indices showed that the optimal factor structure was a bifactor model with a Social-evaluative Threat Detection General Factor and two group factors corresponding to anticipatory processing and post-event processing. Analyses also indicated that the Social-evaluative Threat Detection General Factor had moderate to large associations with other constructs in the IAM model, whereas the two group factors only had small associations with these constructs. These findings suggest that the four social-evaluative cognitive processes can be unified as facets of a social-evaluative threat detection process, consistent with the IAM model, although group factors for anticipatory processing and post-event processing need to be taken into account.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"XXXXXX - Unknown; social phobia; threats; attention; factor analysis\",\"subject\":\"XXXXXX - Unknown; social phobia; threats; attention; factor analysis\",\"authors\":\"Wong, Quincy (R19194); McEvoy, Peter M.; Rapee, Ronald M.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.janxdis.2020.102273\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e63f199c27e6c892dde177ea80de6f2aec072e775f87aea69a0dfca7e554712e\",\"relevance\":30,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.janxdis.2020.102273\"},{\"id\":\"707abda48899f3713221e898e2011b55738994cd5d345532c6b596d936b9a650\",\"relation\":\"International Journal of Neurological Disorders. 2019, 3 (1), 004-006.; urn:issn:2639-7021; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2589853; cristin:1680307\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11250\\/2589853\",\"title\":\"Establishment of Stability in Social Interest and Other Prerequisites for Communication in People with Profound Learning Difficulties\",\"paper_abstract\":\"When we interact with people with profound learning difficulties, we often experience that the contact breaks down.

We examined preparatory coding in the human hippocampus and mPFC, two regions that are important for memory-guided behaviors, in two tasks: one where attention was guided by memory and another in which attention was explicitly instructed. Hippocampus and mPFC exhibited higher activity for memory-guided vs. explicitly instructed attention. Furthermore, representations in both regions contained information about upcoming attentional states. In the hippocampus, this preparation was stronger for memory-guided attention, and occurred alongside stronger coupling with visual cortex during attentional guidance.

In the present study, across four experiments, these three attentional processes were differentiated using a variation of the dot-probe task, in which participants were cued to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial. Results show that attention toward facial expressions was not exclusively driven by bottom-up attentional capture; instead, participants could shift their attention toward both happy and angry faces in a top-down manner. This effect was not found when the faces were inverted, indicating that top-down attention relies on holistic processing of the face. In addition, no evidence of selection history was found (i.e., no improvement on repeated trials or blocks of trials in which the task was to orient to the same expression).

A limitation of this literature is the lack of empirical work that has explicitly characterized how this relationship manifests itself over time. We investigate this issue by analysing data from two large eye-tracking datasets (total n = 176). Via growth-curve analysis, we demonstrate that self-reported empathy (as measured by the empathy quotient\\u2014EQ) predicts the temporal evolution of gaze behaviour under conditions where social and non-social stimuli compete for attention. In both datasets, we found that EQ not only predicted a global increase in social attention, but predicted a different temporal profile of social attention. Specifically, we detected a reliable effect of empathy on gaze towards social images after prolonged viewing. An analysis of switch latencies revealed that low-EQ observers switched gaze away from an initially fixated social image more frequently and at earlier latencies than high-EQ observers. Our analyses demonstrate that modelling these temporal components of gaze signals may reveal useful behavioural phenotypes. The explanatory power of this approach may provide enhanced biomarkers for conditions marked by deficits in empathy-related processes.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018-12\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Hedger, Nicholas; Haffey, Anthony; McSorley, Eugene; Chakrabarti, Bhismadev\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/centaur.reading.ac.uk\\/81241\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"74e0d79ab150a8cd08f6d0a4bbf9df2ffbfb5abaea6999e2fb6ab6523f002147\",\"relevance\":22,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"6fbe3462a9a84dbc07b057ec5bab5954e70afff2b5952fa2e60eef9b41ae43da\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/revistas.unal.edu.co\\/index.php\\/idval\\/article\\/view\\/73084\\/pdf_2; Baron-Cohen, S. \\u201cThe Eye Direction Detector (edd) and the Shared Attention Mechanism (sam): Two Cases for Evolutionary Psychology.\\u201d Joint Attention: Its origins and Role in Development.

Previous work on joint attention has shown that even minimal shared experiences such as watching something together facilitates social closeness between individuals. Here, we examined whether young children already connect with others through joint attention. In the current studies, children sat next to a novel adult who either watched a film with them or was not able to see the film and read a book instead. After the video, we measured children\\u2019s willingness (i.e., latency) to approach the experimenter holding out a toy. In both studies, the 2.5-year-olds who watched the film together approached more quickly than the other children. These results show that both minimally interactive shared experiences and noninteractive shared experiences lead children to feel more comfortable with a novel adult. This suggests that joint attention interactions, and shared experiences in general, play an important role not only in children\\u2019s cognitive development but also in their social development and the formation of their social relationships.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wolf, W.; Tomasello, M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/21.11116\\/0000-0005-5A5C-0\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"aab5577b53689f18c394ed631097843f058c1989b74ada7eaacebff8be77d993\",\"relevance\":20,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"3563acf71b9ade30e141a8a111287bd67f2e0fa4e174d5765a5c97c66503586c\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/hdl\\/11381\\/2886110; volume:61; issue:2; firstpage:228; lastpage:238; numberofpages:11; journal:DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY; urn:ISSN:0012-1630; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11381\\/2886110; doi:10.1002\\/dev.21797; 2-s2.0-85055629084\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/11381\\/2886110; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1002\\/dev.21797\",\"title\":\"Visual preferences for direct-gaze faces in infant macaques (Macaca mulatta) with limited face exposure\",\"paper_abstract\":\"From birth, human and nonhuman primates attend more to faces with direct gaze compared with averted gaze, and previous studies report that attention to the eyes is linked to the emergence of later social skills.

We aimed to study temporal dynamics of learning processes in classical fear conditioning to social cues (neutral faces) by selecting an experimental setup that produces large effects on well-studied ERP components (early posterior negativity ; EPN ; late positive potential ; LPP ; stimulus preceding negativity ; SPN) and then exploring small consecutive groups of trials. EPN ; LPP ; and SPN markedly and quickly increased during the acquisition phase in response to the CS+ but not the CS. These changes were visible even at high temporal resolution and vanished completely during extinction. Moreover ; some evidence was found for component differences in extinction learning ; with differences between CS+ and CS extinguishing faster for late as compared to early ERP components.

In the single task, angry voices increased the occipital N2 component relative to neutral voices in women, but not men. In the dual task, angry voices relative to neutral voices increased occipital N1 and N2 components, as well as accuracy, in women and marginally decreased accuracy in men. Thus, in women, vocal anger produced a strong, multifaceted visual enhancement comprising attention-dependent and attention-independent processes, whereas in men, it produced a small, behavior-focused visual processing impairment that was strictly attention-dependent.

As a result, less is known about the female ASD phenotype. Recent research suggests that conclusions drawn from predominantly male samples may not accurately capture female behavior. In this study, we explore potential sex differences in attention to social stimuli, which is generally reported to be diminished in ASD. Population-based sex differences in attention to faces have been reported, such that typically developing (TD) females attend more to social stimuli (including faces) from infancy through adulthood than TD males. It is yet unknown whether population-based sex differences in the face domain are preserved in ASD. Methods A dynamic, naturalistic infrared eye-tracking paradigm measured attention to social stimuli (faces) in 74 school-aged males and females with ASD (male N = 23; female N = 19) and without ASD (male N = 16; female N = 16). Two kinds of video stimuli were presented that varied in social content: rich social scenes (dyadic play between two children) and lean social scenes (parallel play by two children). Results Results revealed a significant 3-way interaction between sex, diagnosis, and condition after controlling for chronological and mental age. ASD females attended more to faces than ASD males in the socially lean condition. This effect was not found in the typically developing (TD) group. ASD males attended less to faces regardless of social context; however, ASD females only attended significantly less to faces compared to TD females in the socially rich condition. TD males and ASD females did not differ in their attention to faces in either condition. Conclusions This study has implications for how the field understands core social deficits in children with ASD, which should ideally be benchmarked against same-sex peers (male and female). Social attention in ASD females fell on a continuum\\u2014greater than their ASD male peers, but not as great as TD females. Overall, their social attention mirrored that of TD males. Improved understanding of the female social phenotype in ASD will enhance early screening and diagnostic efforts and will guide the development of sex-sensitive experimental paradigms and social interventions.\",\"published_in\":\"Molecular Autism, Vol 10, Iss 1, Pp 1-10 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Autism spectrum disorder; Sex differences; Social cognition; Eye gaze; Social attention; Neurology.

However, not all BI children develop anxiety. Attention bias (AB) may enhance the vulnerability for anxiety in BI children, and interfere with their development of effective emotion regulation. In order to fully probe attention patterns, we used traditional measures of reaction time (RT), stationary eye-tracking, and recently emerging mobile eye-tracking measures of attention in a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds characterized as BI ( N = 23) or non-BI ( N = 58) using parent reports. There were no BI-related differences in RT or stationary eye-tracking indices of AB in a dot-probe task. However, findings in a subsample from whom eye-tracking data were collected during a live social interaction indicated that BI children ( N = 12) directed fewer gaze shifts to the stranger than non-BI children ( N = 25). Moreover, the frequency of gazes toward the stranger was positively associated with stationary AB only in BI, but not in non-BI, children. Hence, BI was characterized by a consistent pattern of attention across stationary and ambulatory measures. We demonstrate the utility of mobile eye-tracking as an effective tool to extend the assessment of attention and regulation to social interactive contexts.\",\"published_in\":\"Development and Psychopathology ; volume 31, issue 3, page 971-988 ; ISSN 0954-5794 1469-2198\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Developmental and Educational Psychology; Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"subject\":\"Developmental and Educational Psychology; Psychiatry and Mental health\",\"authors\":\"Fu, Xiaoxue; Nelson, Eric E.; Borge, Marcela; Buss, Kristin A.; P\\u00e9rez-Edgar, Koraly\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0954579419000427\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"37d5193ce5ffbb9dc085a254567b376ba89017654e096e1660fe40f7003661ea\",\"relevance\":13,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s0954579419000427\"},{\"id\":\"e0df5d224b5a460e2140dc334c5728343064f0d5fc300d3c9648776aadbfcc4f\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.3898\\/NEWF:98.07.2019; hal-02912252; https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-02912252; https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-02912252\\/document; https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-02912252\\/file\\/Citton-AutomaticEndoAttention-2019.pdf; doi:10.3898\\/NEWF:98.07.2019\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-02912252; https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-02912252\\/document; https:\\/\\/hal.archives-ouvertes.fr\\/hal-02912252\\/file\\/Citton-AutomaticEndoAttention-2019.pdf; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3898\\/NEWF:98.07.2019\",\"title\":\"Automatic Endo-Attention, Creative Exo-Attention: the Egocidal and Ecocidal Logic of Neoliberal Capitalism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; The beginning of the 21 st century could be characterized by the externalization of attention, following the externalization of our other faculties: the term \\\"exo-attention\\\" can be used to refer to the increasing number of electrical devices performing attentional tasks for us outside of our bodies.

Consequently, efforts to better understand perfectionism have potential transdiagnostic impact. One mechanism proposed to underlie perfectionism is an attention bias towards information signalling threats to perfectionism whereby people with elevated perfectionism selectively attend to threatening stimuli. Method: The present study assessed whether two core dimensions of perfectionism, perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns, are characterised by a threat-related attention bias, and whether this bias was characterised by attention being more rapidly captured by the stimuli (engagement bias), or of greater difficulty to disengage attention (disengagement bias). Participants (N = 108) completed measures of perfectionistic strivings and concerns, and symptoms of psychological distress before completing a modified dot-probe task to measure attention biases. Attention bias index scores were calculated across three factors: engagement bias vs disengagement bias, perfectionism relevant vs irrelevant stimuli, and negative vs positive emotional stimuli. Results: Overall, perfectionistic concerns were associated with a disengagement bias for negative stimuli, regardless of whether stimuli were perfectionism relevant or not. No other significant main or interaction effects were observed. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional in design, and no temporal or causal inferences could be made. Additionally, participants were from a community sample and therefore replication is required in clinical populations. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that individuals higher in perfectionistic concerns experience difficulty withdrawing their attention from emotionally negative stimuli. These findings contribute new information to our theoretical understandings of perfectionism and provide support for the cognitive-behavioural model of perfectionism.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences; Science & Technology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine; Psychology; Clinical; Psychiatry; Perfectionism; Perfectionistic strivings; Perfectionistic concerns; Attention bias; Engagement; Disengagement; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ANXIETY; THREAT; SELF\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences; Science & Technology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine; Psychology; Clinical; Psychiatry; Perfectionism; Perfectionistic strivings; Perfectionistic concerns; Attention bias; Engagement; Disengagement; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ANXIETY; THREAT; SELF\",\"authors\":\"Tonta, Kate; Howell, Joel; Hasking, Penelope; Boyes, Mark; Clarke, Patrick\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/20.500.11937\\/76059\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"052e7bc69c0b0b11fe78fc9fc722cfaaeb83cbd0d9024a3127cbe64e63701e0c\",\"relevance\":8,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"07573c04b67be0a1fbd9c5283d36b9b57f92b18ccdfe7dc4f343e0d8995a431f\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/research.gold.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/27111\\/1\\/fpsyg-09-01943.pdf; Mercure, Evelyne <http:\\/\\/research.gold.ac.uk\\/view\\/goldsmiths\\/Mercure=3AEvelyne=3A=3A.html>; Quiroz, Isabel; Goldberg, Laura; Bowden-Howl, Harriet; Coulson, Kimberley; Gliga, Teodora; Filippi, Roberto; Bright, Peter; Johnson, Mark H. and MacSweeney, Mair\\u00e9ad. 2018.

The present study addresses the impact of early language experience on attention to faces in infancy. It was hypothesized that infants learning two spoken languages (unimodal bilinguals) and hearing infants of Deaf mothers learning British Sign Language and spoken English (bimodal bilinguals) would show enhanced attention to faces compared to monolinguals. The comparison between unimodal and bimodal bilinguals allowed differentiation of the effects of learning two languages, from the effects of increased visual communication in hearing infants of Deaf mothers. Data are presented for two independent samples of infants: Sample 1 included 49 infants between 7 and 10 months (26 monolinguals and 23 unimodal bilinguals), and Sample 2 included 87 infants between 4 and 8 months (32 monolinguals, 25 unimodal bilinguals, and 30 bimodal bilingual infants with a Deaf mother). Eye-tracking was used to analyze infants\\u2019 visual scanning of complex arrays including a face and four other stimulus categories. Infants from 4 to 10 months (all groups combined) directed their attention to faces faster than to non-face stimuli (i.e., attention capture), directed more fixations to, and looked longer at faces than non-face stimuli (i.e., attention maintenance). Unimodal bilinguals demonstrated increased attention capture and attention maintenance by faces compared to monolinguals. Contrary to predictions, bimodal bilinguals did not differ from monolinguals in attention capture and maintenance by face stimuli.

In dual-tasks, central attention is required to select the appropriate response, but because central attention is limited in capacity, response selection can only be carried out for one task at a time. In auditory search tasks, search time to detect the target sound increases with the number of distractor sounds added to the auditory scene (set sizes), indicating that auditory attention is limited in capacity. Here, we investigated whether central and auditory attention relied on common or distinct capacity limitations using a dual-task paradigm. In two experiments, participants completed a visual choice discrimination task (task 1) together with an auditory search task (task 2), and the two tasks were separated by an experimentally modulated stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Analysing auditory search time as a function of SOA and set sizes (locus-of-slack method) revealed that the auditory search process in task 2 was performed after response selection in a visual two-choice discrimination task 1 (Experiment 1), but concurrently with response selection in a visual four-choice discrimination task 1 (Experiment 2). Hence, although response selection in the visual four-choice discrimination task demanded more central attention as compared with response selection in the two-choice discrimination task, the auditory search process was performed in parallel. Distribution analyses of inter-response time further indicated that parallel processing of response selection and auditory search was not influenced by response grouping. Taken together, the two experiments provided evidence that central and auditory attention relied on distinct capacity limitations.\",\"published_in\":\"QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY ; ISSN: 1747-0218 ; ISSN: 1747-0226\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences; Auditory attention; dual-task; psychological refractory period; locus-of-slack; DUAL-TASK INTERFERENCE; CHRONOMETRIC EVIDENCE; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; GUIDED SEARCH; EFFECT SIZE; CAPACITY; MODEL; LOCALIZATION\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences; Auditory attention; dual-task; psychological refractory period; locus-of-slack; DUAL-TASK INTERFERENCE; CHRONOMETRIC EVIDENCE; SPATIAL ATTENTION;  GUIDED SEARCH; EFFECT SIZE; CAPACITY; MODEL; LOCALIZATION\",\"authors\":\"Kattner, Florian; Reimer, Christina\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8679380\",\"oa_state\":\"0\",\"url\":\"23c2c0ab6e47d73102ef5de4025849ed614df8d509d0d98586015d86eda86792\",\"relevance\":3,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"48276ba78a049f6bdad7d4a54d2e221b2cca8f4043cfdac89976e38607baab6f\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8644265; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1854\\/LU-8644265; http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s12369-020-00628-x; https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8644265\\/file\\/8644266\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8644265; http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/1854\\/LU-8644265; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s12369-020-00628-x; https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8644265\\/file\\/8644266\",\"title\":\"Analysis of attention in child-robot interaction among children diagnosed with cognitive impairment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Interacting with social robots has been reported as potentially beneficial for children with social communication difficulties, with one of the promising applications being the practising of social skills, such as joint attention. We present the analysis of attention skills in children with cognitive impairments over a series of child-robot interaction sessions. Here, an interaction consists of five different modules. The first module introduces the child to the robot. The next three modules are the task modules during which children are expected to improve their attention skills during the completion of a series of social tasks. The final module is a free style interaction, where the duration of interaction between the child and robot was used as a proxy to indicate the attention of the child towards a robot. Our analysis showed that the majority of the children reduced their task completion time in modules two to four, indicating an improvement in attention. Moreover, most of the children showed positive engagement towards the robot and spent an average of 120 s during the free style interaction in module five. The positive response suggests that the robot, via child-robot interaction could be a useful and engaging tool to improve attention skills of the children with cognitive impairment.\",\"published_in\":\"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS ; ISSN: 1875-4791 ; ISSN: 1875-4805\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Technology and Engineering; Social Sciences; Child-Robot Interaction; Children with cognitive impairment; Robotics; AUTISM; COMMUNICATION; CONTACT; AGENT\",\"subject\":\"Technology and Engineering; Social Sciences; Child-Robot Interaction; Children with cognitive impairment; Robotics; AUTISM; COMMUNICATION; CONTACT; AGENT\",\"authors\":\"Ismail, Luthffi; Hanapiah, Fazah Akhtar; Belpaeme, Tony; Dambre, Joni; wyffels, Francis\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/biblio.ugent.be\\/publication\\/8644265\",\"oa_state\":\"0\",\"url\":\"48276ba78a049f6bdad7d4a54d2e221b2cca8f4043cfdac89976e38607baab6f\",\"relevance\":2,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"29ed66ef2aafa150255099a709fa5efb88fe854b1044311983f5c9251829a78b\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/link.springer.com\\/article\\/10.1038\\/s41598-020-64297-6; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2045-2322; doi:10.1038\\/s41598-020-64297-6; 2045-2322; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b28148fafa6a4a38b6c110b30b838246\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/s41598-020-64297-6; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b28148fafa6a4a38b6c110b30b838246\",\"title\":\"Development of Social Attention and Oxytocin Levels in Maltreated Children\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Child maltreatment (CM) is a major risk factor for various psychopathologies but also adversely affects social development. Research on oxytocin (OT) is currently drawing attention as an endocrine basis for social development. In this study, we investigated the relationship between visual attention to social cues and salivary OT levels in children exposed to CM. The results revealed that the CM group had a significantly lower percentage of gaze fixation for the human face eye area and lower salivary OT levels compared to the typical development group. Moreover, a path analysis suggested that gaze fixation for the eye area was a mediator of the relationship between salivary OT levels and social-emotional problems in the CM group. These results suggest that lower endogenous OT levels in maltreated children may lead to atypical development of their visual attention to eyes as a social cue, resulting in social-emotional problems.\",\"published_in\":\"Scientific Reports, Vol 10, Iss 1, Pp 1-10 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"subject\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"authors\":\"Shizuka Suzuki; Takashi X.

Methods Using a classical twin design, the current study investigated the genetic contribution to individual variation in social and non-social attention abilities, and further probed their potential genetic linkage. Moreover, individual autistic traits were further measured in an independent group of non-twin participants to examine the hypothetical link between the core social attention ability and ASD. Results We found reliable genetic influences on the social attentional effects induced by two distinct cues (eye gaze and walking direction), with 91% of their covariance accounted for by common genetic effects. However, no evidence of heritability or shared genetic effects was observed for the attentional effect directed by a non-social cue (i.e. arrow direction) and its correlation with the social attention ability. Remarkably, one's autistic traits could well predict his\\/her heritable core social attention ability extracted from the conventional social attentional effect. Conclusions These findings together suggest that human social attention ability is supported by unique genetic mechanisms that can be shared across different social, but not non-social, processing. Moreover, they also encourage the identification of 'social attention genes' and highlight the critical role of the core human social attention ability in seeking the endophenotypes of social cognitive disorders including ASD.

Adolescents' attention-seeking motives were examined as a mediator of these over-time associations. In line with this model's account of self-image failure, we also expected that narcissistic youth's attention-seeking should increase following experiences of ego threat, such as social rejection. These hypotheses were tested with two waves of self-report data, spaced one year apart, among 307 adolescents aged 12\\u201315 at T1 (Mage = 12.87, SD = 0.75). In line with predictions, earlier adolescent narcissism predicted later social media disclosure, problematic use, and smartphone stress, via increased attention-seeking. Furthermore, a significant interaction between narcissism and perceived social rejection at T1 predicted adolescents' outcomes at T2, via attention-seeking; Participants with a combination of higher narcissism and higher rejection at T1 reported higher levels of attention-seeking at T2. These longitudinal results suggest that narcissistic adolescents' attention-seeking on social media, particularly as a way to recover from social rejection, might backfire and ultimately contribute to an ongoing pattern of self-defeating behavior.

Social attention is atypical in autism. However, the majority of evidence for this claim comes from studies where the social partner is not physically present and the participants are children. Consequently, to ensure acquisition of a comprehensive overview of social attention in autism, systematic analysis of factors known to influence face-to-face social attention in neurotypicals is necessary and evidence from adulthood is required. This study assessed the influence of experimenter gaze direction (direct or averted) and conversational phase (speaking or listening) on social attention during a face-to-face conversation. Eye-tracking analyses indicated that when the experimenter looked directly at the participant, autistic adults looked at the experimenter's face less than did neurotypical adults. However, this between-group difference was significantly reduced when the experimenter's gaze was averted. Therefore, opportunities for reciprocal social gaze are missed by autistic adults when the social partner makes direct eye contact. A greater proportion of time was spent fixating the experimenter's eye region when participants were speaking compared to listening in both neurotypical and autistic adults. Overall, this study provides a rich picture of the nature of social attention in face-to-face conversations adopted by autistic adults and demonstrates individual variation in social attention styles.

The role of social attention in associations between empathy and aggression has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, indicators of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, social attention, and aggression were simultaneously assessed in children aged 45 months. A total of 61 mother-child dyads participated in a lab visit, during which maternal reports of aggression were obtained. Children watched three clips showing a sad, scared, and happy child, respectively, and a neutral social clip while heart rate was recorded. Heart rate change from nonsocial baseline clips to emotional clips was calculated as an index of affective empathy. Questions about the emotions of the children in the clips were asked to assess cognitive empathy. Social attention was defined as time spent looking at faces during the clips. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between affective empathy and aggression and between social attention and aggression. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that the association between affective empathy and aggression was moderated by social attention; the negative association between affective empathy and aggression was stronger in children with relatively reduced social attention. No association was found between cognitive empathy and aggression. Therefore, both affective empathy and social attention are important targets for early interventions that aim to prevent or reduce aggression. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This is a core ability as it permits to create pervasive relationships among individuals and with the environment around them. In the beginning, this form of social orienting was considered a reflexive phenomenon, but in recent years evidence has shown that it is also permeable to several social factors related to the observer, the individual depicted in the cueing face, and the relationship between them. The major goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview concerning the role that social variables can play in shaping covert gaze cueing in healthy adults, critically examining both the modulatory social factors for which evidence is more robust and those for which evidence is mixed. When available, overt attention studies will also be discussed. Finally, a novel theoretical framework linking these social and attention domains will be also introduced.

This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other\\u2019s mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.

Altered emotion-attention interactions have been associated with symptoms of affective disturbances, and emerging research focuses on improving emotion-attention interactions to prevent or treat affective disorders. In line with the Human Affectome Project's emphasis on linguistic components, we also analyzed the language used to describe attention-related aspects of emotion, and highlighted terms related to domains such as conscious awareness, motivational effects of attention, social attention, and emotion regulation. These terms were discussed within a broader review of available evidence regarding the neural correlates of (1) Emotion-Attention Interactions in Perception, (2) Emotion-Attention Interactions in Learning and Memory, (3) Individual Differences in Emotion-Attention Interactions, and (4) Training and Interventions to Optimize Emotion-Attention Interactions.

Multisensory and dynamic events have been shown to elicit more attention and produce greater sustained attention in infants than auditory or visual events alone. Such redundant and often temporally synchronous information guides selectivity and facilitates perception, learning, and memory of properties of events specified by redundancy. In addition, events involving faces or other social stimuli provide an extraordinary amount of redundant information that attracts and sustains attention. In the current study, 4- and 8-month-old infants were shown 2-min multimodal videos featuring social or nonsocial stimuli to determine the relative roles of synchrony and stimulus category in inducing attention. Behavioral measures included average looking time and peak look duration, and convergent measurement of heart rate (HR) allowed for the calculation of HR-defined phases of attention: Orienting (OR), sustained attention (SA), and attention termination (AT). The synchronous condition produced an earlier onset of SA (less time in OR) and a deeper state of SA than the asynchronous condition. Social stimuli attracted and held attention (longer duration of peak looks and lower HR than nonsocial stimuli). Effects of synchrony and the social nature of stimuli were additive, suggesting independence of their influence on attention. These findings are the first to demonstrate different HR-defined phases of attention as a function of intersensory redundancy, suggesting greater salience and deeper processing of naturalistic synchronous audiovisual events compared with asynchronous ones.

Methods Using a classical twin design, the current study investigated the genetic contribution to individual variation in social and non-social attention abilities, and further probed their potential genetic linkage. Moreover, individual autistic traits were further measured in an independent group of non-twin participants to examine the hypothetical link between the core social attention ability and ASD. Results We found reliable genetic influences on the social attentional effects induced by two distinct cues (eye gaze and walking direction), with 91% of their covariance accounted for by common genetic effects. However, no evidence of heritability or shared genetic effects was observed for the attentional effect directed by a non-social cue (i.e. arrow direction) and its correlation with the social attention ability. Remarkably, one's autistic traits could well predict his\\/her heritable core social attention ability extracted from the conventional social attentional effect. Conclusions These findings together suggest that human social attention ability is supported by unique genetic mechanisms that can be shared across different social, but not non-social, processing. Moreover, they also encourage the identification of \\u2018social attention genes\\u2019 and highlight the critical role of the core human social attention ability in seeking the endophenotypes of social cognitive disorders including ASD.

Early word learning emerges in the context of tightly coupled social interactions between the early learner and a mature partner. In the present study, we develop and apply a novel paradigm-dual head-mounted eye tracking-to record momentary gaze data from both parents and infants during free-flowing toy-play contexts. With fine-grained sequential patterns extracted from continuous gaze streams, we objectively measure both joint attention and sustained attention as parents and 9-month-old infants played with objects and as parents named objects during play. We show that both joint attention and infant sustained attention predicted vocabulary sizes at 12 and 15 months, but infant sustained attention in the context of joint attention, not joint attention itself, is the stronger unique predictor of later vocabulary size. Joint attention may predict word learning because joint attention supports infant attention to the named object.

The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record ; Coordinating actions with others is crucial for our survival. Our ability to see what others are seeing and to align our visual attention with them facilitates these joint actions. In the present research, we set out to increase our understanding of such joint attention by investigating the extent to which social information would be able to prioritize overt (when moving the eyes to attend) and covert (when shifting attention without eye movements) attention in a joint spatial cueing task. Participants saw a cue and detected a target at the same or a different location alongside an unseen partner of either higher or lower social rank. In a novel twist, participants were led to believe that the cue was connected to the gaze location of their partner. In Experiment 1, where participants were told to not move their eyes (covert attention), the partner's social rank did not change how quickly participants detected targets. But in Experiment 2, where participants were free to move their eyes naturally (overt attention), inhibition of return effects (slower responses to cued than uncued targets) were modulated by their partner's social rank. These social top-down effects occurred already at a short SOA of 150 ms. Our findings suggest that overt attention might provide a key tool for joint action, as it is penetrable for social information at the early stages of information processing. ; SAGE Junior Research Fellowship.

These networks can be modulated by different contextual and relational situations. Aim of this review is to explain how a combination of natural and social stimuli can positively affect the attentional processes. It has been proposed that the exposition to natural environment can positively affect direct attention, a common resource supporting both executive functioning and self-regulation processes in cognition. It has been suggested that the decrease of the effort required to voluntary control attention from the bottom upwards could determine some internal reflection that may support creative thinking secondarily to a simultaneous reduction in the effort required to orient attention between thoughts and impressions. In my view, not only exposition to natural and green environment improves attentional processes but also the involvement in social relationship. The development of the orientation and inhibitory control networks is sensitive to the social nature of the stimuli, for instance, in a task, including socially relevant stimuli the efficiency of these two attentional networks increases in children, in adults and in elderly subjects. Social attention, starting very early in the life (joint attention) is a very important mechanism for the regulation of social relationships. A key for a better development of cognitive functions such as attentional processes is the promotion of the immersion in the natural environment and the involvement in social relationship. natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships  Federico, Francesca\"},{\"id\":\"907f3ded4cbd1174d56305a3fd75947e896c8a1492016bef1f7769fc36dffa29\",\"content\":\"Indicators of affective empathy, cognitive empathy and social attention during emotional clips in relation to aggression in three-year-olds Research indicates that impaired empathy is a risk factor of aggression and that social attention is important for empathy. The role of social attention in associations between empathy and aggression has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, indicators of affective empathy, cognitive empathy, social attention, and aggression were simultaneously assessed in children aged 45 months. A total of 61 mother\\u2013child dyads participated in a lab visit, during which maternal reports of aggression were obtained. Children watched three clips showing a sad, scared, and happy child, respectively, and a neutral social clip while heart rate was recorded. Heart rate change from nonsocial baseline clips to emotional clips was calculated as an index of affective empathy. Questions about the emotions of the children in the clips were asked to assess cognitive empathy. Social attention was defined as time spent looking at faces during the clips. Correlation analyses revealed negative associations between affective empathy and aggression and between social attention and aggression. Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that the association between affective empathy and aggression was moderated by social attention; the negative association between affective empathy and aggression was stronger in children with relatively reduced social attention. No association was found between cognitive empathy and aggression. Therefore, both affective empathy and social attention are important targets for early interventions that aim to prevent or reduce aggression.   Noten, M.M.P.G.; Van der Heijden, K.

Although training for top-down attentional control has been an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder, few studies have demonstrated that individuals with social anxiety have top-down attentional dysfunction. This study used dichotic listening (DL) tasks to investigate the relationship between social anxiety and top-down attentional control over relevant brain activities. We also investigated relationships between both social situation-dependent self-focused attention and external attention bias and situation-independent attentional control. Thirty-six healthy participants underwent near-infrared spectroscopy scanning while performing top-down selective and divided attention DL tasks. Then, they undertook a speech task and completed a questionnaire to assess the degrees of their self-focused attention and external attention bias. The results showed that the degree of social fear and self-focused attention during the speech task were negatively correlated with scores on the selective attention task and with the activity of the left pars opercularis during the selective DL task, which were related to each other. These results suggest that a relationship exists between social fear, self-focused attention in a social situation, and top-down selective attentional dysfunction as assessed both behaviorally and by brain activity changes.

The concept of directed social learning predicts that social learning opportunities for an individual will depend on social dynamics, context and demonstrator identity. However, few empirical studies have examined social attention biases in animal groups. Sex-based and kinship-based biases in social learning and social attention towards females have been shown in a despotic and female philopatric primate: the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The present study examined social attention during the juvenile period. Social attention was recorded through 5-min focal observations during periods of natural foraging. Kin emerged as the most important focus of social attention in juveniles, intensified by biased spatial proximity towards matrilineal related members. The highest-ranking conspecifics were more frequently observed by juveniles than low-ranking ones. Additionally, younger and orphaned juveniles showed higher levels of social attention overall, compared to other age categories. No effect of the juvenile's hierarchical rank was detected, suggesting that the variation in social attention recorded reflects different biases and stages of social learning and socialisation, rather than social anxiety. Juvenile females tended to exhibit a dominance-based bias more strongly than did males. This might be explained by a greater emphasis on attaining social knowledge during juvenile socialisation in the philopatric sex. Moreover, despite a preferred association between juveniles, social attention was more often directed to adults, suggesting that adults may still be more often chosen as a target of attention independent of their dominance rank.

However, individuals differ with respect to eye gaze behaviors such as frequency of eye-to-eye contacts, and these variations may reflect underlying differences in social behavior in the population. While the use of eye signaling to indicate a shared object of attention in joint attention tasks has been well-studied, the effects of the natural variation in establishing eye contact during joint attention have not been isolated. Here, we investigate this question using a novel two-person joint attention task. Participants were not instructed regarding the use of eye contacts; thus all mutual eye contact events between interacting partners that occurred during the joint attention task were spontaneous and varied with respect to frequency. We predicted that joint attention systems would be modulated by differences in the social behavior across participant pairs, which could be measured by the frequency of eye contact behavior. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning and eye-tracking to measure the neural signals associated with joint attention in interacting dyads and to record the number of eye contact events between them. Participants engaged in a social joint attention task in which real partners used eye gaze to direct each other\\u2019s attention to specific targets. Findings were compared to a non-social joint attention task in which an LED cue directed both partners\\u2019 attention to the same target. The social joint attention condition showed greater activity in right temporoparietal junction than the non-social condition, replicating prior joint attention results. Eye-contact frequency modulated the joint attention activity, revealing bilateral activity in social and high level visual areas associated with partners who made more eye contact. Additionally, when the number of mutual eye contact events was used to classify each pair as either \\u201chigh eye contact\\u201d or \\u201clow eye contact\\u201d dyads, cross-brain coherence analysis revealed greater coherence between high eye contact dyads than low eye contact dyads in these same areas.

This study examined early attention in infant siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are at risk for social and communication delays. Visual and auditory attention was mapped from age 1 week to 5 months in infants at familial risk for ASD (high risk; N = 41) and low-risk typically developing infants (low risk; N = 39). At 12 months, a subset of participants ( N = 40) was administered assessments of social communication and nonverbal cognitive skills. Results revealed that high-risk infants performed lower on attention tasks at 2 and 3 months of age compared to low-risk infants. A significant association between overall attention at 3 months and developmental outcome at 12 months was observed for both groups. These results provide evidence for early vulnerabilities in visual attention for infants at risk for ASD during a period of important neurodevelopmental transition (between 2 and 3 months) when attention has significant implications for social communication and cognitive development.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a psychiatric condition that often onsets in childhood. Cognitive models underline the role of attention in the maintenance of SAD, but studies on youth populations are few, particularly those using eye tracking to measure attention. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD includes interventions targeting attention, like exposure to eye contact, but the link between CBT and attention bias is largely unexplored. This study investigated attention bias in youth with SAD and the association with outcome from CBT. Latency to attend to pictures of faces with different emotions (vigilance) and latency to disengage from social stimuli (avoidance) was examined in N = 25 adolescents (aged 13-17) with SAD in relation to treatment outcome. Vigilance was operationalized as the time it took to relocate the gaze from a central position to a peripherally appearing social stimulus. The latency to disengage from a centrally located social stimulus, when a non-social stimulus appeared in the periphery, was used as a proxy for avoidance.

Cognitive models underline the role of attention in the maintenance of SAD, but studies on youth populations are few, particularly those using eye tracking to measure attention. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for SAD includes interventions targeting attention, like exposure to eye contact, but the link between CBT and attention bias is largely unexplored. This study investigated attention bias in youth with SAD and the association with outcome from CBT. Latency to attend to pictures of faces with different emotions (vigilance) and latency to disengage from social stimuli (avoidance) was examined in N = 25 adolescents (aged 13-17) with SAD in relation to treatment outcome. Vigilance was operationalized as the time it took to relocate the gaze from a central position to a peripherally appearing social stimulus. The latency to disengage from a centrally located social stimulus, when a non-social stimulus appeared in the periphery, was used as a proxy for avoidance. Attention characteristics in the SAD group were compared to non-anxious (NA) controls (N = 22). Visual attention was measured using eye tracking. Participants in both the SAD and NA groups were vigilant towards angry faces, compared to neutral and happy faces. Similarly, both groups disengaged attention faster from angry faces.

Attention is one of the most important cognitive functions which is impaired in children with ADHD that can affect the future educational, social and occupational functions of these children. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of attention training on attentional functions in children with ADHD. Materials and Methods The method of this study was semi- experimental with purposive sampling with pre-test and post-test for control group. For this aim, 40 male students were diagnosed as ADHD who were selected by clinical interview and Conner's questionnaire and randomly 20 participants were assigned in the experimental group and 20 were assigned in the control group. In order to measure the variables of the research, Stroop task, continuous performance test, Wisconsin Card Sorting test, and divided attention test were used. Attention training was presented on the experimental group in 8 sessions, using a set of related cognitive games and attention-based task .For data analysis, covariance analysis was used. Results The results indicated that attention training significantly increased the sustained attention performance and response inhibition of children with ADHD, but there was no significant effect on the selective attention function, shifting attention and divided attention. Conclusion According to the findings, the present training package can be used to improve sustained attention and response inhibition in children with ADHD. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; attention; cognition; Medicine; R; Medicine (General); R5-920 Majallah-i D\\u0101nishkadah-i \\u0312ul\\u016bm-i Pizishk\\u012b-i Niysh\\u0101b\\u016br, Vol 7, Iss 4, Pp 89-103 (2019) Nahid Nikpour; S.

This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other\\u2019s mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.

Previous research has suggested that when a social partner, such as a parent, pays attention to an object, this increases the attention that infants pay to that object during spontaneous, naturalistic play. There are two contrasting reasons why this might be: first, social context may influence increases in infants\\u2019 endogenous (voluntary) attention control; second, social settings may offer increased opportunities for exogenous attentional capture. To differentiate these possibilities, we compared 12-month-old infants\\u2019 naturalistic attention patterns in two settings: Solo Play and Joint Play with a social partner (the parent). Consistent with previous research we found that infants\\u2019 look durations toward play objects were longer during Joint Play, and that moments of inattentiveness were fewer, and shorter. Follow-up analyses, conducted to differentiate the two above-proposed hypotheses, were more consistent with the latter hypothesis. We found that infants\\u2019 rate of change of attentiveness was faster during Joint Play than Solo Play, suggesting that internal attention factors, such as attentional inertia, may influence looking behaviour less during Joint Play. We also found that adults\\u2019 attention forwards-predicted infants\\u2019 subsequent attention more than vice versa, suggesting that adults\\u2019 behaviour may drive infants\\u2019 behaviour. Finally, we found that mutual gaze did not directly facilitate infant attentiveness. Overall, our results suggest that infants spend more time attending to objects during Joint Play than Solo Play, but that these differences are more likely attributable to increased exogenous attentional scaffolding from the parent during social play, rather than to increased endogenous attention control from the infant.

It is shown that the ability to establish joint attention based on the direction of the interlocutor's gaze is a precursor of the emergence of social and cognitive abilities. The study examined the differences between typical developmental children and atypical development control groups in their ability to be sensitive to social behavioral signals, namely the orientation direction of the interlocutor's gaze. On a sample of 120 children with typical development, mental retardation, hearing impairment, speech disorders and visual impairment, a number of tasks were developed to assess the ability to use the character's direction of sight in the picture to determine its intentions. The task measured such a skill of joint attention as the child\\u2019s ability to calculate and report what the other person was looking at and what he intended to choose. We also used tasks with a central hint with an explicit indication of an arrow and a peripheral hint to check the recognition of social and non-social orienting signals. Based on the comparison of contrasting groups, the variability of the formation and age-related changes in skills of joint attention, or rather the presence of differences in recognition, synthesis and interpretation orienting social information coming from eye contact. It was found that children with atpic development have a low level of \\\"downward\\\" joint attention. Impaired joint attention may be one of the earliest signs in children with atypical development at a later age. The results showed that deficiencies in the behavior of joint attention vary depending on mental age and level of development, a sensory defect, so the level of development can really affect the ability of children to joint attention. attention; joint attention; social cognition; age-related development; preschool age; theory of mind; mental model; mental retardation; autism; Education; L Psihologo-Pedagogi\\u010deskie Issledovani\\u00e2, Vol 12, Iss 1, Pp 105-121 (2020) Smirnova Ya.K.\"},{\"id\":\"a5d6f1814d370210d76f77c88df8fcc8a8f244d53b44df2ee4c0b7a3a1d730f1\",\"content\":\"Neural correlates of emotion-attention interactions : from perception, learning, and memory to social cognition, individual differences, and training interventions Due to their ability to capture attention, emotional stimuli tend to benefit from enhanced perceptual processing, which can be helpful when such stimuli are task-relevant but hindering when they are task-irrelevant. Altered emotion-attention interactions have been associated with symptoms of affective disturbances, and emerging research focuses on improving emotion-attention interactions to prevent or treat affective disorders. In line with the Human Affectome Project's emphasis on linguistic components, we also analyzed the language used to describe attention-related aspects of emotion, and highlighted terms related to domains such as conscious awareness, motivational effects of attention, social attention, and emotion regulation. These terms were discussed within a broader review of available evidence regarding the neural correlates of (1) Emotion-Attention Interactions in Perception, (2) Emotion-Attention Interactions in Learning and Memory, (3) Individual Differences in Emotion-Attention Interactions, and (4) Training and Interventions to Optimize Emotion-Attention Interactions. This comprehensive approach enabled an integrative overview of the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of emotion-attention interactions at multiple levels of analysis, and identification of emerging directions for future investigations.

In this point of view, I review the development of the attention-based view and its use in research on CHQs in MNCs. Developing a better understanding of the dynamics of attention between the different subsidiaries and the increasingly dispersed and disaggregated headquarters activities in MNCs requires a more dynamic view of attention.

This study aimed to know the correlation of emotion regulation and parental attention to social problem solving of boarding school adolescents. The research subjects were 65 students of SMAN CMBBS who were selected by simple random sampling method. The instruments used are social problem-solving scale, emotion regulation scale, and parental attention scale. Data were analyzed by multiple regression analysis. The results showed that there was a significant correlation between emotion regulation and parental attention with social problem solving for SMAN CMBBS adolescents, with p = 0.00 (R = 0.699). Partial correlation test proves that there is a significant correlation between emotional regulation and social problem solving for SMAN CMBBS adolescents (p = 0.00; rx1y = 0.549). Partial correlation also proves that there is a significant relationship of parental attention to social problem solving for adolescent CMBBS (p = 0.032; rx2y = 0.268). This study concludes that there is a significant correlation between emotion regulation and parental attention to social problem solving of SMAN CMBBS adolescents.

The present review draws together studies that have measured the orienting of attention, following observation of another\\u2019s goal-directed action. Our review proposes that, in line with the literature on eye gaze, action is a particularly strong orienting cue for the visual system. However, we additionally suggest that action may orient visual attention using mechanisms, which gaze direction does not (i.e., neural direct mapping and corepresentation). Finally, we review the implications of these gaze-independent mechanisms for the study of attention to action. We suggest that our understanding of attention to action may benefit from being studied in the context of joint action paradigms, where the role of higher level action goals and social factors can be investigated.

Typically, this bias has been conceptualized as driven by an overactive bottom-up attentional system; however, this potentially overlooks the role of top-down attention in being able to modulate this bottom-up bias. Here, the role of top-down mechanisms in directing attention toward emotional faces was assessed with a modified dot-probe task, in which participants were given a top-down cue (\\\"happy\\\" or \\\"angry\\\") to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial, and the cued face was either presented with a face of the other emotion (angry, happy) or a neutral face. This study found that social anxiety was not associated with differences in shifting attention toward cued angry faces. However, participants with higher levels of social anxiety were selectively impaired in attentional shifting toward a cued happy face when it was paired with an angry face, but not when paired with a neutral face. The results indicate that top-down attention can be used to orient attention to emotional faces, but that higher levels of social anxiety are associated with selective deficits in top-down control of attention in the presence of threat.

Attention bias modification (ABM) is a potential intervention in relieving social anxiety symptoms, while its underlying neural mechanisms are not yet understood. The current study included 63 college students with social anxiety. Participants were assigned to the attention modification program (AMP, n = 20), the attention control condition (ACC, n = 20) and the passive waiting group (PW, n = 23). Questionnaires and the emotional Stroop task with EEG recordings were used to assess whether and how the 4-week ABM period affected emotional symptoms and specific emotional processing. Results showed that the two training groups (AMP and ACC) produced comparable emotional improvements and both showed a decrease in negative bias compared with the PW group. The ERP results indicated that despite no significant ERP changes in the PW group, the ACC group exhibited a greater N1, whereas the AMP group exhibited a reduced VPP at the post-test stage compared to the pre-test stage. Besides, both training groups showed a similar late positive potential (LPP) reduction. Notably, the reduction in LPP was positively correlated with behavioral and symptom improvement. Thus, manipulations unique to ABM (face-target contingency) primarily modulate the early attention distribution of material-related stimuli. However, the clinical benefits of attention training may be due to later cognitive-affective mechanisms.

Relating gender differences in cognitive attention networks to digital distraction In response to increasing concerns about digital distraction, we bridged people's cognitive attention to digital distraction within the personal learning environment (PLE). Gender differences were investigated in college students' media-related perceived attention problems (PAP) and their attention self-regulatory strategies (SRS). Also examined were the gender moderating effects on the correlations of attention problems and regulatory strategies with six dimensions of social media usage and four cognitive- and adjustment-related criteria: online search strategies, media-multitasking self-efficacy (MMSE), positive\\/negative self-esteems, and academic achievement. Participants were 771 undergraduate and graduate students from 10 universities in Taiwan. Gender measurement invariance was established in the research instrument. Males exhibited higher PAP than females. Females demonstrated more versatile strategy use to regulate their attention with increased social media use, while males applied more behavioral strategies over social media use as disorientation increased during online searches. Higher MMSE was associated with higher executive and orienting problems for females, and higher alerting problems for males. Higher orienting problems was associated with more negative self-esteem for males. Females with higher PAP reported poorer academic achievement. Implications for practical intervention of PAPs are discussed for each gender group to promote college students' psychological well-being with regard to social media use and learning performance.

This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other\\u2019s mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.

Studies of joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder employ a variety of instrumentation, environments and occupations. From the occupational therapy perspective, current literature lacks a rigorous analysis of the transactions of person, environment and occupation embedded within the procedures of these studies. The goal of this scoping review was to investigate how these components transact to affect occupational performance. Method Using the Person\\u2013Environment\\u2013Occupation model as an evaluative lens, a scoping review was completed to summarize person, environment and occupation transactions in studies examining joint attention in children aged 6\\u201312 years with autism spectrum disorder. Results Six studies were included. Findings indicated that simplified social environments and demonstrations of joint attention promoted higher joint attention performance in children with autism spectrum disorder, at the cost of ecological validity. Maintaining ecological validity in complex social environments resulted in lower joint attention performance. Conclusion The Person\\u2013Environment\\u2013Occupation model can be used to develop an occupational therapy perspective on literature from outside the discipline. There is a relationship between the person, environment, occupation transactions and joint attention in children with autism spectrum disorder.

However, in practice it can be difficult to be heard in these crowded digital spaces. This study takes a strategic network perspective and draws from recent research in network science to propose the network contingency model of public attention. This model argues that in the networked social-mediated environment, an organization\\u2019s ability to attract public attention on social media is contingent on its ability to fit its network position with the network structure of the communication context. To test the model, we combine data mining, social network analysis, and machine-learning techniques to analyze a large-scale Twitter discussion network. The results of our analysis of Twitter discussion around the refugee crisis in 2016 suggest that in high core-periphery network contexts, \\u201cstar\\u201d positions were most influential whereas in low core-periphery network contexts, a \\u201ccommunity\\u201d strategy is crucial to attracting public attention. network analysis; big data; public attention  Saffer, Adam J\"},{\"id\":\"b6222e10a85b25b8c18a8ab3732d78ce15806948fe1cb583a62b03e096e5f0d2\",\"content\":\"Loneliness Modulates Automatic Attention to Warm and Competent Faces: Preliminary Evidence From an Eye-Tracking Study Social connections are essential for human survival. Loneliness is a motivational factor for building and maintaining social connections. Automatic attention occurs with little cognitive effort and plays a key role in detecting biologically salient events, such as human faces. Although previous studies have investigated the effect of loneliness on social behavior, the effect of loneliness on automatic attention to human faces remains largely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of loneliness on automatic visual attention to warmth and competence facial information, which determines facial attraction. This study included 43 participants who rated warmth and competence facial information. Then, they engaged with the target-distractor paradigm in which they saw two house images at the top and bottom and indicated whether the images were identical. During the task, we presented two faces as distractors and measured visual attention toward the faces as automatic attention because participants did not have to attend to the faces. The results showed an interactive effect between subjective loneliness and facial information on automatic attention. Warm targets automatically captured the attention of people feeling relatively lonely, whereas competent targets automatically captured the attention of those who felt less lonely. These results suggest that loneliness adaptively influences automatic processing of social information. automatic attention; competence; loneliness; social cognition; warmth; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 10 (2020) Toshiki Saito; Kosuke Motoki; Rui Nouchi; Ryuta Kawashima; Motoaki Sugiura\"},{\"id\":\"1a2706dd903b99c13ae88c50c1121c5982edd71da46c23dd4553deda6ff2fb8d\",\"content\":\"Human body motion captures visual attention and elicits pupillary dilation The social motivation theory proposes that individuals naturally orient their attention to the social world.

Adult learners often rely on a situational context to learn and understand a new word's meaning. Here, we explored whether interactive learning facilitates word learning by directing the learner's attention to a correct new word referent when a situational context is non-informative. We predicted larger involvement of inferior parietal, frontal, and visual cortices involved in visuo-spatial attention during interactive learning. We scanned participants while they played a visual word learning game with and without a social partner. As hypothesized, interactive learning enhanced activity in the right Supramarginal Gyrus when the situational context provided little information. Activity in the right Inferior Frontal Gyrus during interactive learning correlated with post-scanning behavioral test scores, while these scores correlated with activity in the Fusiform Gyrus in the non-interactive group. These results indicate that attention is involved in interactive learning when the situational context is minimal and suggest that individual learning processes may be largely different from interactive ones. As such, they challenge the ecological validity of what we know about individual learning and advocate the exploration of interactive learning in naturalistic settings.

Guided by the control of users' attention, the consumption figures for digital environments, mainly social media, show that addictive use is associated with multiple psychological, social, and physical development problems. The study presented develops a theoretical proposal regarding attention. In the first part, the research analyzes how attention has been studied and how it behaves using three disciplines: neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and economics. In the second part, considering this general framework, the study uses categories of the three disciplines to explain the functioning of social media, with special emphasis on their interactive, attractive, and addictive design. Finally, the article presents, as a practical example of the exposed theory, the main results of two case studies that describe social media consumption among young people. The research shows the relevance of the theoretical study of attention as a key element by which to understand the logics that dominate the interactive design of social media. It also uses a multidisciplinary perspective. The addictive behaviors identified in the two examples support the theoretical proposals and open research lines oriented to the measurement and understanding of the attention given to social media.

However, little is known about the influence of social anxiety on adolescents' brain and behavior. The present study investigated the neural basis of social anxiety using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and functional connectivity analysis. Then we investigated whether social anxiety is associated with attention bias. Furthermore, we investigated the neural basis of this association. Finally, longitudinal data was used to test if these biomarkers could predict social anxiety. The results indicated that social anxiety is positively associated with the grey matter volume (GMV) of orbital-frontal cortex (OFC), and the functional connectivity (FC) of OFC-amygdala. Mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between social anxiety and attention avoidance is partly mediated by the FC of OFC-amygdala. Finally, the present study demonstrated a close relationship between FC of the OFC-amygdala, the GMV of the OFC and the individual's social anxiety one year later. The present study suggested the aberrant structure of OFC and its connectivity with amygdala as the neural underpinning of social anxiety, which might serve as a compensatory mechanism to decrease attention avoidance and promote effective emotion regulation.

Fifty-two young, intelligent adults with ASD (IQrange = 88\\u2013130, Agerange = 18\\u201324) and 31 typically developing (TD) ASD (IQrange = 94\\u2013139, Agerange = 19\\u201328) gender matched controls participated and reported on severity of autism symptoms [Social Responsiveness Scale for Adults (SRS-A)]. Results showed no group difference in social attention, while autism symptom severity was related to decreased attention to faces across participants (r = \\u2212.32). Average SCL was lower in the ASD group, but no group difference in arousal reactivity (change from baseline to emotional phases) was detected. Lower SCL during video clips was related to autism symptom severity across participants (r = \\u2212.29). ASD individuals reported lower emotional awareness. We conclude that, even though no deviations in social attention or emotional reactivity were found in ASD, an overall lower level of social attention and arousal may help explain difficulties in social functioning in ASD. autism spectrum disorder; adulthood; social attention; emotional arousal; skin conductance level; symptom severity; Psychiatry; RC435-571 Frontiers in Psychiatry, Vol 10 (2019) Renee Dijkhuis; Emine Gurbuz; Tim Ziermans; Wouter Staal; Hanna Swaab\"},{\"id\":\"79d35a70611f4f63b2875cec4a52109f6285a3f3dad17bdc306a9b044a8ea176\",\"content\":\"Social media and social interaction to young people Abstract: The paper focuses on two key issues, social media and social interaction among students.

IMPROVING VISUAL ATTENTION TO SOCIAL STIMULI IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA Abstract Background Social dysfunction is a hallmark characteristic of schizophrenia, and individuals with this disorder often report difficulty navigating daily social interactions. Perceptual deficits, such as faulty visual attention to important aspects of social stimuli (i.e., failing to look at the most relevant portions of a stimulus), may be one mechanism by which social deficits arise. Faulty modulation of specific neural regions such as the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), may underlie visual attention abnormalities, and may act as suitable targets for neurostimulation. The current study utilizes neurostimulation to experimentally manipulate specific neural networks and determine whether stimulation 1) improves visual attention, 2) improves performance on social cognitive tasks, and 3) whether altered visual attention moderates this improved performance. Methods Using a double-blind crossover design, participants underwent both active and sham stimulation via tDCS approximately one week apart. Half of the participants received active and sham stimulation of rTPJ (n = 22), while the other half received active and sham stimulation of a comparator site within the social brain network (dmPFC, n = 23). After stimulation, visual attention was assessed through concurrent eye-tracking while participants complete several tasks of social cognition (emotion recognition: ER40, BLERT; Theory of Mind: TASIT). Visual attention was determined as the proportion of time spent attending to socially and contextually important AOIs. Results Data collection and data processing are still ongoing for this study, however planned interim analyses on a subset of the total sample (n = 45) indicate small to medium effects of active stimulation to the rTPJ compared to sham and dmPFC stimulation for both visual attention (\\u03b7p2=.035) and social cognitive performance on the BLERT task (\\u03b7p2=.067), specifically. These same effects are not seen in the other social cognitive tasks. Final analyses based on a sample size of 72 individuals are expected to be complete prior to presentation at SIRS 2020. Discussion This study is the first, to our knowledge, to target this neural region within schizophrenia for the purposes of improving visual attention and, subsequently, social cognition. Should the pattern of results from our interim analyses hold after completion of data collection, results indicate that active stimulation to the rTPJ has a unique impact on dynamic emotional stimuli, improving visual attention and accuracy in emotion recognition, suggesting a primary role of the rTPJ and visual attention in performance on this task. The intricate design of this study allows for thorough investigation of potential mechanisms by which social cognitive deficits develop, and the use of novel experimental techniques align with the theme of this year\\u2019s conference.

VIRTUAL REALITY SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING IMPROVES SOCIAL ATTENTION IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA Abstract Background Social impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia presenting a major barrier to recovery. Although antipsychotic medications can reduce psychotic symptoms, social impairments often persist, contributing to poor outcome. Validated interventions, such as Social Skills Training (Bellack et al., 2004), target a broad range of social domains but they yield only modest effect sizes for social outcome (Pfammatter et al, 2006). Moreover, conventional social interventions suffer from high burden on the clients and therapists, low adherence, lack of personalization, and low generalizability. Importantly, social interventions are not widely available. Virtual reality (VR) offers a viable alternative to conventional therapies with several advantages including high acceptability, an extensive repertoire of stimuli, low-burden, low-cost and safety (Strickland, 1997). Importantly, VR allows for a precise targeting of social cognitive mechanisms. Social attention, the fast orientation and allocation of resources to social stimuli can be indexed by tracking eye movements. Abnormal eye scanning behavior during social interactions has been linked to poor social functioning in schizophrenia (Brunet-Gouet & Decety, 2006). We designed a VR-based social skills training game to directly target social attention in schizophrenia. Methods Eighteen individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) participated in the VR training game twice a week for 5 weeks. Eye movement patterns were recorded throughout the training. Subjects were required to solve social \\u201cmissions\\u201d (e.g., obtain personal information through conversations with avatars) in different naturalistic scenarios. To start a mission, participants had to fixate on the chosen avatar. The latency to engage in a social interaction was indexed by the fixation time (social engagement latency). Each session consisted of 12 missions. We compared social engagement latency and eye gaze patterns pre- and post-training to assess the efficacy of the VR social skills training program. Results Social engagement latency significantly decreased after 10 sessions (d=0.78). This result suggests that prosocial attention benefitted from VR training. We also found that the standard deviation of dwell time (i.e., proportion of time spent looking at the avatar\\u2019s face during a conversation) significantly increased across training sessions (d=0.56). This result suggests an increased modulation of interpersonal engagement during social interaction. Additionally, participants\\u2019 emotion recognition ability significantly increased (\\u03b72 = 0.27), and negative symptoms significantly decreased (\\u03b72=0.34) from pre- to post- training. Importantly, these changes in social attention correlated with improvement in negative symptoms. Discussion Simulated and targeted social interactions with avatars in VR significantly improved social attention in individuals with schizophrenia. Importantly, improvements in negative symptoms and emotion perception after training suggest that this training protocol has an impact on a broad range of social functions. VR training is a promising alternative to traditional psychosocial interventions to target specific mechanisms underlying social functioning in schizophrenia.

This paper complements theoretical and methodological considerations regarding social media in critical discourse studies as it addresses social media content policies as a key contextual element. Specifically, this paper argues that - and why - the exploration of content policies and their enforcement is indispensable when approaching social media platforms and social media data in particular from a critical perspective. A number of researchers have already begun to identify contextual elements that require particular attention when viewing social media and social media data through a CDS lens. However, social media sites' content policies, as pervasive contextual element, have not received adequate research attention yet. Drawing on Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis (CMDA) and recent developments in Social Media CDS (SM-CDS), this paper first demonstrates the existing gap in research. Then, it contends that social media sites' content policies deserve more detailed attention in SM-CDS, argues why this is the case and elaborates on the different aspects of content policies and policy enforcement that require examination. After detailed theoretical discussion of this, empirical evidence to support this argument is presented in the form of a case study of Wikipedia and Wikipedia data. social media; CDS; SM-CDS; content policies; Wikipedia  Kopf, Susanne\"},{\"id\":\"315e0d63552f380c6084eae865e81102900ae4277a7c2461e6f6cdea482a5d71\",\"content\":\"Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder as Predictor for Social Adjustment amongStudents with Learning Disabilities in the Cycle One Schools in the Sultanate of Oman This study aimed to investigate the level of attention deficiency-hyperactivity & social adjustment among students with learning disabilities in the cycle one schools in South Batinah region as well as to verify the possibility of predicting social adjustment by knowing the level of attention deficiency & hyperactivity among these students.

These networks can be modulated by different contextual and relational situations. Aim of this review is to explain how a combination of natural and social stimuli can positively affect the attentional processes. It has been proposed that the exposition to natural environment can positively affect direct attention, a common resource supporting both executive functioning and self-regulation processes in cognition. It has been suggested that the decrease of the effort required to voluntary control attention from the bottom upwards could determine some internal reflection that may support creative thinking secondarily to a simultaneous reduction in the effort required to orient attention between thoughts and impressions. In my view, not only exposition to natural and green environment improves attentional processes but also the involvement in social relationship. The development of the orientation and inhibitory control networks is sensitive to the social nature of the stimuli, for instance, in a task, including socially relevant stimuli the efficiency of these two attentional networks increases in children, in adults and in elderly subjects. Social attention, starting very early in the life (joint attention) is a very important mechanism for the regulation of social relationships. A key for a better development of cognitive functions such as attentional processes is the promotion of the immersion in the natural environment and the involvement in social relationship. natural environment; attentional network development; social attention; stress; social relationships; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Francesca Federico\"},{\"id\":\"3ed614e640187494e80ec2b8c769d8cabb7faafedd9f81294aa64852baa08053\",\"content\":\"Neural correlates of negative expectancy and impaired social feedback processing in social anxiety Social anxiety has been associated with abnormalities in cognitive processing in the literature, manifesting as various cognitive biases. To what extent these biases interrupt social interactions remains largely unclear. This study used the Social Judgment Paradigm that could separate the expectation and experience stages of social feedback processing. Event-related potentials (ERPs) in these two stages were recorded to detect the effect of social anxiety that might not be reflected by behavioral data. Participants were divided into two groups according to their social anxiety level. Participants in the high social anxiety (HSA) group were more likely to predict that they would be socially rejected by peers than did their low social anxiety (LSA) counterparts (i.e. the control group). Compared to the ERP data of the LSA group, the HSA group showed: (a) a larger P1 component to social cues (peer faces) prior to social feedback presentation, possibly indicating an attention bias; (b) a difference in feedback-related negativity amplitude between unexpected social acceptance and unexpected social rejection, possibly indicating an expectancy bias; and (c) a diminished sensitivity of the P3 amplitude to social feedback valence (be accepted\\/be rejected), possibly indicating an experience bias.

An Eye Tracking Analysis BackgroundVisual atypicalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are a well documented phenomenon, beginning as early as 2\\u20136 months of age and manifesting in a significantly decreased attention to the eyes, direct gaze and socially salient information. Early emerging neurobiological deficits in perceiving social stimuli as rewarding or its active avoidance due to the anxiety it entails have been widely purported as potential reasons for this atypicality. Parallel research evidence also points to the significant benefits of animal presence for reducing social anxiety and enhancing social interaction in children with autism. While atypicality in social attention in ASD has been widely substantiated, whether this atypicality persists equally across species types or is confined to humans has not been a key focus of research insofar.MethodsWe attempted a comprehensive examination of the differences in visual attention to static images of human and animal faces (40 images; 20 human faces and 20 animal faces) among children with ASD using an eye tracking paradigm. 44 children (ASD n = 21; TD n = 23) participated in the study (10,362 valid observations) across five regions of interest (left eye, right eye, eye region, face and screen).ResultsResults obtained revealed significantly greater social attention across human and animal stimuli in typical controls when compared to children with ASD. However in children with ASD, a significantly greater attention allocation was seen to animal faces and eye region and lesser attention to the animal mouth when compared to human faces, indicative of a clear attentional preference to socially salient regions of animal stimuli. The positive attentional bias toward animals was also seen in terms of a significantly greater visual attention to direct gaze in animal images.ConclusionOur results suggest the possibility that atypicalities in social attention in ASD may not be uniform across species. It adds to the current neural and biomarker evidence base of the potentially greater social reward processing and lesser social anxiety underlying animal stimuli as compared to human stimuli in children with ASD. animals; autism (ASD); social attention; visual attention; eye tracking; human animal interaction (HAI); Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Georgitta J.

This non-verbal coordination of attention plays a fundamental role in our social lives: it ensures that we refer to the same object, develop a shared language, understand each other's mental states, and coordinate our actions. Models of joint attention generally attribute this accomplishment to gaze coordination. But are visual attentional mechanisms sufficient to achieve joint attention, in all cases? Besides cases where visual information is missing, we show how combining it with other senses can be helpful, and even necessary to certain uses of joint attention. We explain the two ways in which non-visual cues contribute to joint attention: either as enhancers, when they complement gaze and pointing gestures in order to coordinate joint attention on visible objects, or as modality pointers, when joint attention needs to be shifted away from the whole object to one of its properties, say weight or texture. This multisensory approach to joint attention has important implications for social robotics, clinical diagnostics, pedagogy and theoretical debates on the construction of a shared world.

Investigators have found that there is a continuum of autism-like traits in the general population, suggesting that these autistic traits may be examined in the absence of clinically diagnosed autism. To provide evidence for the continuum of autistic traits in terms of social attention and to provide insights into social attention deficits in people with autism, the current study was conducted to examine the effect of autistic traits of typically developing individuals on social orienting using a spatial cueing paradigm. The typically developing individuals who participated in this study were divided into high autistic traits (HA) and low autistic traits groups using the Autism Quotient scale. All participants completed a spatial cueing task in which social cues (gaze) and non-social cues (arrow) were presented under different cue predictability conditions (predictive vs. non-predictive) with different SOAs (100 ms vs. 400 ms). The results showed that compared to low autistic individuals, high autistic individuals had less benefit from non-predictive social cues but greater benefit from non-social ones, providing evidence that such spatial attention impairment in high autistic individuals is specific to the social domain. Interestingly, the smaller benefit from non-predictive social cues in high autistic individuals was shown only in the 400 ms condition, not in the 100 ms condition, suggesting that their difficulties in orienting to non-predictive social cues may be caused by a deficiency in spontaneously effortful control processing. autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits; attention orienting; social cues; non-social cues; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 11 (2020) Guoyao Lin; Yanling Cui; Jiajing Zeng; Liang Huang\"},{\"id\":\"8f1ec1f5c07d7598df916574b1ff18a606feca2aff9dd0b2b3e62bc4d6913b1c\",\"content\":\"The functional consequences of social attention on memory precision and on memory-guided orienting in development Adults are slower at locating targets in naturalistic scenes containing a social distractor compared to an equally salient non-social distractor, and their subsequent memory for targets in social scenes is poorer.

Six-to-ten year-old children and young adults took part in the current study, employing a combination of behavioural and eye-tracking measures. Social stimuli in naturalistic scenes distracted both children and adults during visual search, as demonstrated by their gaze behavior and search times. In addition, eye-tracking revealed even greater attentional capture by social distractors for children. Memory for targets was worse in social compared to non-social scenes. Intriguingly, children demonstrated overall better memory precision than adults. Finally, when participants detected previously learnt targets within visual scenes, adults were slower for targets appearing at unexpected (invalid) locations within social scenes compared to non-social scenes, but this was not the case for children. In their entirety, these findings suggest that the interplay between social attentional biases, memory and memory-guided attention is complex and modulated by age-related differences. Complementary methodologies in developmental cognitive neuroscience shed light on the mechanisms through which social attention and memory interact over development.

Almost all attention and learning-in particular, most early learning-take place in social settings. But little is known of how our brains support dynamic social interactions. We recorded dual electroencephalography (EEG) from 12-month-old infants and parents during solo play and joint play. During solo play, fluctuations in infants' theta power significantly forward-predicted their subsequent attentional behaviours. However, this forward-predictiveness was lower during joint play than solo play, suggesting that infants' endogenous neural control over attention is greater during solo play. Overall, however, infants were more attentive to the objects during joint play. To understand why, we examined how adult brain activity related to infant attention. We found that parents' theta power closely tracked and responded to changes in their infants' attention. Further, instances in which parents showed greater neural responsivity were associated with longer sustained attention by infants. Our results offer new insights into how one partner influences another during social interaction.

In our two studies, we evaluated the significance of attention in self-referential reward processing utilizing an ownership paradigm, which required participants to complete a visual search task to win either monetary rewards (in Study 1) or social rewards (in Study 2) for themselves or for an acquaintance. Access to attentional resources was manipulated by sometimes including a distracting stimulus among the presented stimuli. The results of Study 1 revealed that a significant self-referential reward effect emerged under undistracted attentional conditions and was associated with improved task performance when self-owned monetary rewards were available. However, distracted attention impaired this self-referential reward effect. Moreover, distracted attention was also observed in the self-referential social reward processing in Study 2. These results suggested that distracted attention can impair the pursuit advantage for self-relevant rewards; self-referential processing is strongly dependent on attentional resources. self-relevance; attention; social reward; monetary reward; ownership; Psychology; BF1-990 Frontiers in Psychology, Vol 9 (2019) Jia Zhu; Youlong Zhan\"},{\"id\":\"be9bb49fb7ac765d907f23f596e5fff50abf2a157b17d215fd4bdc56b592dde9\",\"content\":\"Attention to social stimuli is modulated by sex and exposure time in tufted capuchin monkeys The dot-probe task is an experimental procedure commonly used to study how animals (including humans) pay attention to different stimuli. In this study, we evaluated how different durations of image exposure modulate the response to this task and how male and female tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) respond to different social stimuli. Subjects were shown pairs of images of unfamiliar conspecifics: a male vs. a female or two individuals grooming vs. two individuals not engaged in grooming. With shorter image exposures (250 ms) both sexes responded faster to (i.e., biased their attention towards) images of unfamiliar males compared to females, and were unaffected by images of grooming compared to nongrooming. With longer image exposures (1000 ms) females biased their attention towards images of unfamiliar females, while males did not show any difference; in contrast, males biased their attention towards images of grooming compared to nongrooming, while females did not show any difference. We interpret these results as showing that responses to the dot-probe task with different image exposures reflect different attentional phenomena, and that the two sexes differ in how social stimuli affect their attention.

What is less well known, however, is whether such attentional capture also occurs in a wider social context, such as when observing people in pain. In order to explore this possibility, we adopted a novel social-cue detection methodology: the bodies-in-the-crowd task. Two experiments are reported that consider whether nonverbal cues of pain, happiness and anger as expressed through body postures would capture and hold attention. Both experiments recruited 40 (20 male, 20 female) pain-free individuals. Overall, results show that pain postures do not capture attention any more than happiness or anger postures, but disengagement from pain postures was significantly slower across both studies. Gender differences were also found, and were more likely to be found, when crowds comprised both men and women. Male pain postures were more likely to capture attention. Whilst female observers had faster target detection speed, and were quicker to disengage from distractors. They also showed slower disengagement from female expressions overall. Male observers showed no variation based on target or distractor gender. Implications and potential directions for future research are discussed.

In particular, facial attractiveness is an important dimension that considerably influences social judgment. The allocation of attentional resources to facial attractiveness has been widely examined in social psychology, however mostly by measures of eye movement. While this literature demonstrates the influence of facial attractiveness on overt attention, how facial attractiveness drives covert attention is less known. In two studies, we tracked eye and hand movements while participants were engaged in a numerical task in the presence of faces of various degrees of attractiveness. Results show that both attractive and unattractive faces captured greater visual attention compared to moderate faces, whereas attractive faces attracted hand movement more strongly than both unattractive and moderate faces. The present study suggests that facial attractiveness guides attention for actions differently through eye and hand movements. ; Accepted version Business::General; Attractiveness; Mouse-tracking  Faust, Natalie T.; Chatterjee, Anjan; Christopoulos, George I.\"},{\"id\":\"131dd477b11126a36dca59300b81644d1f52422483d42d44eb0928f41d98b501\",\"content\":\"Examining the Significance and Impact of Social Entrepreneurship Social entrepreneurship has garnered a significant amount of attention over the last decade or two.

We adapted a computerized process-based training targeting these attention mechanisms through mouse-based contingency responses and examined its effects on reappraisal and rumination. Forty-one participants were randomly assigned to either a control or an active training condition of mouse-based contingent attention training (MCAT). Participants in the active condition were instructed to allocate attention toward positive words to generate positive interpretations, by using attention regulation while receiving contingent feedback on their attention to emotional words. Participants in the control condition freely generated interpretations without receiving contingent feedback. Transfer to reappraisal and state rumination was evaluated by administering an emotion regulation paradigm before and after the training. Mouse-based attention estimations showed a high degree of congruency with real eye\\/gaze-based attention estimations, as measured with eye-tracking performed in parallel. Furthermore, active MCAT resulted in several beneficial effects, including: 1) a higher attention toward positive over negative information; 2) an improved reappraisal ability to down-regulate negative emotions, and 3) a larger state rumination reduction in comparison to the control group. Our findings supports MCAT as a promising way to monitor and train attention, being an innovative instrument for online interventions aimed to improve stress regulation and resilience.

In conjunction search, visual attention is required to select the items and to bind their features (e.g., color, form, size), which results in a serial search process. In dual-tasks, central attention is required for response selection, but because central attention is limited in capacity, response selection can only be carried out for one task at a time. Here, we investigated whether visual and central attention rely on a common or on distinct capacity limitations. In two dual-task experiments, participants completed an auditory two-choice discrimination Task 1 and a conjunction search Task 2 that were presented with an experimentally modulated temporal interval between them (stimulus onset asynchrony [SOA]). In Experiment 1, Task 2 was a triple conjunction search task. Each item consisted of a conjunction of three features, so that target and distractors shared two features. In Experiment 2, Task 2 was a plus conjunction search task, in which target and distractors shared the same four features. The hypotheses for conjunction search time were derived from the locus-of-slack method. While plus conjunction search was performed after response selection in Task 1, a small part of triple conjunction search was still performed in parallel to response selection in Task 1. However, the between-experiment comparison was not significant, indicating that both search tasks may require central attention. Taken together, the present study provides evidence that visual and central attention share a common capacity limitation when conjunction search relies strongly on serial item selection.

And also how top-down attention and awareness have opposing functions. Methodology: This article is a systematic review of the relationship between visual attention and awareness. An extensive elaborate study on concepts relating to attention and consciousness dissociation has been done. In this article we also narrow it down to experimental design that requires independent manipulation of each. Which include top-down attention and awareness aspect of consciousness? Main Findings: Many researches have been put forward supporting the independent nature of attention from awareness using sophisticated experimental and physiological shreds of evidence. On the other hand, some researches still stick to the contemporary common-sense notion of no awareness no attention. Our evaluation suggests an independent nature of attention and awareness. Application: This article intends to give a clear perspective of the ongoing debate on the relationship between attention and consciousness. Simplification of both umbrella terms will give basis for building more empirical evidence.

We analyzed the newly developed VR continuous performance test (VR-CPT) for Korean children with attention-deficit\\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children (TDC). To identify specific features of a virtual environment that influence the attention performance of children, we investigated whether the presence of a virtual teacher and social cues in the VR environment affects their attention performance. A total of 38 participants (18 TDC and 20 ADHD children and adolescents) were recruited for VR-CPT testing. Bivariate correlational analysis was conducted to examine the associations between the results of the VR-CPT and ADHD questionnaires to determine the capacity of VR-CPT to mirror real-life attention behaviors. Mixed-design analysis of variables was conducted to compare the effects of the social aspects of the VR-CPT on attention performance in groups. There were significant associations between ADHD rating scores and the omission error, commission error, reaction time (RT), reaction time variability (RTV), and total accuracy of the VR-CPT in the ADHD group. In addition, the ADHD group exhibited comparable performance with the TDC group for all measures of the VR-CPT. Also there seemed to be a trend of decreasing RTV when a virtual teacher with social cues was present compared with the equipment control condition in the ADHD group. Performance in the VR-CPT program was associated with behavioral measures of ADHD symptoms. Adding social aspects to a VR environment commonly encountered by children and adolescents has the potential to make a difference in the attention performance of youths with ADHD. ; restriction Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/classification; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/diagnosis; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity*\\/psychology; Child; Cues*; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests*; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality*; attention; continuous performance test; neuropsychological assessment; social cues; virtual reality  \"},{\"id\":\"e63f199c27e6c892dde177ea80de6f2aec072e775f87aea69a0dfca7e554712e\",\"content\":\"The structure of social-evaluative threat detection in social anxiety disorder The integrated aetiological and maintenance (IAM) model of social anxiety disorder (SAD) conceptualises four social-evaluative cognitive processes (anticipatory processing, attention to the self, attention to threat in the environment, and post-event processing) as facets of a social-evaluative threat detection construct. The current study tested this by examining potential factor structures underlying the four social-evaluative cognitive processes. Baseline data from two randomised controlled trials, consisting of 306 participants with SAD who completed measures of the four social-evaluative cognitive processes in relation to a speech task, were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. Model fit indices and bifactor model indices showed that the optimal factor structure was a bifactor model with a Social-evaluative Threat Detection General Factor and two group factors corresponding to anticipatory processing and post-event processing. Analyses also indicated that the Social-evaluative Threat Detection General Factor had moderate to large associations with other constructs in the IAM model, whereas the two group factors only had small associations with these constructs. These findings suggest that the four social-evaluative cognitive processes can be unified as facets of a social-evaluative threat detection process, consistent with the IAM model, although group factors for anticipatory processing and post-event processing need to be taken into account.

But in daily life, we often use past experiences to guide our attentional states. Given the importance of memory for predicting upcoming events, we hypothesized that memory-guided attention is supported by neural preparation for anticipated attentional states. We examined preparatory coding in the human hippocampus and mPFC, two regions that are important for memory-guided behaviors, in two tasks: one where attention was guided by memory and another in which attention was explicitly instructed. Hippocampus and mPFC exhibited higher activity for memory-guided vs. explicitly instructed attention. Furthermore, representations in both regions contained information about upcoming attentional states. In the hippocampus, this preparation was stronger for memory-guided attention, and occurred alongside stronger coupling with visual cortex during attentional guidance. These results highlight the mechanisms by which memories are used to prepare for upcoming attentional goals.

Orienting to facial expressions has typically been conceptualised as due to bottom-up attentional capture. However, this overlooks the contributions of top-down attention and selection history. In the present study, across four experiments, these three attentional processes were differentiated using a variation of the dot-probe task, in which participants were cued to attend to a happy or angry face on each trial. Results show that attention toward facial expressions was not exclusively driven by bottom-up attentional capture; instead, participants could shift their attention toward both happy and angry faces in a top-down manner. This effect was not found when the faces were inverted, indicating that top-down attention relies on holistic processing of the face. In addition, no evidence of selection history was found (i.e., no improvement on repeated trials or blocks of trials in which the task was to orient to the same expression). Altogether, these results suggest that humans can use top-down attentional control to rapidly orient attention to emotional faces.

Via growth-curve analysis, we demonstrate that self-reported empathy (as measured by the empathy quotient\\u2014EQ) predicts the temporal evolution of gaze behaviour under conditions where social and non-social stimuli compete for attention. In both datasets, we found that EQ not only predicted a global increase in social attention, but predicted a different temporal profile of social attention. Specifically, we detected a reliable effect of empathy on gaze towards social images after prolonged viewing. An analysis of switch latencies revealed that low-EQ observers switched gaze away from an initially fixated social image more frequently and at earlier latencies than high-EQ observers. Our analyses demonstrate that modelling these temporal components of gaze signals may reveal useful behavioural phenotypes. The explanatory power of this approach may provide enhanced biomarkers for conditions marked by deficits in empathy-related processes.

Previous work on joint attention has shown that even minimal shared experiences such as watching something together facilitates social closeness between individuals. Here, we examined whether young children already connect with others through joint attention. In the current studies, children sat next to a novel adult who either watched a film with them or was not able to see the film and read a book instead. After the video, we measured children\\u2019s willingness (i.e., latency) to approach the experimenter holding out a toy. In both studies, the 2.5-year-olds who watched the film together approached more quickly than the other children. These results show that both minimally interactive shared experiences and noninteractive shared experiences lead children to feel more comfortable with a novel adult. This suggests that joint attention interactions, and shared experiences in general, play an important role not only in children\\u2019s cognitive development but also in their social development and the formation of their social relationships.

Method: Patients with ADHD ( N = 27), ASD ( N = 23), and ASD + ADHD ( N = 44) completed measures of intellectual functioning (Wechsler tests) and attention functioning (Continuous Performance Test\\u2013Second Edition [CPT-II]) as part of a neurocognitive assessment.

Results: Among patients with ADHD, attention measures contributed to 48% of the variance in total SRS scores, with caregiver-reported hyperactivity\\/impulsivity as the strongest factor. In contrast, among those with ASD + ADHD, attention measures accounted for 40% of the variance, largely due to inattention problems.

Visual task displays occurred in silence or with a neutral or an angry voice. Voices were task-irrelevant in a single-task block, but had to be categorized by speaker sex in a dual-task block. In the single task, angry voices increased the occipital N2 component relative to neutral voices in women, but not men. In the dual task, angry voices relative to neutral voices increased occipital N1 and N2 components, as well as accuracy, in women and marginally decreased accuracy in men. Thus, in women, vocal anger produced a strong, multifaceted visual enhancement comprising attention-dependent and attention-independent processes, whereas in men, it produced a small, behavior-focused visual processing impairment that was strictly attention-dependent. In sum, these data indicate that attention and listener sex critically modulate whether and how vocal emotions shape visual perception. \\u00a9 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Abstract Background The male bias in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses is well documented. As a result, less is known about the female ASD phenotype. Recent research suggests that conclusions drawn from predominantly male samples may not accurately capture female behavior. In this study, we explore potential sex differences in attention to social stimuli, which is generally reported to be diminished in ASD. Population-based sex differences in attention to faces have been reported, such that typically developing (TD) females attend more to social stimuli (including faces) from infancy through adulthood than TD males. It is yet unknown whether population-based sex differences in the face domain are preserved in ASD. Methods A dynamic, naturalistic infrared eye-tracking paradigm measured attention to social stimuli (faces) in 74 school-aged males and females with ASD (male N = 23; female N = 19) and without ASD (male N = 16; female N = 16). Two kinds of video stimuli were presented that varied in social content: rich social scenes (dyadic play between two children) and lean social scenes (parallel play by two children). Results Results revealed a significant 3-way interaction between sex, diagnosis, and condition after controlling for chronological and mental age. ASD females attended more to faces than ASD males in the socially lean condition. This effect was not found in the typically developing (TD) group. ASD males attended less to faces regardless of social context; however, ASD females only attended significantly less to faces compared to TD females in the socially rich condition. TD males and ASD females did not differ in their attention to faces in either condition. Conclusions This study has implications for how the field understands core social deficits in children with ASD, which should ideally be benchmarked against same-sex peers (male and female). Social attention in ASD females fell on a continuum\\u2014greater than their ASD male peers, but not as great as TD females. Overall, their social attention mirrored that of TD males. Improved understanding of the female social phenotype in ASD will enhance early screening and diagnostic efforts and will guide the development of sex-sensitive experimental paradigms and social interventions.

However, not all BI children develop anxiety. Attention bias (AB) may enhance the vulnerability for anxiety in BI children, and interfere with their development of effective emotion regulation. In order to fully probe attention patterns, we used traditional measures of reaction time (RT), stationary eye-tracking, and recently emerging mobile eye-tracking measures of attention in a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds characterized as BI ( N = 23) or non-BI ( N = 58) using parent reports. There were no BI-related differences in RT or stationary eye-tracking indices of AB in a dot-probe task. However, findings in a subsample from whom eye-tracking data were collected during a live social interaction indicated that BI children ( N = 12) directed fewer gaze shifts to the stranger than non-BI children ( N = 25). Moreover, the frequency of gazes toward the stranger was positively associated with stationary AB only in BI, but not in non-BI, children. Hence, BI was characterized by a consistent pattern of attention across stationary and ambulatory measures. We demonstrate the utility of mobile eye-tracking as an effective tool to extend the assessment of attention and regulation to social interactive contexts.

Consequently, efforts to better understand perfectionism have potential transdiagnostic impact. One mechanism proposed to underlie perfectionism is an attention bias towards information signalling threats to perfectionism whereby people with elevated perfectionism selectively attend to threatening stimuli. Method: The present study assessed whether two core dimensions of perfectionism, perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns, are characterised by a threat-related attention bias, and whether this bias was characterised by attention being more rapidly captured by the stimuli (engagement bias), or of greater difficulty to disengage attention (disengagement bias). Participants (N = 108) completed measures of perfectionistic strivings and concerns, and symptoms of psychological distress before completing a modified dot-probe task to measure attention biases. Attention bias index scores were calculated across three factors: engagement bias vs disengagement bias, perfectionism relevant vs irrelevant stimuli, and negative vs positive emotional stimuli. Results: Overall, perfectionistic concerns were associated with a disengagement bias for negative stimuli, regardless of whether stimuli were perfectionism relevant or not. No other significant main or interaction effects were observed. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional in design, and no temporal or causal inferences could be made. Additionally, participants were from a community sample and therefore replication is required in clinical populations. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that individuals higher in perfectionistic concerns experience difficulty withdrawing their attention from emotionally negative stimuli. These findings contribute new information to our theoretical understandings of perfectionism and provide support for the cognitive-behavioural model of perfectionism.

The present study addresses the impact of early language experience on attention to faces in infancy. It was hypothesized that infants learning two spoken languages (unimodal bilinguals) and hearing infants of Deaf mothers learning British Sign Language and spoken English (bimodal bilinguals) would show enhanced attention to faces compared to monolinguals. The comparison between unimodal and bimodal bilinguals allowed differentiation of the effects of learning two languages, from the effects of increased visual communication in hearing infants of Deaf mothers. Data are presented for two independent samples of infants: Sample 1 included 49 infants between 7 and 10 months (26 monolinguals and 23 unimodal bilinguals), and Sample 2 included 87 infants between 4 and 8 months (32 monolinguals, 25 unimodal bilinguals, and 30 bimodal bilingual infants with a Deaf mother). Eye-tracking was used to analyze infants\\u2019 visual scanning of complex arrays including a face and four other stimulus categories. Infants from 4 to 10 months (all groups combined) directed their attention to faces faster than to non-face stimuli (i.e., attention capture), directed more fixations to, and looked longer at faces than non-face stimuli (i.e., attention maintenance). Unimodal bilinguals demonstrated increased attention capture and attention maintenance by faces compared to monolinguals. Contrary to predictions, bimodal bilinguals did not differ from monolinguals in attention capture and maintenance by face stimuli. These results are discussed in relation to the language experience of each group and the close association between face processing and language development in social communication.

The comparison between unimodal and bimodal bilinguals allowed differentiation of the effects of learning two languages, from the effects of increased visual communication in hearing infants of Deaf mothers.

Central and auditory attention are limited in capacity. In dual-tasks, central attention is required to select the appropriate response, but because central attention is limited in capacity, response selection can only be carried out for one task at a time. In auditory search tasks, search time to detect the target sound increases with the number of distractor sounds added to the auditory scene (set sizes), indicating that auditory attention is limited in capacity. Here, we investigated whether central and auditory attention relied on common or distinct capacity limitations using a dual-task paradigm. In two experiments, participants completed a visual choice discrimination task (task 1) together with an auditory search task (task 2), and the two tasks were separated by an experimentally modulated stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Analysing auditory search time as a function of SOA and set sizes (locus-of-slack method) revealed that the auditory search process in task 2 was performed after response selection in a visual two-choice discrimination task 1 (Experiment 1), but concurrently with response selection in a visual four-choice discrimination task 1 (Experiment 2). Hence, although response selection in the visual four-choice discrimination task demanded more central attention as compared with response selection in the two-choice discrimination task, the auditory search process was performed in parallel. Distribution analyses of inter-response time further indicated that parallel processing of response selection and auditory search was not influenced by response grouping. Taken together, the two experiments provided evidence that central and auditory attention relied on distinct capacity limitations.

We present the analysis of attention skills in children with cognitive impairments over a series of child-robot interaction sessions. Here, an interaction consists of five different modules. The first module introduces the child to the robot. The next three modules are the task modules during which children are expected to improve their attention skills during the completion of a series of social tasks. The final module is a free style interaction, where the duration of interaction between the child and robot was used as a proxy to indicate the attention of the child towards a robot. Our analysis showed that the majority of the children reduced their task completion time in modules two to four, indicating an improvement in attention. Moreover, most of the children showed positive engagement towards the robot and spent an average of 120 s during the free style interaction in module five. The positive response suggests that the robot, via child-robot interaction could be a useful and engaging tool to improve attention skills of the children with cognitive impairment.

Research on oxytocin (OT) is currently drawing attention as an endocrine basis for social development. In this study, we investigated the relationship between visual attention to social cues and salivary OT levels in children exposed to CM. The results revealed that the CM group had a significantly lower percentage of gaze fixation for the human face eye area and lower salivary OT levels compared to the typical development group. Moreover, a path analysis suggested that gaze fixation for the eye area was a mediator of the relationship between salivary OT levels and social-emotional problems in the CM group. These results suggest that lower endogenous OT levels in maltreated children may lead to atypical development of their visual attention to eyes as a social cue, resulting in social-emotional problems.
