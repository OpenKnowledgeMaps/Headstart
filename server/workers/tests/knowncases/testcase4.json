While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 55-72 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life\\u2014the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment\\u2014is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles\\u2014liberation, inspiration, and healing\\u2014to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life. Appealing to the Smithsonian\\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture as an example, this paper articulates the possibilities of architectural projects to symbolically and practically support liberative goals in African American religious systems and political movements.\",\"published_in\":\"Religions, Vol 8, Iss 12, p 256 (2017)\",\"year\":\"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"African American religion; African American spirituality; Black Lives Matter; architecture; built environment; womanist ethics; ecowomanism; liberation theology; social justice; National Museum of African American History and Culture; Religions.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley\\u2019s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes\\u2019s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism. The issue at stake is how exemplary crime fictions make sense of, and critically interrogate, the relationship between race, violence and neoliberalism.\",\"published_in\":\"Pepper , A 2019 , ' Race, violence and neoliberalism: crime fiction in the era of Ferguson and Black Lives Matter ' , Textual Practice , vol. 33 , no. 6 , pp. 963-982 . https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/0950236X.2017.1365755\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Race; violence; neoliberalism; crime fiction; The Wire; Ferguson; Black Lives Matter\",\"subject\":\"Race; violence; neoliberalism; crime fiction; The Wire; Ferguson; Black Lives Matter\",\"authors\":\"Pepper, Andrew\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/pure.qub.ac.uk\\/en\\/publications\\/race-violence-and-neoliberalism-crime-fiction-in-the-era-of-ferguson-and-black-lives-matter(9bc7c63d-3cb7-4d26-867c-d655587e4033).html\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"2c9ededff77e84ed3a7b9a6653aaab1ac400a0a1798a6927ac119158f039597b\",\"relevance\":101},{\"id\":\"b54e4d5de743f7b17d0d3a26806bd2fd17bff06a5b098dc0b63df2ec5f05b581\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.fcla.edu\\/jpic\\/article\\/view\\/106120; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2573-4342; 2573-4342; doi:10.32473\\/jpic.v2.i2.p289; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/56eca24171234ec4b6bad596cefa41c7\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.32473\\/jpic.v2.i2.p289; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/56eca24171234ec4b6bad596cefa41c7\",\"title\":\"Tweeting a Social Movement: Black Lives Matter and its use of Twitter to Share Information, Build Community, and Promote Action\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Public relations research has gradually incorporated the study of advocacy organizations.

I will argue that we cannot fully appreciate the depths of what Baldwin called the \\u201csavage paradox\\u201d of race without the insights provided by Klein and object relations psychoanalysis. Conversely, Baldwin helps us to sound out the political significance of object relations approaches, including the work of Klein and those influenced by her such as Hanna Segal and Wilfred Bion.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, \\u201cBlack lives matter!\\u201d This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action. Note: UDP is a platform for voices to be heard. Therefore, this is a personal, self-reflection article for a specific population, and is not a reflection of the beliefs of UDP.\",\"published_in\":\"Understanding and Dismantling Privilege; Vol 7 No 1 (2017): UNDERSTANDING AND DISMANTLING PRIVILEGE; 53-65 ; 2152-1875\",\"year\":\"2017-04-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"subject\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"authors\":\"Harper, Matt\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\/article\\/view\\/16458\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1fd7689619b8b0b8d201792590461cacf4c354bbeb31bb1b1fab6da9f303cdef\",\"relevance\":93},{\"id\":\"2d5cec540056e4fd46e29e6ecbda95c864e2ea8119b474d7d48fe681ee778dd3\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018; hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; doi:10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization ; Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization: An interview with Melina Abdullah by Yohann Le Moigne\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Melina Abdullah is a scholar-activist.

Examining punishment discourses intersectionally unearths profound, unequal distinctions when controlling for the variety of victims\\u2019 identities within the punishment regime. For example, trans women of color are likely to face the harshest of realties when confronted with the prospect of punishment. However, missing from much of the academic carceral literature is a critical perspective situated in racialized epistemic frameworks. If racialized individuals are more likely to be affected by punishment systems, then, certainly, they are the foremost experts on what those realities are like. The Black Lives Matter hashtag came about during the aftermath of the George Zimmerman non-verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and it helped to cultivate the organization which turned into a multiracial international movement in defense of Black dignity and humanity. While Black Lives Matter was initially inspired by police violence, it has expanded its reach to include causes beyond police malpractice and brutality. This special issue of The Prison Journal seeks to merge principles associated with Black Lives Matter (as noted on their website) with critical issues endemic to community reentry after incarceration and the racialized and gendered impediments it produces. The empirical pieces included are qualitative to reflect the epistemologies of the affected, as we believe that narratives more powerfully capture these hard-to-reach (or deviant in comparison to the norm) perspectives. This special issue includes articles that critically foreground the voices of formerly incarcerated citizens (including some who are mothers and fathers) and reentry service providers. Importantly, it provides suggestions for new directions in reimagining a more democratic and racially equitable society without current punishment regimes.\",\"published_in\":\"The Prison Journal ; volume 99, issue 4, page 387-395 ; ISSN 0032-8855 1552-7522\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"authors\":\"Williams, Jason M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0032885519852062\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"74b72e1d9a4950d23d453a8843b22093190bb2b0c1ab34a47a03dda9575e6048\",\"relevance\":90},{\"id\":\"bd78f7e78930aa2ad85ae6af91f1e50c5d95f4aa55c3770e38797a0edfa476ce\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18689; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p101\",\"title\":\"More Threatened Than Safe: What African, Caribbean, and Black Youth Living In Southern Ontario Say About Their Interactions with Law Enforcement.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This study investigates the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) youth living in Windsor, Ontario regarding their interactions with police. Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 101-118 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome.

The author, a well-known Black liberation theologian, who is a child of the Windrush Generation, argues that Western Mission Christianity has always exemplified a deep-seated form of anti-Blackness that has helped to shape the agency of Black bodies, essentially marking them as \\u2018less than\\u2019. This theological base has created the frameworks that have dictated the sematic belief that Black bodies do not really matter and if they do, then they are invariably second-class ones when compared to White bodies.

This paper analyzes those inter-communal negotiations as they played out on the Facebook pages of Muslim scholars, associating discourse models with contestations of community members negotiating the boundaries involved with integrating the heterogeneous discourses of antiracism.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Religion, Media and Digital Culture ; volume 7, issue 1, page 67-89 ; ISSN 2588-8099 2165-9214\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Latif, Jibril\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/25888099-00701005\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"c5ab71134bb8c18477ec66903b2a9e02493cb0285bb82fbce422688774555a36\",\"relevance\":69},{\"id\":\"908e2e33575062142f3fc62a5e8f781a33af36c7577091dff643558923f00d77\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/299; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1941-0832; 1941-0832; doi:10.5195\\/rt.2016.299; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/fbd998e42be640b2bc8088b32ddc4027\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5195\\/rt.2016.299; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/fbd998e42be640b2bc8088b32ddc4027\",\"title\":\"Teaching Celia in the Age of Black Lives Matter\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The emergence of Black Lives Matter has introduced a language of black liberation to a new generation of students.

As a multiracial person committed to racial justice and sympathetic both to those pushing for recognition of multiracial identity and to those who worry such recognition may undermine larger movements, these are questions I have long grappled with both professionally and personally. Of course, multiracial lives matter-but do they constitute a sub-agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement, or is there an independent agenda the moniker \\\"Multiracial Lives Matter\\\" might represent? If the latter, is there a danger that such an agenda might be co-opted by other forces and used to further unintended purposes, such as the advancement of colorblindness?

The second key finding is that BLM organizations generated more tweets that framed the movement as a struggle for individual rights than ones that utilized frames about gender, racial, and LGBTQ identities. Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists urge their followers to pursue disruptive repertoires of contention less frequently than they encourage other political behaviors. These findings suggest that the BLM movement is intelligible through both the resource mobilization and new social movement paradigms within social movement studies.\",\"published_in\":\"The Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics ; volume 4, issue 2, page 297-323 ; ISSN 2056-6085\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Tillery, Alvin B.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/rep.2019.17\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"69176a7250e8e1232196b47dec5c792c43a29d7444138e30eb0b022e55793878\",\"relevance\":62},{\"id\":\"b31f8030b88cedd0b37844206f105ba24910c7fbc0777e189563aa0683513c47\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/s1742058x1600014x; https:\\/\\/www.cambridge.org\\/core\\/services\\/aop-cambridge-core\\/content\\/view\\/S1742058X1600014X\",\"title\":\"TOWARD A CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE STUDIES ; Black Lives Matter as an Environmental Justice Challenge\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract In this paper I expand upon the recent use of the term \\u201cCritical Environmental Justice Studies.\\u201d This concept is meant to capture new developments in Environmental Justice (EJ) Studies that question assumptions and gaps in earlier work in the field.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group \\u2018allies\\u2019. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-10-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wilkins, D.J.; Livingstone, A.G.; Levine, M.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/131987\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"32938a80f4029cdcf71c763386d7e4839fda6eb77fe62058e9b530e0e96b7391\",\"relevance\":57},{\"id\":\"86fd70d27bddc5072f8109edd910af370730370558686e20cd29c0b4849cfc01\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dialnet.unirioja.es\\/servlet\\/oaiart?codigo=6810270\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter a trav\\u00e9s de las series de televisi\\u00f3n estadunidenses\",\"paper_abstract\":\"En el presente art\\u00edculo me propongo explorar c\\u00f3mo las demandas del movimiento antirracista afroamericano Black Lives Matter han sido reflejadas en las series de televisi\\u00f3n estadunidenses.

My interest is to discuss how social criticism is featured in these narratives from an intersectional perspective concerned with class, gender, and race.\",\"published_in\":\"Norteam\\u00e9rica, ISSN 1870-3550, Vol. 13, N\\u00ba. 2, 2018\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Television series; Afro-American culture; racial capitalism; police violence; Series de televisi\\u00f3n; cultura afroamericana; capitalismo racial; violencia policial\",\"subject\":\"Television series; Afro-American culture; racial capitalism; police violence; Series de televisi\\u00f3n; cultura afroamericana; capitalismo racial; violencia policial\",\"authors\":\"Iborra Mallent, Juan Vicente\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dialnet.unirioja.es\\/servlet\\/oaiart?codigo=6810270\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"86fd70d27bddc5072f8109edd910af370730370558686e20cd29c0b4849cfc01\",\"relevance\":56},{\"id\":\"1ea7aaf379587399d8b4a493f33472c6d34ae874be4835a2cfcc0ff745e2e809\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/hmongstudies.org\\/VueScheinVangHSJ17.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1091-1774; 1091-1774; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/ac0e9ceb91ef42e08f0262211cc08281\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/ac0e9ceb91ef42e08f0262211cc08281\",\"title\":\"Comparative Racialization and Unequal Justice in the Era of Black Lives Matter: The Dylan Yang Case\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Through a close examination of the Dylan Yang-Isaiah Powell case in Wausau, Wisconsin, we argue that while Hmong experiences may have remained marginalized or invisible in the era of Black Lives Matter, this case and the mobilization efforts around it suggest both commonalities and disjunctures among boys of color, especially in relation to the US justice system. The Dylan Yang case, in which a Hmong teen was convicted of murder for the stabbing of another boy, perceived to be black Latino, in an altercation at his home, demands comparative racialization analytics to gain perspective on the implementation of unequal justice. Unpacking the effects of the gangster stereotype, especially for Southeast Asian youth, we suggest how, despite the Asian American model minority trope, Hmong American boys have been racialized as monstrous thugs comparable (but not identical) to their black and Latino counterparts, and thus treated by law enforcement as suspects in need of \\u201ccataloging\\u201d as part of the school-to-prison pipeline. We also delve into the actual practices of young men in order to reveal their strategies in tense and conflictual multiracial contexts, then turn to issues such as long sentences and juvenile solitary confinement that imply the disposability of young lives of color.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 85-100 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Black Lives Matter; Black women; anti-racism; mental health; social determinants of health; Philosophy.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach Drawing on Critical Race Theory (CRT) the paper contends that 1) sport is a contested site, 2) sport is a microcosm of society 3) \\u201crace\\u201d and everyday racism are central to our understanding of sport. It overlays this critique with a recognition of the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of racisms. Findings While the deaths of Black lives are being mourned it is argued that our attention can also become distracted by narrow manifestations of racism (overt). Such approaches leave key stakeholders efforts focused on the individual to the detriment of challenging systemic policies, practices and dispositions that entrench racism. The color-coded racism of past decades is still with us but in addition to this, our critiques and activism require continued surveillance of cultural, institutional and structural arrangements in the everyday that remain nebulous, complex and difficult to challenge. Research limitations\\/implications This is a viewpoint paper. The author draws on previous original empirical work and current insights to draw parallels between sport, Black Lives Matter and broader social contexts. Due to limitations in the extant literature in regard to the section on cycling and ethnicity, examples are drawn primarily from the US and UK. Practical implications This focus on sport and leisure past times demonstrates that the Black experience of \\u201crace\\u201d and racism transcends social boundaries and cannot be perceived as restricted to narrow social domains. Social implications Racisms are embedded in society and therefore its cultural products of which sport is a significant one should not be marginalised in antiracism efforts and activist scholarship. Originality\\/value This paper draws on the author's original published research and current insights. The paper makes a contribution to the development of critical race theorising to the sociology of sport, and broader ethnic and racial studies.\",\"published_in\":\"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal ; volume ahead-of-print, issue ahead-of-print ; ISSN 2040-7149\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sociology and Political Science; Gender Studies\",\"subject\":\"Sociology and Political Science; Gender Studies\",\"authors\":\"Hylton, Kevin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/edi-07-2020-0185\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"5d4130e423ca28ee72de74fefa9844d988c1a345c4423f9f9ca9f8123f9546fd\",\"relevance\":53},{\"id\":\"b0f7d1b7a987fe6de5062d7b2e09457880e39fcf0bb032b36b576aba9c5922fa\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.tdl.org\\/ceaforum\\/index.php\\/ceaforum\\/article\\/view\\/7105\\/6189; https:\\/\\/journals.tdl.org\\/ceaforum\\/index.php\\/ceaforum\\/article\\/view\\/7105\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.tdl.org\\/ceaforum\\/index.php\\/ceaforum\\/article\\/view\\/7105\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter: Teaching African American Literature and the Struggle\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In theorizing how we should pedagogically approach African American literature, especially in courses for undergraduates, I argue that we have to move away from questions of what was or even what is African American literature and, instead, find ways to teach African American literature in both its historical contexts\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dartistic and political\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dand its contemporary resonances. We can embrace the ways the field and each piece of literature simultaneously was and is. Importantly, we can think about what both African American literature and the course on this literature need to be in ways that focus on past, present, and future.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term \\u201cNigerian Lives Matter.\\u201e They appropriated from \\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\\u201e the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans\\u2019 familiarity with America\\u2019s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era.\",\"published_in\":\"Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Abimbola A.

As powerfully placed, Indigenous and non-Indigenous nursing and midwifery professionals, together we can ensure an effective and robust Indigenous curriculum in our nursing and midwifery schools of education. Today, Australia finds itself in a shifting tide of social change, where the voices for better and safer health care ring out loud. Voices for justice, equity and equality reverberate across our cities, our streets, homes, and institutions of learning. It is a call for new songlines of reform. The need to embed meaningful Indigenous health curricula is stronger now than it ever was for Australian nursing and midwifery. It is essential that nursing and midwifery leadership continue to build an authentic collaborative environment for Indigenous curriculum development. Bipartisan alliance is imperative for all academic staff to be confident in their teaching and learning experiences with Indigenous health syllabus. This paper is a call out. Now is the time for Indigenous and non-Indigenous nurses and midwives to make a stand together, for justice and equity in our teaching, learning, and practice.

A sample of 187 adolescents ages 15 to 23 completed surveys, and hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to identify variables associated with psychological outcomes. Higher self-efficacy, curiosity, social support, and the availability\\/involvement with spiritual, cultural, and educational opportunities were related to greater psychological wellbeing.

However, the contemporary movement for Black Lives calls for an intersectional approach to Black politics. Its platform requires participants to take seriously the notion that since Black communities are diverse, so are the needs of its members. To what extent are Blacks likely to believe that those who face secondary marginalization should be prioritized on the Black political agenda? What is the role of linked fate in galvanizing support around these marginalized Blacks? To what extent does respectability politics serve to hinder a broader embrace of Blacks who face different sets of interlocking systems of oppression, such as Black women, formerly incarcerated Blacks, undocumented Black people, and Black members of LBGTQ communities in an era marked by Black social movements?

White supremacists and White nationalists did not hide their racist ideologies as they demanded that their privileged place in history not be erased. The BLM movement, which challenges state-sanctioned anti-Black racism, was ready to confront themes of White discontent and reverse racism, critiques of political correctness, and the assumption that racialized people should know their place and be content to be the subordinate other.It is easy to frame the events in Charlottesville as indicative of US-specific race problems. However, a sense that White spaces should prevail and an ongoing history of anti-Black racism are not unique to the United States. The rise of Canadian activism under the BLM banner also signals a movement to change Canadian forms of institutional racism in policing, education, and the labor market. This article responds to perceptions that the BLM movement has given insufficient attention to environmental concerns (Pellow 2016; Halpern 2017). Drawing on critical race theory as a conceptual tool, this article focuses on the Canadian context as part of the author\\u2019s argument in favor of greater collaboration between BLM and the environmental justice (EJ) movement in Canada.

The movement has garnered considerable attention from the U.S. media and is well recognized by the U.S. public (Horowitz and Livingston 2016; Neal 2017). Social movement scholars suggest that such robust mobilizations are typically predicated on clear social movement frames (Benford and Snow 2000; Snow et al. 1986). Tillery (2019b) has identified several distinct message frames within the social media communications of BLM activists. In this paper, we use a survey experiment to test the effect of three of these frames\\u2014Black Nationalist, Feminist, and LGBTQ+ Rights\\u2014on the mobilization of African Americans.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement. It also explores the implications of education, engagement, and activism for people of color and libraries today. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The authors have engaged the topic from a critical race perspective as a practice in exercising voice \\u2013 telling stories, presenting counterstories, and practicing advocacy (Ladson-Billings, 1998). Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields. This paper has implications for developing understanding of questions about equitable service provision.\",\"published_in\":\"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal, 36(8)\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"black lives matter; library; social justice; community; inclusion; libraries; communities; neutrality; diversity; equity\",\"subject\":\"black lives matter; library; social justice; community; inclusion; libraries; communities; neutrality; diversity; equity\",\"authors\":\"index:\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.17615\\/pyyv-r646\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"e644bc514b8c2bb5339de461ada6ebe7c30d125c633eeae192c4e71f8b3d7fe4\",\"relevance\":29},{\"id\":\"f26a8dc521932e9ee4a3ba012b5ae40f81ed2b9d3b3ef2f360255f9a96728608\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1080\\/23311983.2017.1390917; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2331-1983; 2331-1983; doi:10.1080\\/23311983.2017.1390917; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f0804f5fb081489385fbc8857a8c756d\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/23311983.2017.1390917; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/f0804f5fb081489385fbc8857a8c756d\",\"title\":\"What\\u2019s wrong with inevitable progress?

Atheism here, while indeed denying the existence of gods, has as its primary concern affirming life. Too often is theology, as theologian Anthony Pinn says, \\u201ca theology of no-body\\u201d; thus atheistic feminist Blackness, as understood here, seeks to entrench the body rather than abstract it. Atheistic feminist Blackness reinscribes and affirms the subjectivity and humanity of Black, female, and trans bodies, countering hegemonic discourse that explicitly and implicitly states otherwise. The article\\u2019s emphasis of an atheistic posture stems from the prescient words of Catherine Keller: \\u201catheist or agnostic feminists ignore the God-word at their own peril.\\u201d Therefore, the Black feminist ideological argument takes the \\u201cGod-word\\u201d seriously, reckons with it, and offers an alternative to a theological tradition that often imbues the body with inherent flaw (sin), abstraction (soul), and erasure of the ontological value of Black, female, and noncisgendered bodies.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Feminist Scholarship, Iss 9, Pp 1-17 (2015)\",\"year\":\"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"atheism; radical feminism; Blackness; embodiment; Black Lives Matter; Women.

In short, white backlash is built into the liberal construction of race. Utilizing Joel Olson\\u2019s conception of Herrenvolk democracy, this article analyzes how the color-blind norm of race moves race into a sphere of discourse where it is omnipresent but also disempowered for any legal remedy. Policing becomes an institution by which race is made apparent, as the inequitable treatment by the police dictates who is protected by the color line. Drawn from polling surveys and government reports, data is provided with regard to the unchanging perceptions of racial attitudes. Black Lives Matter takes up the Black radical tradition in order to reassert Black humanity in the face of a system that normalizes racial violence, racial terror, and its own racial ignorance. In this way BLM displays the counternarrative to white hegemony. This counternarrative forces us to realize the depth of the race problem by mobilizing a language of abolition. Circling back to Olson\\u2019s abolition democracy, this article concludes by looking at how far we must go in terms of applying abolition to our discourse, language, conception of humanity, and democracy.\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 2, page 311-323 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Briscoe, Chaz\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.2.311\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"bcefa1242cfc9058e42c3130b783d68c82521b49934eedc0b16d02fc7ac2460e\",\"relevance\":26},{\"id\":\"c5840acc2c2fbf524faaf733ac15380e059461ca136d8a6e4aa65878d69cf21d\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/307\\/238; http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/307\\/593; http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/307; doi:10.5195\\/rt.2016.307\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/307; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5195\\/rt.2016.307\",\"title\":\"Examining Race & Racism in the University: A Class Project\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The rise of black consciousness through \\u201cBlack Lives Matter\\u201d protests and recent events regarding police shootings of unarmed people of color have triggered a national dialogue on race, privilege, and discrimination.

Much research has theorized on how digital networks transmit mobilizing content, fewer studies examine the structure of online networks, and even fewer test how the structure of online networks affects participation for political behaviors with differing costs. From a structural network perspective, I highlight the puzzle: If according to recent literature, digital networks are loose with many weak ties, how can such a network configuration facilitate high-cost political behavior that requires multiple social reinforcements? I map the following relationships among 655 Twitter users who follow the Black Lives Matter Sacramento chapter and compare the structure of the digital network to three commonly observed ideal type networks. The results show that the digital network is structurally distinct from the ideal types, as it is characterized by an extremely dense cluster but also with many loosely connected components, which I describe as a \\u201ccluster-connective network.\\u201d Results from computer experiments further show that paradoxically, this \\u201ccluster-connective\\u201d configuration benefits participation for high-cost behavior but hinders participation for low-cost behavior. The results illustrate how a structural network perspective helps scholars move from the question of whether digital networks facilitate participation to the conditions under which digital networks encourage participation.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Forces ; ISSN 0037-7732 1534-7605\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sociology and Political Science; History; Anthropology\",\"subject\":\"Sociology and Political Science; History; Anthropology\",\"authors\":\"Hsiao, Yuan\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/sf\\/soaa064\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"cb35a5cf9d8daed1b1253c6166d9fa7bae856943608ee2f679950792356cfbf5\",\"relevance\":23},{\"id\":\"f5d7941757cf6a615fb5a1c901b99b3c58de9e018755c55e13b831401d1a978d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/ijoc.org\\/index.php\\/ijoc\\/article\\/view\\/10518\\/2782; https:\\/\\/ijoc.org\\/index.php\\/ijoc\\/article\\/view\\/10518\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/ijoc.org\\/index.php\\/ijoc\\/article\\/view\\/10518\",\"title\":\"Media Effects and Marginalized Ideas: Relationships Among Media Consumption and Support for Black Lives Matter\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Building on research analyses of Black Lives Matter media portrayals, this inquiry uses a two-wave panel survey to examine the effects news coverage has on the evaluation of the core ideas from the Black Lives Matter social movement agenda.

Also debated is whether or not a genuine social movement is emerging, what form it is taking, and if it can be sustained as places like New York, Cleveland, and Baltimore take Ferguson\\u2019s place on the front page. While much of this work assumes the Ferguson Protest Movement and the now more widely known Black Lives Matter movement to be one and the same, a closer look suggests that the Ferguson protestors maintain organizational and political distinctions unique to this particular group and place. With this in mind, it is important to consider two questions. What was specifically different about the death of Michael Brown and the place in which he lived and died, such that this event sparked sustained protests around the world? And what is different about the core group of protestors that emerged from the events in Ferguson, Missouri?&lt;\\/p&gt;&lt;p class=\\\"p2\\\"&gt;This essay considers a potential paradigm shift in the struggle against the well-honed logics of racialization in the United States and offers a little hope toward the future. As leaders of the early protests in Ferguson would later describe, the need to place their bodies directly on the front lines of the militarized police action initially rose as a response to the spectral flesh of Michael Brown\\u2019s body and had as much to do with pushing back against the historical disciplining of their bodies in space\\u2014as bodies out of place\\u2014as it did with protesting yet another police officer abusing deadly force. This was the critical factor that sparked another kind of flesh in the street in the form of the Ferguson Protest Movement.

Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 101-118 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"African Black and Caribbean Canadians; Black Lives Matter; Police Discrimination; Profiling; Criminal Justice System; Philosophy.

In public discourse, gaming is becoming increasingly synonymous with sexism; with media reporting harassment of female-identifying gamers as well as those who voice concern about these issues. The gendered dimension of these issues tends to be fiercely disputed and has competing understandings in online spaces. This study combined issue network analysis and grounded theory to produce a contextualised exploration of the ways in which sexism was understood in such communities. Analysis of multi-modal data revealed three categories which were strategic in framing this debate including; 1) potential (mis)recognition of such behaviours within these contexts, 2) mistaken emphasis upon the gendered dimension of identity within interactions, and 3) qualification to \\u2018count\\u2019 and be heard on these issues.

This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 9-21 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Community Psychology; Black Lives Matter; diversity; values; intersectional political consciousness; social justice; Philosophy.

I do so in the context of claims and counter-claims about contemporary transformations in what Rheinhart Kosselleck (2004: 241) terms the \\u2018expected otherness of the future\\u2019. Arguing for changes in the form of the \\u2018expected otherness of the future\\u2019 rather than its simple loss, disappearance or absence, I describe how emergency operates around a temporality of exceptionality, urgency and interval. Formal and informal declarations of emergency are, in addition, imbued with hope: the hope that time remains and action can make a difference to events. What the use of declarations of emergency by Black Lives Matter activists does is disrupt the geo-historically specific divide between the everyday and emergency by naming conditions that mix the endemic and the evental as emergencies. In the spark of hope that is the act of declaring that ongoing conditions should be treated as emergencies, the \\u2018otherness of the future\\u2019 folds into and becomes part of the present.\",\"published_in\":\"Sociological review, 2017, Vol.65(3), pp.463-477 [Peer Reviewed Journal]\",\"year\":\"2017-09-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Anderson, B.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dro.dur.ac.uk\\/20324\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f8529f6d014ebb6bd18b76fa0c3dbab11abf32a47ef98b5e1aa325fdffba74bb\",\"relevance\":15},{\"id\":\"2ef25da89d339b1d4445a87d18cf38ea67b8dd9ec6e0094ce7b990d63541c2ed\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1088868320918698\",\"title\":\"Beyond Allyship: Motivations for Advantaged Group Members to Engage in Action for Disadvantaged Groups\",\"paper_abstract\":\"White Americans who participate in the Black Lives Matter movement, men who attended the Women\\u2019s March, and people from the Global North who work to reduce poverty in the Global South\\u2014advantaged group members (sometimes referred to as allies) often engage in action for disadvantaged groups.

We propose that advantaged group members can be motivated to participate in these movements (a) to improve the status of the disadvantaged group, (b) on the condition that the status of their own group is maintained, (c) to meet their own personal needs, and (d) because this behavior aligns with their moral beliefs.

As a fast-paced, rhythmic journey through Black intelligencia, Hastings's performance is inspired by the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, and movements like Black Lives Matter, which highlight a pattern of racial crises emerging around issues of police and community relations, institutional and systemic exclusion, and the disproportionate number of Black men in prison. Rarely are Black men and women represented as allies against a common foe. Hastings counters the notion that Black people cannot advocate and critique one another, while offering a critical Blackademik narrative about the use of performance as an artistic act of political resistance.\",\"published_in\":\"Departures in Critical Qualitative Research ; volume 7, issue 4, page 163-168 ; ISSN 2333-9489 2333-9497\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Hastings, Rachel N.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/dcqr.2018.7.4.163\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"fe31321cdb3fc01e102274765acc4e07b87ebc2c935326518ad71debfd24c372\",\"relevance\":10},{\"id\":\"c40b9ec54faffcb0ae3450b3508c2ba353ed81ef166138acb3e0150be00ceb17\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/re-visiones.net\\/index.php\\/RE-VISIONES\\/article\\/view\\/217\\/390; http:\\/\\/re-visiones.net\\/index.php\\/RE-VISIONES\\/article\\/view\\/217\\/449\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/re-visiones.net\\/index.php\\/RE-VISIONES\\/article\\/view\\/217\",\"title\":\"1 (vida) \\u00f7 0 (negritud) = \\u221e \\u2212 \\u221e o \\u221e \\/ \\u221e: Sobre la materia m\\u00e1s all\\u00e1 de la Ecuaci\\u00f3n de Valor\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Lo que hago en este texto es activar la fuerza disruptiva de la negritud, es decir, su capacidad para rasgar el velo de la transparencia (por brevemente que sea) y revelar lo que se encuentra en los l\\u00edmites de la justicia.\",\"published_in\":\"Re-visiones; N\\u00fam. 7 (2017): \\u00bfEs posible descolonizar las metodolog\\u00edas occidentales?

Moreover, approval for Kaepernick also moderates other forces rooted in group identity, such as identification with the Black Lives Matter movement.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life\\u2014the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment\\u2014is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley\\u2019s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes\\u2019s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism. The issue at stake is how exemplary crime fictions make sense of, and critically interrogate, the relationship between race, violence and neoliberalism.

This experience is shared with an increasing number of young people in the developed North who are also grappling with issues of joblessness and political exclusion. This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people's needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change. However, they have not yet been able to effect systemic change. While profound social transformation takes time, this generation is still wrestling with how to move beyond street protest and have a lasting impact on politics and governance.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, \\u201cBlack lives matter!\\u201d This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith.

Examining punishment discourses intersectionally unearths profound, unequal distinctions when controlling for the variety of victims\\u2019 identities within the punishment regime. For example, trans women of color are likely to face the harshest of realties when confronted with the prospect of punishment. However, missing from much of the academic carceral literature is a critical perspective situated in racialized epistemic frameworks. If racialized individuals are more likely to be affected by punishment systems, then, certainly, they are the foremost experts on what those realities are like. The Black Lives Matter hashtag came about during the aftermath of the George Zimmerman non-verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and it helped to cultivate the organization which turned into a multiracial international movement in defense of Black dignity and humanity. While Black Lives Matter was initially inspired by police violence, it has expanded its reach to include causes beyond police malpractice and brutality. This special issue of The Prison Journal seeks to merge principles associated with Black Lives Matter (as noted on their website) with critical issues endemic to community reentry after incarceration and the racialized and gendered impediments it produces. The empirical pieces included are qualitative to reflect the epistemologies of the affected, as we believe that narratives more powerfully capture these hard-to-reach (or deviant in comparison to the norm) perspectives. This special issue includes articles that critically foreground the voices of formerly incarcerated citizens (including some who are mothers and fathers) and reentry service providers. Importantly, it provides suggestions for new directions in reimagining a more democratic and racially equitable society without current punishment regimes.

This study investigates the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) youth living in Windsor, Ontario regarding their interactions with police. Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.

We suggest that community psychologists, advocates, and policymakers use perspectives and values embedded within Community Psychology in order to help combat this issue. This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.

This article speaks to existential challenges facing Black people, predominantly of Caribbean descent, to live in what continues to be a White dominated and White entitled society. Working against the backdrop of the \\u2018Black Lives Matter\\u2019 movement that originated in the United States, this article analyses the socio-political and cultural frameworks that affirm Whiteness whilst concomitantly, denigrating Blackness. The author, a well-known Black liberation theologian, who is a child of the Windrush Generation, argues that Western Mission Christianity has always exemplified a deep-seated form of anti-Blackness that has helped to shape the agency of Black bodies, essentially marking them as \\u2018less than\\u2019. This theological base has created the frameworks that have dictated the sematic belief that Black bodies do not really matter and if they do, then they are invariably second-class ones when compared to White bodies. In the final part of the article, the author outlines the ways in which Black theology in Britain, drawing on postcolonial theological and biblical optics, has sought to critique the ethnocentrism of White Christianity in Britain in order to assert that \\u2018Black Lives Do Matter\\u2019.

Such assumptions can easily lead us down a slippery slope of reducing five centuries of racism, slavery, and colonialism to a fixed ideology of anti-Blackness intrinsic to the European mind, or worse, mistaking a dynamic racial regime for negligence, ignorance, or \\u201cblindness\\u201d to our humanity, a humanity that requires a visible struggle to be seen.

Drawing on Cavell, Wittgenstein and Ranci\\u00e8re we elucidate \\u201csoul blindness\\u201d as a distinct and basic form of injustice. Ranci\\u00e8re\\u2019s police orders and Cavell\\u2019s soul blindness are mutually constitutive; the undoing of police orders entails a politics of soul dawning. Soul dawning entails acknowledging the humanity of others without erasing difference. In the concluding section we consider white obliviousness to the Black Lives Matters (BLM) movement as a case of soul blindness. Part of the political import of BLM is its capacity to illustrate how practices of soul blindness in the U.S. constitute whiteness in a racialized police order.

The unapologetic emergence of full-fledged black subjectivity onscreen runs parallel to a new chapter in the civil rights movement. Black Lives Matter has propelled long-overdue conversations about policing, the prison-industrial complex, inequality, and structural barriers into the mainstream. The ongoing renaissance in television enabled by streaming platforms and new revenue models has opened doors for artists to explore these issues with revived creative freedom. The feisty sitcoms and criminal dramas that have contained black lives for far too long have been surpassed in quality by works more ambitious, aesthetically daring, and politically relevant. Whether it is FX's Atlanta created by and starring Donald Glover, Marvel's Luke Cage on Netflix, or the intergenerational family politics of Queen Sugar, there isn't a more exciting time to watch black lives matter and shimmer on American screens.

From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change. However, they have not yet been able to effect systemic change. While profound social transformation takes time, this generation is still wrestling with how to move beyond street protest and have a lasting impact on politics and governance.

We also discuss challenges and risks associated with using social media as a platform for scaling up.

The proliferation of social media and smart technology has allowed the recording, documenting, and archiving of police misconduct and brutality against Black bodies. Furthermore, BLM is critical of various institutions that create disparities, including the criminal justice system. This article examines the nexus of BLM and prisoner reentry. Using qualitative research conducted in the weeks and months following the death of Trayvon Martin in February 2012, a collective of formerly incarcerated and recently released Black men discussed and analyzed this death and its impact on the Black community. Here, these individuals shared their ideas surrounding punishment and justice as well as reflected on their own past, present, and future roles in their community.

Recently, however, a widespread cognizance of this strategic miscalculation coupled with the precipitous rise of Islamophobia in the Trump era has younger descendants of Muslim immigrants identifying with the left, combating Islamophobia as a type of racism in intersectional solidarity with other social justice platforms like the Black Lives Matter movement ( blm ). Thus, when fundamental disagreements emerged at the ris conference in late 2016 over endorsing the non-profit blm entity, they sparked robust social media debates.

To further complicate matters, in this short reflection piece, I query how multiracial lives matter in the context of this heated social and political discussion about race. As a multiracial person committed to racial justice and sympathetic both to those pushing for recognition of multiracial identity and to those who worry such recognition may undermine larger movements, these are questions I have long grappled with both professionally and personally. Of course, multiracial lives matter-but do they constitute a sub-agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement, or is there an independent agenda the moniker \\\"Multiracial Lives Matter\\\" might represent? If the latter, is there a danger that such an agenda might be co-opted by other forces and used to further unintended purposes, such as the advancement of colorblindness? To the extent that agenda demands unique recognition of multiracial identity, how can it co-exist with broader identity-based racial justice movements?. ; 50 ; 719-724 ; 3   Lucas, Lauren Sudeall\"},{\"id\":\"69176a7250e8e1232196b47dec5c792c43a29d7444138e30eb0b022e55793878\",\"content\":\"What Kind of Movement is Black Lives Matter? The View from Twitter Abstract This paper examines the ways that social movement organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement use Twitter through three content analysis studies. The main finding presented in the paper is that the modal tweet generated between December 1, 2015 and October 31, 2016 was an emotional response\\u2014an expression of sadness, outrage, or despair\\u2014to police brutality and the killings of African Americans. The second key finding is that BLM organizations generated more tweets that framed the movement as a struggle for individual rights than ones that utilized frames about gender, racial, and LGBTQ identities. Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists urge their followers to pursue disruptive repertoires of contention less frequently than they encourage other political behaviors. These findings suggest that the BLM movement is intelligible through both the resource mobilization and new social movement paradigms within social movement studies.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group \\u2018allies\\u2019. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.

The Dylan Yang case, in which a Hmong teen was convicted of murder for the stabbing of another boy, perceived to be black Latino, in an altercation at his home, demands comparative racialization analytics to gain perspective on the implementation of unequal justice. Unpacking the effects of the gangster stereotype, especially for Southeast Asian youth, we suggest how, despite the Asian American model minority trope, Hmong American boys have been racialized as monstrous thugs comparable (but not identical) to their black and Latino counterparts, and thus treated by law enforcement as suspects in need of \\u201ccataloging\\u201d as part of the school-to-prison pipeline.

Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

Purpose In this invited professional insight paper the author draws parallels between recent debates on racism, Black Lives Matter and related research in sport and cognate domains. Design\\/methodology\\/approach Drawing on Critical Race Theory (CRT) the paper contends that 1) sport is a contested site, 2) sport is a microcosm of society 3) \\u201crace\\u201d and everyday racism are central to our understanding of sport. It overlays this critique with a recognition of the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of racisms. Findings While the deaths of Black lives are being mourned it is argued that our attention can also become distracted by narrow manifestations of racism (overt). Such approaches leave key stakeholders efforts focused on the individual to the detriment of challenging systemic policies, practices and dispositions that entrench racism. The color-coded racism of past decades is still with us but in addition to this, our critiques and activism require continued surveillance of cultural, institutional and structural arrangements in the everyday that remain nebulous, complex and difficult to challenge. Research limitations\\/implications This is a viewpoint paper. The author draws on previous original empirical work and current insights to draw parallels between sport, Black Lives Matter and broader social contexts. Due to limitations in the extant literature in regard to the section on cycling and ethnicity, examples are drawn primarily from the US and UK. Practical implications This focus on sport and leisure past times demonstrates that the Black experience of \\u201crace\\u201d and racism transcends social boundaries and cannot be perceived as restricted to narrow social domains. Social implications Racisms are embedded in society and therefore its cultural products of which sport is a significant one should not be marginalised in antiracism efforts and activist scholarship. Originality\\/value This paper draws on the author's original published research and current insights. The paper makes a contribution to the development of critical race theorising to the sociology of sport, and broader ethnic and racial studies.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term \\u201cNigerian Lives Matter.\\u201e They appropriated from \\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\\u201e the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans\\u2019 familiarity with America\\u2019s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era. performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019) Abimbola A.

Today, Australia finds itself in a shifting tide of social change, where the voices for better and safer health care ring out loud. Voices for justice, equity and equality reverberate across our cities, our streets, homes, and institutions of learning. It is a call for new songlines of reform. The need to embed meaningful Indigenous health curricula is stronger now than it ever was for Australian nursing and midwifery. It is essential that nursing and midwifery leadership continue to build an authentic collaborative environment for Indigenous curriculum development. Bipartisan alliance is imperative for all academic staff to be confident in their teaching and learning experiences with Indigenous health syllabus. This paper is a call out. Now is the time for Indigenous and non-Indigenous nurses and midwives to make a stand together, for justice and equity in our teaching, learning, and practice. Together we will dismantle systems, policy, and practices in health that oppress.

Indicators of resilience are attributes and resources of an individual and the environment that predict positive adjustment. The purpose of this study was to examine the presence of resilience indicators across three ecological levels (individual, familial, environmental) among disadvantaged youth living in Lebanon and to examine whether indicators were associated with psychological well-being and psychological distress. A sample of 187 adolescents ages 15 to 23 completed surveys, and hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to identify variables associated with psychological outcomes. Higher self-efficacy, curiosity, social support, and the availability\\/involvement with spiritual, cultural, and educational opportunities were related to greater psychological wellbeing. Low self-efficacy was the only indicator that was associated with psychological distress independently above and beyond demographic characteristics. Results support the potential importance of considering resilience indicators across ecological levels for interventions seeking to promote positive psychological outcomes for adolescents in highly stressful contexts. psychology; adolescence; resilience Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 136-149 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Respectability Politics and the Limitations of Linked Fate Abstract Cathy Cohen\\u2019s (1999) theory of secondary marginalization helps to explain why the needs of some members of Black communities are not prioritized on \\u201cthe\\u201d Black political agenda; indeed, some groups are ignored altogether as mainstream Black public opinion shifts to the right (Tate 2010). However, the contemporary movement for Black Lives calls for an intersectional approach to Black politics. Its platform requires participants to take seriously the notion that since Black communities are diverse, so are the needs of its members. To what extent are Blacks likely to believe that those who face secondary marginalization should be prioritized on the Black political agenda? What is the role of linked fate in galvanizing support around these marginalized Blacks? To what extent does respectability politics serve to hinder a broader embrace of Blacks who face different sets of interlocking systems of oppression, such as Black women, formerly incarcerated Blacks, undocumented Black people, and Black members of LBGTQ communities in an era marked by Black social movements? We analyze data from the 2016 Collaborative Multi-Racial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) to assess whether all Black lives matter to Black Americans.

White supremacists and White nationalists did not hide their racist ideologies as they demanded that their privileged place in history not be erased. The BLM movement, which challenges state-sanctioned anti-Black racism, was ready to confront themes of White discontent and reverse racism, critiques of political correctness, and the assumption that racialized people should know their place and be content to be the subordinate other.It is easy to frame the events in Charlottesville as indicative of US-specific race problems. However, a sense that White spaces should prevail and an ongoing history of anti-Black racism are not unique to the United States. The rise of Canadian activism under the BLM banner also signals a movement to change Canadian forms of institutional racism in policing, education, and the labor market. This article responds to perceptions that the BLM movement has given insufficient attention to environmental concerns (Pellow 2016; Halpern 2017). Drawing on critical race theory as a conceptual tool, this article focuses on the Canadian context as part of the author\\u2019s argument in favor of greater collaboration between BLM and the environmental justice (EJ) movement in Canada. This article also engages with the common stereotype that Blacks in Canada have it better than Blacks in the United States.

However, little research has focused on social movements in particular. Through a content analysis of all public tweets sent by Black Lives Matter (BLM) over a four-year period, this study examined the message strategies used on Twitter by the social movement as a means to share information, build community, and promote action. Consistent with research on other types of organizations, informational messages proved to be the most common. The study also analyzed the influence that these strategies had on audience engagement in terms of replies and retweets.

An Experimental Test The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has organized hundreds of disruptive protests in American cities since 2013 (Garza 2014; Harris 2015; Taylor 2016). The movement has garnered considerable attention from the U.S. media and is well recognized by the U.S. public (Horowitz and Livingston 2016; Neal 2017). Social movement scholars suggest that such robust mobilizations are typically predicated on clear social movement frames (Benford and Snow 2000; Snow et al. 1986). Tillery (2019b) has identified several distinct message frames within the social media communications of BLM activists. In this paper, we use a survey experiment to test the effect of three of these frames\\u2014Black Nationalist, Feminist, and LGBTQ+ Rights\\u2014on the mobilization of African Americans. We find that exposure to these frames generates differential effects on respondents\\u2019 willingness to support, trust, canvass, and write representatives about the Black Lives Matter movement.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement.

Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields.

Atheism here, while indeed denying the existence of gods, has as its primary concern affirming life. Too often is theology, as theologian Anthony Pinn says, \\u201ca theology of no-body\\u201d; thus atheistic feminist Blackness, as understood here, seeks to entrench the body rather than abstract it. Atheistic feminist Blackness reinscribes and affirms the subjectivity and humanity of Black, female, and trans bodies, countering hegemonic discourse that explicitly and implicitly states otherwise.

In short, white backlash is built into the liberal construction of race. Utilizing Joel Olson\\u2019s conception of Herrenvolk democracy, this article analyzes how the color-blind norm of race moves race into a sphere of discourse where it is omnipresent but also disempowered for any legal remedy. Policing becomes an institution by which race is made apparent, as the inequitable treatment by the police dictates who is protected by the color line. Drawn from polling surveys and government reports, data is provided with regard to the unchanging perceptions of racial attitudes. Black Lives Matter takes up the Black radical tradition in order to reassert Black humanity in the face of a system that normalizes racial violence, racial terror, and its own racial ignorance. In this way BLM displays the counternarrative to white hegemony. This counternarrative forces us to realize the depth of the race problem by mobilizing a language of abolition. Circling back to Olson\\u2019s abolition democracy, this article concludes by looking at how far we must go in terms of applying abolition to our discourse, language, conception of humanity, and democracy.

Much research has theorized on how digital networks transmit mobilizing content, fewer studies examine the structure of online networks, and even fewer test how the structure of online networks affects participation for political behaviors with differing costs. From a structural network perspective, I highlight the puzzle: If according to recent literature, digital networks are loose with many weak ties, how can such a network configuration facilitate high-cost political behavior that requires multiple social reinforcements? I map the following relationships among 655 Twitter users who follow the Black Lives Matter Sacramento chapter and compare the structure of the digital network to three commonly observed ideal type networks. The results show that the digital network is structurally distinct from the ideal types, as it is characterized by an extremely dense cluster but also with many loosely connected components, which I describe as a \\u201ccluster-connective network.\\u201d Results from computer experiments further show that paradoxically, this \\u201ccluster-connective\\u201d configuration benefits participation for high-cost behavior but hinders participation for low-cost behavior. The results illustrate how a structural network perspective helps scholars move from the question of whether digital networks facilitate participation to the conditions under which digital networks encourage participation.

While much of this work assumes the Ferguson Protest Movement and the now more widely known Black Lives Matter movement to be one and the same, a closer look suggests that the Ferguson protestors maintain organizational and political distinctions unique to this particular group and place. With this in mind, it is important to consider two questions.

However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.

In public discourse, gaming is becoming increasingly synonymous with sexism; with media reporting harassment of female-identifying gamers as well as those who voice concern about these issues. The gendered dimension of these issues tends to be fiercely disputed and has competing understandings in online spaces. This study combined issue network analysis and grounded theory to produce a contextualised exploration of the ways in which sexism was understood in such communities. Analysis of multi-modal data revealed three categories which were strategic in framing this debate including; 1) potential (mis)recognition of such behaviours within these contexts, 2) mistaken emphasis upon the gendered dimension of identity within interactions, and 3) qualification to \\u2018count\\u2019 and be heard on these issues. Online spaces reproduce inequalities that exist offline and owing to the technological affordances and contextual nuances, are also sites of cultural production where relations of gendered power may be configured. The implications for transformation efforts to promote inclusive spaces are considered.

We suggest that community psychologists, advocates, and policymakers use perspectives and values embedded within Community Psychology in order to help combat this issue. This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.

Emergency as a descriptor, technique and legal-political device has become a taken-for-granted way of apprehending and governing events and situations. In this paper, I explore the temporality of emergency, through reflections on the use of declarations of emergency in relation to US-based Black Lives Matter protests. I do so in the context of claims and counter-claims about contemporary transformations in what Rheinhart Kosselleck (2004: 241) terms the \\u2018expected otherness of the future\\u2019. Arguing for changes in the form of the \\u2018expected otherness of the future\\u2019 rather than its simple loss, disappearance or absence, I describe how emergency operates around a temporality of exceptionality, urgency and interval. Formal and informal declarations of emergency are, in addition, imbued with hope: the hope that time remains and action can make a difference to events. What the use of declarations of emergency by Black Lives Matter activists does is disrupt the geo-historically specific divide between the everyday and emergency by naming conditions that mix the endemic and the evental as emergencies. In the spark of hope that is the act of declaring that ongoing conditions should be treated as emergencies, the \\u2018otherness of the future\\u2019 folds into and becomes part of the present.

Tensions can arise, however, over the inclusion of advantaged group members in these movements, which we argue can partly be explained by their motivations to participate. We propose that advantaged group members can be motivated to participate in these movements (a) to improve the status of the disadvantaged group, (b) on the condition that the status of their own group is maintained, (c) to meet their own personal needs, and (d) because this behavior aligns with their moral beliefs. We identify potential antecedents and behavioral outcomes associated with these motivations before describing the theoretical contribution our article makes to the psychological literature.

Hastings, The MenStroll Cycles uses literary, performance, and digital art to interrogate antiBlack social conditions and to educate audiences about the historical and cultural cycles leading to criminalization. As a fast-paced, rhythmic journey through Black intelligencia, Hastings's performance is inspired by the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, and movements like Black Lives Matter, which highlight a pattern of racial crises emerging around issues of police and community relations, institutional and systemic exclusion, and the disproportionate number of Black men in prison. Rarely are Black men and women represented as allies against a common foe. Hastings counters the notion that Black people cannot advocate and critique one another, while offering a critical Blackademik narrative about the use of performance as an artistic act of political resistance.

We examine whether retaliatory violence exists between law enforcement and citizens while controlling for any social media contagion effect related to prior fatal encounters. Analyzed using a trivariate dynamic structural vector-autoregressive model, daily time-series data over a 21-month period captured the frequencies of police killed in the line of duty, police deadly use of force incidents, and social media coverage. The results support a significant retaliatory violence effect against minorities by police, yet there is no evidence of retaliatory violence against law enforcement officers by minorities. Also, social media coverage of the Black Lives Matter movement increases the risk of fatal victimization to both law enforcement officers and minorities. Possible explanations for these results are based in rational choice and terror management theories.

Moreover, approval for Kaepernick also moderates other forces rooted in group identity, such as identification with the Black Lives Matter movement. In the end, Kaepernick and the protest movement he leads offers a powerful mobilizing force for African Americans.
