Design\\/methodology\\/approach Drawing on examples from college courses in media and society, organizational communication, and interpersonal communication, the case study shows application of the principles of Black Lives Matter in the college classroom at two different institutions in the urban Northeast USA, where the majority of the students are young people of color and\\/or first-generation college students. Findings The paper shows how founding principles of Black Lives Matter, particularly diversity, intersectionality, loving engagement, and empathy, can be used to guide concrete pedagogical practices. It provides examples of how to use Black Lives Matter as a framework to enhance and improve college teaching to make it more diverse and inclusive. Research limitations\\/implications This case study is based on the author\\u2019s experiences teaching at two majority-minority colleges in Greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA. This paper is not the result of a systematic research study. Practical implications This paper has significant implications for how to enact CSP in higher education settings. This paper is valuable to those looking for specific strategies to include more diverse and inclusive teaching strategies. This research also shows both the utility and impact of Black Lives Matter when applied to higher education. Social implications This paper improves public understanding of Black Lives Matter as a social movement. Originality\\/value Since the Black Lives Matter movement is fairly new, there is limited academic research on it.

Much of the controversy is connected to misunderstanding, distorted portrayals, and attempts to discredit the movement. Through an examination of the history of Black Lives Matter, and consideration of issues such as privilege and polarization, it can be recognized that the Black Lives Matter movement is providing a healthy cultural critique and creative use of pain, anger, and suffering to advocate for human dignity and positive cultural change.

Recent Department of Justice investigations and an expanding set of social science research have added to the empirical evidence that these publicized incidents are emblematic of systemic racism in the application of the law. The Black Lives Matter meme and movement are prominent responses to racism that have animated intense interest and support, especially among African Americans. We summarize recent social science research on Black Lives Matter. As a first step toward understanding the social psychology of the meme and the movement, we apply the dynamic dual-pathway model of protest to Black Lives Matter.

Both the Black Lives Matter movement and counseling psychology propose to confront these realities at multiple levels. Black Lives Matter seeks to increase awareness about systemic racism and promote resilience among Black people. Counseling psychology states values of multiculturalism, social justice, and advocacy. Executive leadership in counseling psychology may seek to promote racial justice, yet struggle with how to participate in Black Lives Matter movements and address racial discrimination within larger systems spontaneously and consistently. However, counseling psychology trainees and professionals are actively involved in the Black Lives Matter movement, leading the way forward.

In this article, I report findings from a qualitative examination of major newspaper portrayals of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement between April and August 2016, before the particularly divisive 2016 presidential election. Inductive textual analyses of 131 newspaper articles indicate that, although the movement\\u2019s goals were represented positively and from the perspective of members of the movement, the newspapers politicized and sensationalized the movement, and they focused far more on supposed negative consequences of the movement. I discuss these findings by drawing on the \\u201cprotest paradigm\\u201d and the \\u201cpublic nuisance paradigm\\u201d in media coverage of social protest movements, arguing that the latter is particularly useful for interpreting portrayals of Black Lives Matter in the prevailing US political climate.\",\"published_in\":\"Civic Sociology ; volume 1, issue 1 ; ISSN 2637-9155\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Umamaheswar, Janani\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/001c.12143\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"80fde515873417f1767a6be80a17bca93fdc2cac748d7401b6264afee02f943f\",\"relevance\":110,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/001c.12143\"},{\"id\":\"53cd0f5ca7a4e8cb2d39e0f4ade0cb4883bc15b61ff3d318f401c0aa23466628\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/304\\/235; http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/304; doi:10.5195\\/rt.2016.304\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/304; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5195\\/rt.2016.304\",\"title\":\"The Architecture of American Slavery: Teaching the Black Lives Matter Movement to Architects\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The spatial dynamics surrounding the murder of Trayvon Martin are rarely discussed in architecture schools.

This movement led by young Blacks unapologetically calls out the shameful, historical legacy of American racism and White supremacy while asserting the humanity and sacredness of Black lives, particularly those of unarmed persons senselessly murdered by police officers. While Black Lives Matter is a new movement, it is also an extension of the 400-year struggle of Black people in America to affirm Black dignity, equality, and human rights, even while the major institutions of American society have propagated doctrines and enforced unjust rules\\/laws to denigrate Black life. Black Christians have found hope and inspiration from the Gospel to claim their humanity and to struggle to gain justice for Black lives and for the lives of all oppressed people. In addition, the Black Lives Matter movement provides a helpful critique of many Black churches, challenging them to confront their biases, which label young Black males as \\u201cthugs\\u201d (the new N-word) and which cruelly demonize the LGBTQ community.

The content and style of these protests reflected both the national political issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement, and highly local and regional struggles over gentrification and displacement. In this article, I analyze these protests in relation to the regional political economy of the tech-industry, the real estate booms, and the attendant \\u2018eviction epidemic\\u2019 in the region. In doing so, I lay out an analysis of the relationship between policing and gentrification in the Black Lives Matter protests in the Bay Area.

In a second section, I argue that the protests created a regional protest geography that, in turn, was met by a regionalized repressive security state. Finally, I read the disruptive practices deployed by these protests as a series of complex and sophisticated contestations which embodied connections among policing, gentrification, and the regional political economy. As such, the Black Lives Matter protests produced an intersectional analysis and can be read as a regional uprising aimed to disrupt the security state.\",\"published_in\":\"Anthropological Theory ; volume 17, issue 3, page 338-364 ; ISSN 1463-4996 1741-2641\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous); Anthropology\",\"subject\":\"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous); Anthropology\",\"authors\":\"Maharawal, Manissa M\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1463499617732501\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"76d6cb85f3aabc748dddb3c659d859a37f6cc246297b1040841cd2626619a7c1\",\"relevance\":105,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/1463499617732501\"},{\"id\":\"3628a175d69110ba2eff807b50a84c1227a21edcef81915ce3577f6c3635317b\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18562; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p55\",\"title\":\"\\u201cI believe in that movement and I believe in that chant\\u201d: The influence of Black Lives Matter on resilience and empowerment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Over the past few years, systemic racism has been increasingly in the news via the work of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 55-72 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

The recent murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have prompted a national debate about the need to address systemic racism in policing within the United States. Recent studies have shown how racial resentment has spilled over into a wide range of political issues that are not associated with race; however, no current research examines how racial resentment might shape whites\\u2019 views toward Black Lives Matter. Employing the racial reaction theory and the 2016 American Election Study Survey, we hypothesize and confirm that whites with high levels of racial resentment, conservative ideology, and those who indicated support for Donald Trump hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement. Our results also show that Asians and Hispanics hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement, but that whites have the highest racial resentment levels. The results raise doubts about whether the recent shift in white public opinion is sustainable. Given that racial resentment is a predictor of support for Black Lives Matter, scholars and activists should approach white support for Black Lives Matter with caution because it is likely that increased racial resentment may lead to sustained white opposition to the movement.\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 4, page 496-515 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Riley, Emmitt Y.; Peterson, Clarissa\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.496\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8d49c339c9cdfbc307b6b905d222f240f4fe507f2ebd8cf98b5981a8c27301ab\",\"relevance\":103,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.496\"},{\"id\":\"9e6b142072fd626675c74a46eb46bda2fc3b57cefa267522e45ee6941cc84bbd\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/esr.2020.43.3.34; http:\\/\\/online.ucpress.edu\\/esr\\/article-pdf\\/43\\/3\\/34\\/416336\\/esr.2020.43.3.34.pdf\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter in the Pacific\",\"paper_abstract\":\"A commentary discussing responses to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in the Pacific Islands and the Pacific diaspora in which the author highlights in particular the widespread support for and solidarity with the BLM movement, while also addressing areas of tension and discomfort in this wide-ranging analysis of Pacific Islander points of view.\",\"published_in\":\"Ethnic Studies Review ; volume 43, issue 3, page 34-38 ; ISSN 2576-2915\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Perez, Craig Santos\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/esr.2020.43.3.34\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"9e6b142072fd626675c74a46eb46bda2fc3b57cefa267522e45ee6941cc84bbd\",\"relevance\":102,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/esr.2020.43.3.34\"},{\"id\":\"fac232eacff0fc907e47d4d61ca54b477e29641cc2831c7e1a827778f322337a\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/CHOBLM\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/CHOBLM\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter and the Call for Death Penalty Abolition\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Black Lives Matter movement has called for the abolition of capital punishment in response to what it calls \\u201cthe war against Black people\\u201d and \\u201cBlack communities.\\u201d This article defends the two central contentions in the movement\\u2019s abolitionist stance: first, that US capital punishment practices represent a wrong to black communities rather than simply a wrong to particular black capital defendants or particular black victims of murder, and second, that the most defensible remedy for this wrong is the abolition of the death penalty.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Philosophy\",\"subject\":\"Philosophy\",\"authors\":\"Cholbi, Michael; Madva, Alex\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/CHOBLM\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"fac232eacff0fc907e47d4d61ca54b477e29641cc2831c7e1a827778f322337a\",\"relevance\":101,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"e2bd7fe82f38ec535e8ac3a5ab7118a2f3974ef9f8aebfbb6459c2a88ec192e5\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/305\\/232; http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/305; doi:10.5195\\/rt.2016.305\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/305; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5195\\/rt.2016.305\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter in Information Literacy\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The institutional racism addressed by the Black Lives Matter movement is encoded in many of the structures of academia, including academic libraries.

By analyzing the movement\\u2019s explicit refusal to be likened to civil rights movement organizations as a concurrent attack against intraracial sexism, heterosexism, and transphobia, the article insists that BLM deprivileges heteronormativity to show that black freedom dreams must include gender and sexual liberation. By considering BLM\\u2019s rejection of capitalism as a broader critique of neoliberalism\\u2019s forceful role in maintaining black dispossession, the author posits that BLM desires to disrupt the state\\u2019s tendency to use the black middle class to enact, enforce, and reinforce an economic order that relies upon race and racism to codify and cement black inequality. Finally, the author posits that the movement\\u2019s tactics and goals provide a framework through which to enact short-term change, while pushing to dismantle the larger system of antiblack racism that is refracted through global capitalism.\",\"published_in\":\"Meridians ; volume 19, issue 2, page 427-452 ; ISSN 1536-6936 1547-8424\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Patterson, Robert J.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1215\\/15366936-8308476\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"60c602d55fe5f71c68e987fb7fdb7bdc6bb4018cc1fb47b08374fe1ca6ea7687\",\"relevance\":91,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1215\\/15366936-8308476\"},{\"id\":\"7bc875065b91e79ffa1fff8726bf0ffa24544d6bc337caed4b69a8afb39f442a\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.msvu.ca\\/index.php\\/atlantis\\/article\\/view\\/5347\\/171-175%20PDF\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.msvu.ca\\/index.php\\/atlantis\\/article\\/view\\/5347\",\"title\":\"\\u201cNot Just What We Dismantle but also What We Hope to Build\\u201d: Alicia Garza on Black Lives Matter and Digital Activism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"AbstractWhat follows is an interview with Alicia Garza about Black Lives Matter and the relationship between traditional and digital activism.R\\u00e9sum\\u00e9Ce qui suit est une entrevue avec Alicia Garza au sujet du mouvement Black Lives Matter et de la relation entre l\\u2019activisme traditionnel et l\\u2019activisme num\\u00e9rique.\",\"published_in\":\"Atlantis: Critical Studies in Gender, Culture & Social Justice; Vol 38, No 2 (2017): Affecting Feminist Literary & Cultural Production & WHOOPS I AM A LADY ON THE INTERNET: Digital Feminist Counter-Publics; 171-175 ; Atlantis: \\u00c9tudes critiques sur le genre, la culture, et la justice; Vol 38, No 2 (2017): Affecting Feminist Literary & Cultural Production & WHOOPS I AM A LADY ON THE INTERNET: Digital Feminist Counter-Publics; 171-175 ; 1715-0698 ; 0702-7818\",\"year\":\"2017-12-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Mulcahy, Clare\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.msvu.ca\\/index.php\\/atlantis\\/article\\/view\\/5347\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"7bc875065b91e79ffa1fff8726bf0ffa24544d6bc337caed4b69a8afb39f442a\",\"relevance\":90,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"3323670dcd336a451bc24b2c223c13d7a8faebcf85d656ce44e771f4b0eb5a13\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/286\\/225; http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/286\\/584; http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/286; doi:10.5195\\/rt.2016.286\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/286; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5195\\/rt.2016.286\",\"title\":\"Refusing to be Complicit in our Prison Nation: Teachers Rethinking Mandated Reporting\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Ensuring that Black Lives Matter in schools requires seismic shifts including excavating the ongoing practices and policies that reproduce heterogendered white supremacy in schools.

This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley\\u2019s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes\\u2019s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism. The issue at stake is how exemplary crime fictions make sense of, and critically interrogate, the relationship between race, violence and neoliberalism.\",\"published_in\":\"Pepper , A 2019 , ' Race, violence and neoliberalism: crime fiction in the era of Ferguson and Black Lives Matter ' , Textual Practice , vol. 33 , no. 6 , pp. 963-982 . https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1080\\/0950236X.2017.1365755\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Race; violence; neoliberalism; crime fiction; The Wire; Ferguson; Black Lives Matter\",\"subject\":\"Race; violence; neoliberalism; crime fiction; The Wire; Ferguson; Black Lives Matter\",\"authors\":\"Pepper, Andrew\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/pure.qub.ac.uk\\/en\\/publications\\/race-violence-and-neoliberalism-crime-fiction-in-the-era-of-ferguson-and-black-lives-matter(9bc7c63d-3cb7-4d26-867c-d655587e4033).html\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"2c9ededff77e84ed3a7b9a6653aaab1ac400a0a1798a6927ac119158f039597b\",\"relevance\":82,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"f455f3e964acddae00f90a024c7265c2b6bfd61aa8d14acc4804d1734a496995\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2077-1444\\/8\\/12\\/256; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2077-1444; 2077-1444; doi:10.3390\\/rel8120256; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3c0ae3984245421fb541f70b95a7775f\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/rel8120256; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3c0ae3984245421fb541f70b95a7775f\",\"title\":\"\\u201cLet\\u2019s Imagine Something Different\\u201d: Spiritual Principles in Contemporary African American Justice Movements and Their Implications for the Built Environment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The Black Lives Matter movement has become one of the most visible, controversial, and impactful campaigns to address racialized violence and discrimination in the 21st century. Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life\\u2014the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment\\u2014is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles\\u2014liberation, inspiration, and healing\\u2014to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life. Appealing to the Smithsonian\\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture as an example, this paper articulates the possibilities of architectural projects to symbolically and practically support liberative goals in African American religious systems and political movements.\",\"published_in\":\"Religions, Vol 8, Iss 12, p 256 (2017)\",\"year\":\"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"African American religion; African American spirituality; Black Lives Matter; architecture; built environment; womanist ethics; ecowomanism; liberation theology; social justice; National Museum of African American History and Culture; Religions.

This experience is shared with an increasing number of young people in the developed North who are also grappling with issues of joblessness and political exclusion. This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people's needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change. However, they have not yet been able to effect systemic change.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 55-72 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Racism; Empowerment; Resilience; Black Lives Matter; Philosophy.

Examining punishment discourses intersectionally unearths profound, unequal distinctions when controlling for the variety of victims\\u2019 identities within the punishment regime. For example, trans women of color are likely to face the harshest of realties when confronted with the prospect of punishment. However, missing from much of the academic carceral literature is a critical perspective situated in racialized epistemic frameworks. If racialized individuals are more likely to be affected by punishment systems, then, certainly, they are the foremost experts on what those realities are like. The Black Lives Matter hashtag came about during the aftermath of the George Zimmerman non-verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and it helped to cultivate the organization which turned into a multiracial international movement in defense of Black dignity and humanity. While Black Lives Matter was initially inspired by police violence, it has expanded its reach to include causes beyond police malpractice and brutality. This special issue of The Prison Journal seeks to merge principles associated with Black Lives Matter (as noted on their website) with critical issues endemic to community reentry after incarceration and the racialized and gendered impediments it produces. The empirical pieces included are qualitative to reflect the epistemologies of the affected, as we believe that narratives more powerfully capture these hard-to-reach (or deviant in comparison to the norm) perspectives. This special issue includes articles that critically foreground the voices of formerly incarcerated citizens (including some who are mothers and fathers) and reentry service providers. Importantly, it provides suggestions for new directions in reimagining a more democratic and racially equitable society without current punishment regimes.\",\"published_in\":\"The Prison Journal ; volume 99, issue 4, page 387-395 ; ISSN 0032-8855 1552-7522\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"authors\":\"Williams, Jason M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0032885519852062\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"74b72e1d9a4950d23d453a8843b22093190bb2b0c1ab34a47a03dda9575e6048\",\"relevance\":72,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0032885519852062\"},{\"id\":\"45bb9d9f22fcd795c88fe469ef86beb2962fe1b0dc5d47d4414a0267ebf58010\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14198\\/raei.2020.33.03; Alicante Journal of English Studies \\/ Revista Alicantina de Estudios Ingleses. 2020, 33: 43-62. https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14198\\/raei.2020.33.03; 0214-4808; 2171-861X (Internet); http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10045\\/111296; doi:10.14198\\/raei.2020.33.03\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/10045\\/111296; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.14198\\/raei.2020.33.03\",\"title\":\"Tracing Emmett Till\\u2019s Legacy from Black Lives Matter back to the Civil Rights Movement\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This paper explores the legacy of the Emmett Till case as one of the core elements which binds together the Civil Rights Movement and the current Black Lives Matter in the US. Donald Trump\\u2019s inauguration in January 2017 has magnified the escalating racial tension of recent years and has, at the same time, fueled several forms of social activism across the United States. Acting as the catalyst for Black Lives Matter, the assassination of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012 stirred the race question in the country as the Till lynching had similarly done fifty seven years before. At the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, the complex relations between race, class, and gender within the South helped to set the atmosphere for one of the starkest assassinations in US history. Till\\u2019s infamous murder soon gave rise to an empowering narrative among the African American community that not only contributed to putting an end to the voracious rule of Jim Crow in the US South but that, with the passage of time, has also become a banner of justice in the current fight against racism, as it seems that recent violent events resuscitate the latent white supremacist ghosts of one of the world\\u2019s most powerful nations. ; The research for this article was funded by the project USRACEBODY, PGC2018-095687-B-I00, AEI\\/ERDF, EU.

We suggest that community psychologists, advocates, and policymakers use perspectives and values embedded within Community Psychology in order to help combat this issue. This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 9-21 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

The in-your-face and unapologetic tone of today\\u2019s movement stands in contrast to romanticized narratives of the peaceful, nonviolent activism of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. The movement\\u2019s titular organization, Black Lives Matter, openly rejects respectability politics\\u2014the notion that individuals and groups must conform to the expectations of white mainstream norms to protect themselves from the harms of white racism and discrimination. In this article, we examine whether generational politics affect Black attitudes toward protest movements, focusing especially on the Black Lives Matter organization. We expect that protest politics are affected by generations of Black Americans who have been socialized in different eras of social and political advocacy with differing views about the actions that are acceptable for Black politics. Consistent with prior literature, we anticipate that generational differences in attitudes toward contestation, varying awareness about the political and social goals of new movements, differences in access to political information, and overall generational socialization toward respectability politics will all affect the degree to which Black Americans support the Movement for Black Lives. Using national-level data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), we find that prior theories of generational politics do not fully explain support for Black Lives Matter. Unexpectedly, we find that older generations of Black Americans are more supportive of the movement than younger generations of Black Americans. We do not find strong evidence of generational effects interacting with awareness of the movement, political opportunity structures, or respectability politics, which suggests the diminishing effects of generational differences along with traditional factors that influence support. Our results underscore the need for research on generational effects to consider the context of political socialization, which varies across generations.\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 4, page 452-473 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Board, Marcus; Spry, Amber; Nunnally, Shayla C.; Sinclair-Chapman, Valeria\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.452\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f36576fcbb284d31e0762131a50470ea0dd7a9215501fc813ca75cdfbf88bc1f\",\"relevance\":64,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.452\"},{\"id\":\"2d5cec540056e4fd46e29e6ecbda95c864e2ea8119b474d7d48fe681ee778dd3\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018; hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; doi:10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization ; Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization: An interview with Melina Abdullah by Yohann Le Moigne\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Melina Abdullah is a scholar-activist.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, \\u201cBlack lives matter!\\u201d This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action. Note: UDP is a platform for voices to be heard. Therefore, this is a personal, self-reflection article for a specific population, and is not a reflection of the beliefs of UDP.\",\"published_in\":\"Understanding and Dismantling Privilege; Vol 7 No 1 (2017): UNDERSTANDING AND DISMANTLING PRIVILEGE; 53-65 ; 2152-1875\",\"year\":\"2017-04-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"subject\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"authors\":\"Harper, Matt\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\/article\\/view\\/16458\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1fd7689619b8b0b8d201792590461cacf4c354bbeb31bb1b1fab6da9f303cdef\",\"relevance\":62,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"83458deb5a905293ca39071eedc07f7b40b64454e101f771e925274e70adc421\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/revistas.pucsp.br\\/aurora\\/article\\/view\\/32577\\/27271\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/revistas.pucsp.br\\/aurora\\/article\\/view\\/32577\",\"title\":\"Black lives matter: o uso de dispositivos m\\u00f3veis no registro, den\\u00fancia e mobiliza\\u00e7\\u00e3o contra a viol\\u00eancia racial nos Estados Unidos.\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Este artigo discute o uso de dispositivos m\\u00f3veis na den\\u00fancia de recentes epis\\u00f3dios de viol\\u00eancia racial nos Estados Unidos.

As a multiracial person committed to racial justice and sympathetic both to those pushing for recognition of multiracial identity and to those who worry such recognition may undermine larger movements, these are questions I have long grappled with both professionally and personally. Of course, multiracial lives matter-but do they constitute a sub-agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement, or is there an independent agenda the moniker \\\"Multiracial Lives Matter\\\" might represent? If the latter, is there a danger that such an agenda might be co-opted by other forces and used to further unintended purposes, such as the advancement of colorblindness?

Recently, however, a widespread cognizance of this strategic miscalculation coupled with the precipitous rise of Islamophobia in the Trump era has younger descendants of Muslim immigrants identifying with the left, combating Islamophobia as a type of racism in intersectional solidarity with other social justice platforms like the Black Lives Matter movement ( blm ). Thus, when fundamental disagreements emerged at the ris conference in late 2016 over endorsing the non-profit blm entity, they sparked robust social media debates.

Restorative justice as a means to reclaim humanity\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose Overwhelming evidence suggests that black lives have not and do not matter in the American workplace. In fact, disturbing themes of black labor dehumanization, exploitation and racial discrimination appear throughout history into the present-day workplace. Yet, curiously, organizations and organizational scholars largely ignore how racism and slavery have informed management practice (Cooke, 2003) and contemporary workplace racism. The authors address this gap, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a platform. BLM is a social justice movement created in response to the pervasive racism experienced by black people. The purpose of this paper is to accomplish five goals, which are summarized in the following sections. Design\\/methodology\\/approach First, the authors outline historical themes of black labor dehumanization, exploitation and racial discrimination, providing specific examples to illustrate these themes and discussing their contemporary workplace implications. Second, key challenges that may arise as organizations seek to make black lives matter in the workplace are discussed. Third, the authors provide examples of organizations where black lives have mattered as an inspiration for how workplaces can affirm the humanity and self-actualization of black people. Findings Fourth, the authors provide organizations with helpful tools to truly make black lives matter in the workplace, using restorative justice as a framework to remedy workplace racism. Finally, while the paper is largely focused on business organizations, as two management scholars, the authors felt compelled to briefly articulate how academic scholarship might be influenced if black lives truly mattered in management scholarship and management education. Originality\\/value This paper begins to articulate how black lives matter in the workplace. The goal is to intervene and upend the exploitation of black workers so that they are finally recognized for their worth and value and treated as such. The authors have provided historical context to illustrate that contemporary workplace racism is rooted in the historical exploitation of black people from enslavement to contemporary instances of labor exploitation. The authors offer a restorative justice framework as a mechanism to redress workplace racism, being careful to outline key challenges with implementing the framework. The authors concluded with steps that organizations may consider as they work to repair the harm of workplace racism and rebuild trust amongst employees. Specifically, the authors discuss the benefits of organizational interventions that provide intergroup contact with an emphasis on perspective taking, and present a case example and suggested key indicators that black lives matter in today\\u2019s workplace.\",\"published_in\":\"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal ; volume 36, issue 8, page 707-719 ; ISSN 2040-7149\",\"year\":\"2017\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sociology and Political Science; Gender Studies\",\"subject\":\"Sociology and Political Science; Gender Studies\",\"authors\":\"Opie, Tina; Roberts, Laura Morgan\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/edi-07-2017-0149\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"2342e0691ab98aba5796702326d39677750de26ae39e537823843dac58884b98\",\"relevance\":22,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"https:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/edi-07-2017-0149\"},{\"id\":\"b0f7d1b7a987fe6de5062d7b2e09457880e39fcf0bb032b36b576aba9c5922fa\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.tdl.org\\/ceaforum\\/index.php\\/ceaforum\\/article\\/view\\/7105\\/6189; https:\\/\\/journals.tdl.org\\/ceaforum\\/index.php\\/ceaforum\\/article\\/view\\/7105\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/journals.tdl.org\\/ceaforum\\/index.php\\/ceaforum\\/article\\/view\\/7105\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter: Teaching African American Literature and the Struggle\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In theorizing how we should pedagogically approach African American literature, especially in courses for undergraduates, I argue that we have to move away from questions of what was or even what is African American literature and, instead, find ways to teach African American literature in both its historical contexts\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dartistic and political\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dand its contemporary resonances. We can embrace the ways the field and each piece of literature simultaneously was and is. Importantly, we can think about what both African American literature and the course on this literature need to be in ways that focus on past, present, and future.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach Drawing on Critical Race Theory (CRT) the paper contends that 1) sport is a contested site, 2) sport is a microcosm of society 3) \\u201crace\\u201d and everyday racism are central to our understanding of sport. It overlays this critique with a recognition of the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of racisms. Findings While the deaths of Black lives are being mourned it is argued that our attention can also become distracted by narrow manifestations of racism (overt). Such approaches leave key stakeholders efforts focused on the individual to the detriment of challenging systemic policies, practices and dispositions that entrench racism. The color-coded racism of past decades is still with us but in addition to this, our critiques and activism require continued surveillance of cultural, institutional and structural arrangements in the everyday that remain nebulous, complex and difficult to challenge. Research limitations\\/implications This is a viewpoint paper. The author draws on previous original empirical work and current insights to draw parallels between sport, Black Lives Matter and broader social contexts. Due to limitations in the extant literature in regard to the section on cycling and ethnicity, examples are drawn primarily from the US and UK. Practical implications This focus on sport and leisure past times demonstrates that the Black experience of \\u201crace\\u201d and racism transcends social boundaries and cannot be perceived as restricted to narrow social domains.

Rather, racism is endemic and pervasive in the UK context, manifesting at every level of policing. From stop and search, to deaths after police contact, the authors highlight long-standing and widespread racist disparities in UK policing.

In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, yet again, the USA has witnessed police brutality leading to the death of a Black man, George Floyd. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, founded in the US but now an international organisation which challenges white supremacy and deliberates harm against Black people, mobilised hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets across the globe. Increasingly, the protests focus not only on George Floyd's murder but also the continued failure to challenge the celebrity of those involved in the transatlantic slave trade and European imperialism. In this article, the author will contend that many organisations are now reexamining their association with these historical wrongs against Black Africa and its diaspora. Further, the author will contend but that the failure to highlight the role of Black chattel slavery and imperialism in the accumulation of economic, commercial and political benefits reaped by the global north is a source of shame not only for many firms and institutions but also for universities. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The author has reviewed the online media for the latest developments in response to Black Lives Matter's George Floyd campaign in 2020 and reviewed the literature on the link between European global ambition and its impact on the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa. Findings Internationally, there is a discernible change in outlook towards the importance of the evils of slavery and colonialism on the Black experience today. These small steps will require scholars to embark on a fresh reexamination of race, society and work. Originality\\/value For decades, the slave trade and colonialism were issues rarely raised in government, firms and business schools. This will inevitably change especially in those countries that are the main beneficiaries of Black chattel slavery and colonial exploitation.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group \\u2018allies\\u2019. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-10-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wilkins, D.J.; Livingstone, A.G.; Levine, M.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/131987\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"32938a80f4029cdcf71c763386d7e4839fda6eb77fe62058e9b530e0e96b7391\",\"relevance\":17,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"655d6bfae8ba453edc75e9e94ca018e3956ec8029c6978e295f2272d6867fb47\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0953946819843468; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/pdf\\/10.1177\\/0953946819843468; http:\\/\\/journals.sagepub.com\\/doi\\/full-xml\\/10.1177\\/0953946819843468\",\"title\":\"Do Black Lives Matter in Post-Brexit Britain?\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article speaks to existential challenges facing Black people, predominantly of Caribbean descent, to live in what continues to be a White dominated and White entitled society.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term \\u201cNigerian Lives Matter.\\u201e They appropriated from \\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\\u201e the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans\\u2019 familiarity with America\\u2019s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era.\",\"published_in\":\"Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Abimbola A.

My interest is to discuss how social criticism is featured in these narratives from an intersectional perspective concerned with class, gender, and race.\",\"published_in\":\"Norteam\\u00e9rica, ISSN 1870-3550, Vol. 13, N\\u00ba. 2, 2018\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"Television series; Afro-American culture; racial capitalism; police violence; Series de televisi\\u00f3n; cultura afroamericana; capitalismo racial; violencia policial\",\"subject\":\"Television series; Afro-American culture; racial capitalism; police violence; Series de televisi\\u00f3n; cultura afroamericana; capitalismo racial; violencia policial\",\"authors\":\"Iborra Mallent, Juan Vicente\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dialnet.unirioja.es\\/servlet\\/oaiart?codigo=6810270\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"86fd70d27bddc5072f8109edd910af370730370558686e20cd29c0b4849cfc01\",\"relevance\":10,\"resulttype\":[\"Journal\\/newspaper article\"],\"doi\":\"\"},{\"id\":\"2f0dc5a75142b2fb20cd169e17ace2359e75c7f6e9e0a14b781ee523796659af\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/ALVDNE\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/philpapers.org\\/rec\\/ALVDNE\",\"title\":\"Dial\\u00e9tica negativa e radicalismo negro: Angela Davis nos anos 1960\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The article focuses on a chapter of the biography of Angela Davis which, unless mistaken, has not yet received due attention: the training and intellectual experience with her German professors, Herbert Marcuse and Theodor W.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach Drawing on examples from college courses in media and society, organizational communication, and interpersonal communication, the case study shows application of the principles of Black Lives Matter in the college classroom at two different institutions in the urban Northeast USA, where the majority of the students are young people of color and\\/or first-generation college students. Findings The paper shows how founding principles of Black Lives Matter, particularly diversity, intersectionality, loving engagement, and empathy, can be used to guide concrete pedagogical practices. It provides examples of how to use Black Lives Matter as a framework to enhance and improve college teaching to make it more diverse and inclusive. Research limitations\\/implications This case study is based on the author\\u2019s experiences teaching at two majority-minority colleges in Greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA. This paper is not the result of a systematic research study. Practical implications This paper has significant implications for how to enact CSP in higher education settings. This paper is valuable to those looking for specific strategies to include more diverse and inclusive teaching strategies. This research also shows both the utility and impact of Black Lives Matter when applied to higher education. Social implications This paper improves public understanding of Black Lives Matter as a social movement. Originality\\/value Since the Black Lives Matter movement is fairly new, there is limited academic research on it.

Black Lives Matter represents one of the most influential and controversial of the contemporary protests movements. Much of the controversy is connected to misunderstanding, distorted portrayals, and attempts to discredit the movement. Through an examination of the history of Black Lives Matter, and consideration of issues such as privilege and polarization, it can be recognized that the Black Lives Matter movement is providing a healthy cultural critique and creative use of pain, anger, and suffering to advocate for human dignity and positive cultural change. Furthermore, the principles of existential\\u2013humanistic psychology can be used to deepen the understanding of Black Lives Matter and other protest movements, while also offering important guidance on how to avoid various potential risks to the movement\\u2019s success.

Recent Department of Justice investigations and an expanding set of social science research have added to the empirical evidence that these publicized incidents are emblematic of systemic racism in the application of the law. The Black Lives Matter meme and movement are prominent responses to racism that have animated intense interest and support, especially among African Americans. We summarize recent social science research on Black Lives Matter. As a first step toward understanding the social psychology of the meme and the movement, we apply the dynamic dual-pathway model of protest to Black Lives Matter. Examinations of the dynamics of real-world movements such as Black Lives Matter may enrich psychology conceptually, methodologically, and practically.

Both the Black Lives Matter movement and counseling psychology propose to confront these realities at multiple levels. Black Lives Matter seeks to increase awareness about systemic racism and promote resilience among Black people. Counseling psychology states values of multiculturalism, social justice, and advocacy. Executive leadership in counseling psychology may seek to promote racial justice, yet struggle with how to participate in Black Lives Matter movements and address racial discrimination within larger systems spontaneously and consistently. However, counseling psychology trainees and professionals are actively involved in the Black Lives Matter movement, leading the way forward. Through the framework of spontaneity in social movements, this manuscript highlights what counseling psychologists are currently contributing to Black Lives Matter and makes recommendations that build on the opportunity counseling psychologists have for further involvement in the movement.

Given the relatively recent emergence of the movement, there exists very little scholarly research on media portrayals of the movement. In this article, I report findings from a qualitative examination of major newspaper portrayals of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement between April and August 2016, before the particularly divisive 2016 presidential election. Inductive textual analyses of 131 newspaper articles indicate that, although the movement\\u2019s goals were represented positively and from the perspective of members of the movement, the newspapers politicized and sensationalized the movement, and they focused far more on supposed negative consequences of the movement.

This movement led by young Blacks unapologetically calls out the shameful, historical legacy of American racism and White supremacy while asserting the humanity and sacredness of Black lives, particularly those of unarmed persons senselessly murdered by police officers. While Black Lives Matter is a new movement, it is also an extension of the 400-year struggle of Black people in America to affirm Black dignity, equality, and human rights, even while the major institutions of American society have propagated doctrines and enforced unjust rules\\/laws to denigrate Black life. Black Christians have found hope and inspiration from the Gospel to claim their humanity and to struggle to gain justice for Black lives and for the lives of all oppressed people. In addition, the Black Lives Matter movement provides a helpful critique of many Black churches, challenging them to confront their biases, which label young Black males as \\u201cthugs\\u201d (the new N-word) and which cruelly demonize the LGBTQ community. The story of Peter and Cornelius in Acts 10 provides a scriptural basis for Christian introspection and responses to God\\u2019s vision for beloved community, and for the call to action from the Black Lives Matter movement.

The content and style of these protests reflected both the national political issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement, and highly local and regional struggles over gentrification and displacement. In this article, I analyze these protests in relation to the regional political economy of the tech-industry, the real estate booms, and the attendant \\u2018eviction epidemic\\u2019 in the region. In doing so, I lay out an analysis of the relationship between policing and gentrification in the Black Lives Matter protests in the Bay Area. In the first section, I analyze the regional political economy as the context in which these protests must be understood. In a second section, I argue that the protests created a regional protest geography that, in turn, was met by a regionalized repressive security state. Finally, I read the disruptive practices deployed by these protests as a series of complex and sophisticated contestations which embodied connections among policing, gentrification, and the regional political economy. As such, the Black Lives Matter protests produced an intersectional analysis and can be read as a regional uprising aimed to disrupt the security state.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

The recent murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have prompted a national debate about the need to address systemic racism in policing within the United States. Recent studies have shown how racial resentment has spilled over into a wide range of political issues that are not associated with race; however, no current research examines how racial resentment might shape whites\\u2019 views toward Black Lives Matter. Employing the racial reaction theory and the 2016 American Election Study Survey, we hypothesize and confirm that whites with high levels of racial resentment, conservative ideology, and those who indicated support for Donald Trump hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement. Our results also show that Asians and Hispanics hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement, but that whites have the highest racial resentment levels. The results raise doubts about whether the recent shift in white public opinion is sustainable. Given that racial resentment is a predictor of support for Black Lives Matter, scholars and activists should approach white support for Black Lives Matter with caution because it is likely that increased racial resentment may lead to sustained white opposition to the movement.

In doing so, they can not only draw useful connections between the past and present but also lay the foundations for a more meaningful study of black radicalism and black resistance in the United States.

Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley\\u2019s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes\\u2019s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism. The issue at stake is how exemplary crime fictions make sense of, and critically interrogate, the relationship between race, violence and neoliberalism.

Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life\\u2014the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment\\u2014is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles\\u2014liberation, inspiration, and healing\\u2014to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life.

This experience is shared with an increasing number of young people in the developed North who are also grappling with issues of joblessness and political exclusion. This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people's needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change. However, they have not yet been able to effect systemic change. While profound social transformation takes time, this generation is still wrestling with how to move beyond street protest and have a lasting impact on politics and governance.

The movement, under the guiding framework of Black Lives Matter, has resulted in a national conversation on police brutality and racism, and the violent effects these have on the black body.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

In order to respond to this ambivalent situation, this article suggests a pairing between the work of James Baldwin and that of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. I will argue that we cannot fully appreciate the depths of what Baldwin called the \\u201csavage paradox\\u201d of race without the insights provided by Klein and object relations psychoanalysis.

This study investigates the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) youth living in Windsor, Ontario regarding their interactions with police. Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.

Examining punishment discourses intersectionally unearths profound, unequal distinctions when controlling for the variety of victims\\u2019 identities within the punishment regime. For example, trans women of color are likely to face the harshest of realties when confronted with the prospect of punishment. However, missing from much of the academic carceral literature is a critical perspective situated in racialized epistemic frameworks. If racialized individuals are more likely to be affected by punishment systems, then, certainly, they are the foremost experts on what those realities are like. The Black Lives Matter hashtag came about during the aftermath of the George Zimmerman non-verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and it helped to cultivate the organization which turned into a multiracial international movement in defense of Black dignity and humanity. While Black Lives Matter was initially inspired by police violence, it has expanded its reach to include causes beyond police malpractice and brutality. This special issue of The Prison Journal seeks to merge principles associated with Black Lives Matter (as noted on their website) with critical issues endemic to community reentry after incarceration and the racialized and gendered impediments it produces. The empirical pieces included are qualitative to reflect the epistemologies of the affected, as we believe that narratives more powerfully capture these hard-to-reach (or deviant in comparison to the norm) perspectives. This special issue includes articles that critically foreground the voices of formerly incarcerated citizens (including some who are mothers and fathers) and reentry service providers. Importantly, it provides suggestions for new directions in reimagining a more democratic and racially equitable society without current punishment regimes.

Donald Trump\\u2019s inauguration in January 2017 has magnified the escalating racial tension of recent years and has, at the same time, fueled several forms of social activism across the United States. Acting as the catalyst for Black Lives Matter, the assassination of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012 stirred the race question in the country as the Till lynching had similarly done fifty seven years before. At the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, the complex relations between race, class, and gender within the South helped to set the atmosphere for one of the starkest assassinations in US history. Till\\u2019s infamous murder soon gave rise to an empowering narrative among the African American community that not only contributed to putting an end to the voracious rule of Jim Crow in the US South but that, with the passage of time, has also become a banner of justice in the current fight against racism, as it seems that recent violent events resuscitate the latent white supremacist ghosts of one of the world\\u2019s most powerful nations. ; The research for this article was funded by the project USRACEBODY, PGC2018-095687-B-I00, AEI\\/ERDF, EU.

We suggest that community psychologists, advocates, and policymakers use perspectives and values embedded within Community Psychology in order to help combat this issue. This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values.

We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.

The in-your-face and unapologetic tone of today\\u2019s movement stands in contrast to romanticized narratives of the peaceful, nonviolent activism of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. The movement\\u2019s titular organization, Black Lives Matter, openly rejects respectability politics\\u2014the notion that individuals and groups must conform to the expectations of white mainstream norms to protect themselves from the harms of white racism and discrimination. In this article, we examine whether generational politics affect Black attitudes toward protest movements, focusing especially on the Black Lives Matter organization. We expect that protest politics are affected by generations of Black Americans who have been socialized in different eras of social and political advocacy with differing views about the actions that are acceptable for Black politics. Consistent with prior literature, we anticipate that generational differences in attitudes toward contestation, varying awareness about the political and social goals of new movements, differences in access to political information, and overall generational socialization toward respectability politics will all affect the degree to which Black Americans support the Movement for Black Lives. Using national-level data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), we find that prior theories of generational politics do not fully explain support for Black Lives Matter. Unexpectedly, we find that older generations of Black Americans are more supportive of the movement than younger generations of Black Americans. We do not find strong evidence of generational effects interacting with awareness of the movement, political opportunity structures, or respectability politics, which suggests the diminishing effects of generational differences along with traditional factors that influence support. Our results underscore the need for research on generational effects to consider the context of political socialization, which varies across generations.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, \\u201cBlack lives matter!\\u201d This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action. Note: UDP is a platform for voices to be heard. Therefore, this is a personal, self-reflection article for a specific population, and is not a reflection of the beliefs of UDP.

As a multiracial person committed to racial justice and sympathetic both to those pushing for recognition of multiracial identity and to those who worry such recognition may undermine larger movements, these are questions I have long grappled with both professionally and personally. Of course, multiracial lives matter-but do they constitute a sub-agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement, or is there an independent agenda the moniker \\\"Multiracial Lives Matter\\\" might represent? If the latter, is there a danger that such an agenda might be co-opted by other forces and used to further unintended purposes, such as the advancement of colorblindness? To the extent that agenda demands unique recognition of multiracial identity, how can it co-exist with broader identity-based racial justice movements?. ; 50 ; 719-724 ; 3   Lucas, Lauren Sudeall\"},{\"id\":\"2c2a20bf59410cf36f4dd50b627f559bbdff2f7cca7bb9814e4dc091977e5857\",\"content\":\"Black Lives Matter in Information Literacy The institutional racism addressed by the Black Lives Matter movement is encoded in many of the structures of academia, including academic libraries.

Recently, however, a widespread cognizance of this strategic miscalculation coupled with the precipitous rise of Islamophobia in the Trump era has younger descendants of Muslim immigrants identifying with the left, combating Islamophobia as a type of racism in intersectional solidarity with other social justice platforms like the Black Lives Matter movement ( blm ). Thus, when fundamental disagreements emerged at the ris conference in late 2016 over endorsing the non-profit blm entity, they sparked robust social media debates.

This article argues that memory practices on social media platforms provide minority groups with affordances that established archives do not. Therefore, I will analyze tweets, Tumblr posts and a YouTube video in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement in the USA. Social media platforms can act as alternative archives to institutionalized archives and related systems of knowledge and power. While traditional archives focus on the representation of events, memory practices on social media platforms can also stress structural and slow forms of violence and their embeddedness in the everyday, point to historical continuities and make memories travel, thus establishing transnational and transcultural networks of mnemonic entanglements.

The movement has greatly influenced the questioning of everyday landscapes and the role of official memory in the erection, maintenance, or removal of monuments and memorials. In this column, I shed light on these phenomena, and highlight the tensions that exist between the acknowledgement and removal of racist or problematic memorials and statues and the protection of historical monuments and cultural heritage more generally. A human rights approach to memorialization would be a step in the right direction, while recognizing that the imperatives of the present shape memorialization efforts. It calls on those in the human rights field to continue pressing for critical reflection and debate around racism and memory landscapes, and to call out and expose racism in all of its forms in order to bring about social change.

When other citizens and state institutions betray a lack of care and concern for black suffering, which in turn makes it impossible for those wrongs to be redressed, is it fair to ask blacks to enact \\u201cappropriate\\u201d democratic politics?

Restorative justice as a means to reclaim humanity Purpose Overwhelming evidence suggests that black lives have not and do not matter in the American workplace. In fact, disturbing themes of black labor dehumanization, exploitation and racial discrimination appear throughout history into the present-day workplace. Yet, curiously, organizations and organizational scholars largely ignore how racism and slavery have informed management practice (Cooke, 2003) and contemporary workplace racism. The authors address this gap, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a platform. BLM is a social justice movement created in response to the pervasive racism experienced by black people. The purpose of this paper is to accomplish five goals, which are summarized in the following sections. Design\\/methodology\\/approach First, the authors outline historical themes of black labor dehumanization, exploitation and racial discrimination, providing specific examples to illustrate these themes and discussing their contemporary workplace implications. Second, key challenges that may arise as organizations seek to make black lives matter in the workplace are discussed. Third, the authors provide examples of organizations where black lives have mattered as an inspiration for how workplaces can affirm the humanity and self-actualization of black people. Findings Fourth, the authors provide organizations with helpful tools to truly make black lives matter in the workplace, using restorative justice as a framework to remedy workplace racism. Finally, while the paper is largely focused on business organizations, as two management scholars, the authors felt compelled to briefly articulate how academic scholarship might be influenced if black lives truly mattered in management scholarship and management education. Originality\\/value This paper begins to articulate how black lives matter in the workplace. The goal is to intervene and upend the exploitation of black workers so that they are finally recognized for their worth and value and treated as such. The authors have provided historical context to illustrate that contemporary workplace racism is rooted in the historical exploitation of black people from enslavement to contemporary instances of labor exploitation. The authors offer a restorative justice framework as a mechanism to redress workplace racism, being careful to outline key challenges with implementing the framework. The authors concluded with steps that organizations may consider as they work to repair the harm of workplace racism and rebuild trust amongst employees. Specifically, the authors discuss the benefits of organizational interventions that provide intergroup contact with an emphasis on perspective taking, and present a case example and suggested key indicators that black lives matter in today\\u2019s workplace.

We can embrace the ways the field and each piece of literature simultaneously was and is. Importantly, we can think about what both African American literature and the course on this literature need to be in ways that focus on past, present, and future. For students, African American literature can be a living voice in a broader trajectory of civil and social death, de jure and de facto discrimination, and the struggle for social justice.

Purpose In this invited professional insight paper the author draws parallels between recent debates on racism, Black Lives Matter and related research in sport and cognate domains. Design\\/methodology\\/approach Drawing on Critical Race Theory (CRT) the paper contends that 1) sport is a contested site, 2) sport is a microcosm of society 3) \\u201crace\\u201d and everyday racism are central to our understanding of sport. It overlays this critique with a recognition of the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of racisms. Findings While the deaths of Black lives are being mourned it is argued that our attention can also become distracted by narrow manifestations of racism (overt). Such approaches leave key stakeholders efforts focused on the individual to the detriment of challenging systemic policies, practices and dispositions that entrench racism. The color-coded racism of past decades is still with us but in addition to this, our critiques and activism require continued surveillance of cultural, institutional and structural arrangements in the everyday that remain nebulous, complex and difficult to challenge. Research limitations\\/implications This is a viewpoint paper. The author draws on previous original empirical work and current insights to draw parallels between sport, Black Lives Matter and broader social contexts. Due to limitations in the extant literature in regard to the section on cycling and ethnicity, examples are drawn primarily from the US and UK. Practical implications This focus on sport and leisure past times demonstrates that the Black experience of \\u201crace\\u201d and racism transcends social boundaries and cannot be perceived as restricted to narrow social domains. Social implications Racisms are embedded in society and therefore its cultural products of which sport is a significant one should not be marginalised in antiracism efforts and activist scholarship. Originality\\/value This paper draws on the author's original published research and current insights. The paper makes a contribution to the development of critical race theorising to the sociology of sport, and broader ethnic and racial studies.

Rather, racism is endemic and pervasive in the UK context, manifesting at every level of policing. From stop and search, to deaths after police contact, the authors highlight long-standing and widespread racist disparities in UK policing. The authors therefore pierce through any delusions of UK \\u201cpost-racialism\\u201d in order to show that, as protesters have reminded us, \\u201cthe UK is not innocent\\u201d. Design\\/methodology\\/approach In this piece, the authors reflect on the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. Whilst the catalyst was the death of George Floyd in the United States, the authors explore what the protests mean in the UK context. To do so, the authors draw upon recent high-profile examples of police racism, before situating those events within a wider landscape of racist policing.

Purpose 2020 has proved to be a challenging year. In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, yet again, the USA has witnessed police brutality leading to the death of a Black man, George Floyd. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, founded in the US but now an international organisation which challenges white supremacy and deliberates harm against Black people, mobilised hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets across the globe. Increasingly, the protests focus not only on George Floyd's murder but also the continued failure to challenge the celebrity of those involved in the transatlantic slave trade and European imperialism. In this article, the author will contend that many organisations are now reexamining their association with these historical wrongs against Black Africa and its diaspora. Further, the author will contend but that the failure to highlight the role of Black chattel slavery and imperialism in the accumulation of economic, commercial and political benefits reaped by the global north is a source of shame not only for many firms and institutions but also for universities. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The author has reviewed the online media for the latest developments in response to Black Lives Matter's George Floyd campaign in 2020 and reviewed the literature on the link between European global ambition and its impact on the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa. Findings Internationally, there is a discernible change in outlook towards the importance of the evils of slavery and colonialism on the Black experience today. These small steps will require scholars to embark on a fresh reexamination of race, society and work. Originality\\/value For decades, the slave trade and colonialism were issues rarely raised in government, firms and business schools. This will inevitably change especially in those countries that are the main beneficiaries of Black chattel slavery and colonial exploitation. Much Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) practice is fundamentally tokenism. A root and branch reappraisal will be needed to create more effective EDI policy and practice in support of race equality and anti-racism.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group \\u2018allies\\u2019. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.

This article speaks to existential challenges facing Black people, predominantly of Caribbean descent, to live in what continues to be a White dominated and White entitled society.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term \\u201cNigerian Lives Matter.\\u201e They appropriated from \\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\\u201e the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans\\u2019 familiarity with America\\u2019s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era. performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019) Abimbola A.

The Dylan Yang case, in which a Hmong teen was convicted of murder for the stabbing of another boy, perceived to be black Latino, in an altercation at his home, demands comparative racialization analytics to gain perspective on the implementation of unequal justice. Unpacking the effects of the gangster stereotype, especially for Southeast Asian youth, we suggest how, despite the Asian American model minority trope, Hmong American boys have been racialized as monstrous thugs comparable (but not identical) to their black and Latino counterparts, and thus treated by law enforcement as suspects in need of \\u201ccataloging\\u201d as part of the school-to-prison pipeline.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.
