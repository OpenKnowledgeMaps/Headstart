The recent murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have prompted a national debate about the need to address systemic racism in policing within the United States. Recent studies have shown how racial resentment has spilled over into a wide range of political issues that are not associated with race; however, no current research examines how racial resentment might shape whites\\u2019 views toward Black Lives Matter. Employing the racial reaction theory and the 2016 American Election Study Survey, we hypothesize and confirm that whites with high levels of racial resentment, conservative ideology, and those who indicated support for Donald Trump hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement. Our results also show that Asians and Hispanics hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement, but that whites have the highest racial resentment levels. The results raise doubts about whether the recent shift in white public opinion is sustainable. Given that racial resentment is a predictor of support for Black Lives Matter, scholars and activists should approach white support for Black Lives Matter with caution because it is likely that increased racial resentment may lead to sustained white opposition to the movement.\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 4, page 496-515 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Riley, Emmitt Y.; Peterson, Clarissa\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.496\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8d49c339c9cdfbc307b6b905d222f240f4fe507f2ebd8cf98b5981a8c27301ab\",\"relevance\":111},{\"id\":\"3628a175d69110ba2eff807b50a84c1227a21edcef81915ce3577f6c3635317b\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18562; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p55\",\"title\":\"\\u201cI believe in that movement and I believe in that chant\\u201d: The influence of Black Lives Matter on resilience and empowerment\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Over the past few years, systemic racism has been increasingly in the news via the work of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 55-72 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley\\u2019s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes\\u2019s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism.

As such, the physical context for African American life\\u2014the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment\\u2014is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles\\u2014liberation, inspiration, and healing\\u2014to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life. Appealing to the Smithsonian\\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture as an example, this paper articulates the possibilities of architectural projects to symbolically and practically support liberative goals in African American religious systems and political movements.\",\"published_in\":\"Religions, Vol 8, Iss 12, p 256 (2017)\",\"year\":\"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"African American religion; African American spirituality; Black Lives Matter; architecture; built environment; womanist ethics; ecowomanism; liberation theology; social justice; National Museum of African American History and Culture; Religions.

This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 85-100 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective, Vol 4, Iss 2, Pp 55-72 (2018)\",\"year\":\"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Racism; Empowerment; Resilience; Black Lives Matter; Philosophy.

This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people's needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change. However, they have not yet been able to effect systemic change.

I will argue that we cannot fully appreciate the depths of what Baldwin called the \\u201csavage paradox\\u201d of race without the insights provided by Klein and object relations psychoanalysis. Conversely, Baldwin helps us to sound out the political significance of object relations approaches, including the work of Klein and those influenced by her such as Hanna Segal and Wilfred Bion.

The in-your-face and unapologetic tone of today\\u2019s movement stands in contrast to romanticized narratives of the peaceful, nonviolent activism of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. The movement\\u2019s titular organization, Black Lives Matter, openly rejects respectability politics\\u2014the notion that individuals and groups must conform to the expectations of white mainstream norms to protect themselves from the harms of white racism and discrimination. In this article, we examine whether generational politics affect Black attitudes toward protest movements, focusing especially on the Black Lives Matter organization. We expect that protest politics are affected by generations of Black Americans who have been socialized in different eras of social and political advocacy with differing views about the actions that are acceptable for Black politics. Consistent with prior literature, we anticipate that generational differences in attitudes toward contestation, varying awareness about the political and social goals of new movements, differences in access to political information, and overall generational socialization toward respectability politics will all affect the degree to which Black Americans support the Movement for Black Lives. Using national-level data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), we find that prior theories of generational politics do not fully explain support for Black Lives Matter. Unexpectedly, we find that older generations of Black Americans are more supportive of the movement than younger generations of Black Americans. We do not find strong evidence of generational effects interacting with awareness of the movement, political opportunity structures, or respectability politics, which suggests the diminishing effects of generational differences along with traditional factors that influence support. Our results underscore the need for research on generational effects to consider the context of political socialization, which varies across generations.\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 4, page 452-473 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Board, Marcus; Spry, Amber; Nunnally, Shayla C.; Sinclair-Chapman, Valeria\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.4.452\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"f36576fcbb284d31e0762131a50470ea0dd7a9215501fc813ca75cdfbf88bc1f\",\"relevance\":85},{\"id\":\"18df51364b32d709e43f65aad3bcd404dec030bd3ec7c51ac99fd4db235321bc\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018; hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; doi:10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization ; Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization: An interview with Melina Abdullah by Yohann Le Moigne\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Melina Abdullah is a scholar-activist.

Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 101-118 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Examining punishment discourses intersectionally unearths profound, unequal distinctions when controlling for the variety of victims\\u2019 identities within the punishment regime. For example, trans women of color are likely to face the harshest of realties when confronted with the prospect of punishment. However, missing from much of the academic carceral literature is a critical perspective situated in racialized epistemic frameworks. If racialized individuals are more likely to be affected by punishment systems, then, certainly, they are the foremost experts on what those realities are like. The Black Lives Matter hashtag came about during the aftermath of the George Zimmerman non-verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and it helped to cultivate the organization which turned into a multiracial international movement in defense of Black dignity and humanity. While Black Lives Matter was initially inspired by police violence, it has expanded its reach to include causes beyond police malpractice and brutality. This special issue of The Prison Journal seeks to merge principles associated with Black Lives Matter (as noted on their website) with critical issues endemic to community reentry after incarceration and the racialized and gendered impediments it produces. The empirical pieces included are qualitative to reflect the epistemologies of the affected, as we believe that narratives more powerfully capture these hard-to-reach (or deviant in comparison to the norm) perspectives. This special issue includes articles that critically foreground the voices of formerly incarcerated citizens (including some who are mothers and fathers) and reentry service providers. Importantly, it provides suggestions for new directions in reimagining a more democratic and racially equitable society without current punishment regimes.\",\"published_in\":\"The Prison Journal ; volume 99, issue 4, page 387-395 ; ISSN 0032-8855 1552-7522\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"subject\":\"Social Sciences (miscellaneous); Law\",\"authors\":\"Williams, Jason M.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0032885519852062\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"74b72e1d9a4950d23d453a8843b22093190bb2b0c1ab34a47a03dda9575e6048\",\"relevance\":80},{\"id\":\"df71284e92e4c9f53130e95a80e610fda424aa86be00212b076c0bac9b93dd90\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018; hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; doi:10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization ; Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization: An interview with Melina Abdullah by Yohann Le Moigne\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Melina Abdullah is a scholar-activist.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, \\u201cBlack lives matter!\\u201d This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action. Note: UDP is a platform for voices to be heard. Therefore, this is a personal, self-reflection article for a specific population, and is not a reflection of the beliefs of UDP.\",\"published_in\":\"Understanding and Dismantling Privilege; Vol 7 No 1 (2017): UNDERSTANDING AND DISMANTLING PRIVILEGE; 53-65 ; 2152-1875\",\"year\":\"2017-04-29\",\"subject_orig\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"subject\":\"Catholicism; Black Lives Matter; White privilege; Exodus; Tradition; Tactics\",\"authors\":\"Harper, Matt\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wpcjournal.com\\/article\\/view\\/16458\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"1fd7689619b8b0b8d201792590461cacf4c354bbeb31bb1b1fab6da9f303cdef\",\"relevance\":78},{\"id\":\"2d5cec540056e4fd46e29e6ecbda95c864e2ea8119b474d7d48fe681ee778dd3\",\"relation\":\"info:eu-repo\\/semantics\\/altIdentifier\\/doi\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018; hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; doi:10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/hal.univ-angers.fr\\/hal-02384404; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3917\\/rfea.152.0018\",\"title\":\"Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization ; Black Lives Matter, Obama, and the Future of Black Mobilization: An interview with Melina Abdullah by Yohann Le Moigne\",\"paper_abstract\":\"International audience ; Melina Abdullah is a scholar-activist.

This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.\",\"published_in\":\"Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 9-21 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

This paper analyzes those inter-communal negotiations as they played out on the Facebook pages of Muslim scholars, associating discourse models with contestations of community members negotiating the boundaries involved with integrating the heterogeneous discourses of antiracism.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Religion, Media and Digital Culture ; volume 7, issue 1, page 67-89 ; ISSN 2588-8099 2165-9214\",\"year\":\"2018\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Latif, Jibril\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1163\\/25888099-00701005\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"c5ab71134bb8c18477ec66903b2a9e02493cb0285bb82fbce422688774555a36\",\"relevance\":61},{\"id\":\"309f8a6a5f62bbd9502e86a012c2ede02a22b20b1b91067670a8055f94758eee\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/radicalteacher.library.pitt.edu\\/ojs\\/index.php\\/radicalteacher\\/article\\/view\\/340; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1941-0832; 1941-0832; doi:10.5195\\/rt.2016.340; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3c9cc3fa0ff0478fa8b591c7ec839f1f\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5195\\/rt.2016.340; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/3c9cc3fa0ff0478fa8b591c7ec839f1f\",\"title\":\"Introduction: Teaching Black Lives Matter\",\"paper_abstract\":\"An introduction to Radical Teacher, Issue 106: Teaching Black Lives Matter.

The Dylan Yang case, in which a Hmong teen was convicted of murder for the stabbing of another boy, perceived to be black Latino, in an altercation at his home, demands comparative racialization analytics to gain perspective on the implementation of unequal justice. Unpacking the effects of the gangster stereotype, especially for Southeast Asian youth, we suggest how, despite the Asian American model minority trope, Hmong American boys have been racialized as monstrous thugs comparable (but not identical) to their black and Latino counterparts, and thus treated by law enforcement as suspects in need of \\u201ccataloging\\u201d as part of the school-to-prison pipeline.

In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, yet again, the USA has witnessed police brutality leading to the death of a Black man, George Floyd. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, founded in the US but now an international organisation which challenges white supremacy and deliberates harm against Black people, mobilised hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets across the globe. Increasingly, the protests focus not only on George Floyd's murder but also the continued failure to challenge the celebrity of those involved in the transatlantic slave trade and European imperialism. In this article, the author will contend that many organisations are now reexamining their association with these historical wrongs against Black Africa and its diaspora. Further, the author will contend but that the failure to highlight the role of Black chattel slavery and imperialism in the accumulation of economic, commercial and political benefits reaped by the global north is a source of shame not only for many firms and institutions but also for universities. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The author has reviewed the online media for the latest developments in response to Black Lives Matter's George Floyd campaign in 2020 and reviewed the literature on the link between European global ambition and its impact on the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa. Findings Internationally, there is a discernible change in outlook towards the importance of the evils of slavery and colonialism on the Black experience today. These small steps will require scholars to embark on a fresh reexamination of race, society and work. Originality\\/value For decades, the slave trade and colonialism were issues rarely raised in government, firms and business schools. This will inevitably change especially in those countries that are the main beneficiaries of Black chattel slavery and colonial exploitation.

Design\\/methodology\\/approach Drawing on Critical Race Theory (CRT) the paper contends that 1) sport is a contested site, 2) sport is a microcosm of society 3) \\u201crace\\u201d and everyday racism are central to our understanding of sport. It overlays this critique with a recognition of the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of racisms. Findings While the deaths of Black lives are being mourned it is argued that our attention can also become distracted by narrow manifestations of racism (overt). Such approaches leave key stakeholders efforts focused on the individual to the detriment of challenging systemic policies, practices and dispositions that entrench racism. The color-coded racism of past decades is still with us but in addition to this, our critiques and activism require continued surveillance of cultural, institutional and structural arrangements in the everyday that remain nebulous, complex and difficult to challenge. Research limitations\\/implications This is a viewpoint paper. The author draws on previous original empirical work and current insights to draw parallels between sport, Black Lives Matter and broader social contexts. Due to limitations in the extant literature in regard to the section on cycling and ethnicity, examples are drawn primarily from the US and UK. Practical implications This focus on sport and leisure past times demonstrates that the Black experience of \\u201crace\\u201d and racism transcends social boundaries and cannot be perceived as restricted to narrow social domains. Social implications Racisms are embedded in society and therefore its cultural products of which sport is a significant one should not be marginalised in antiracism efforts and activist scholarship. Originality\\/value This paper draws on the author's original published research and current insights. The paper makes a contribution to the development of critical race theorising to the sociology of sport, and broader ethnic and racial studies.\",\"published_in\":\"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal ; volume ahead-of-print, issue ahead-of-print ; ISSN 2040-7149\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sociology and Political Science; Gender Studies\",\"subject\":\"Sociology and Political Science; Gender Studies\",\"authors\":\"Hylton, Kevin\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/edi-07-2020-0185\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"5d4130e423ca28ee72de74fefa9844d988c1a345c4423f9f9ca9f8123f9546fd\",\"relevance\":36},{\"id\":\"0566af86997ee8f4179c045a4c50b71c0caacc16aa77e9142a8adcedca2bf559\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1108\\/edi-06-2020-0170; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/EDI-06-2020-0170\\/full\\/xml; https:\\/\\/www.emerald.com\\/insight\\/content\\/doi\\/10.1108\\/EDI-06-2020-0170\\/full\\/html\",\"title\":\"\\u201cThe UK is not innocent\\u201d: Black Lives Matter, policing and abolition in the UK\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Purpose The purpose of this article is to show that racism is not only a US problem. Rather, racism is endemic and pervasive in the UK context, manifesting at every level of policing. From stop and search, to deaths after police contact, the authors highlight long-standing and widespread racist disparities in UK policing.

Whilst the catalyst was the death of George Floyd in the United States, the authors explore what the protests mean in the UK context. To do so, the authors draw upon recent high-profile examples of police racism, before situating those events within a wider landscape of racist policing.

This theological base has created the frameworks that have dictated the sematic belief that Black bodies do not really matter and if they do, then they are invariably second-class ones when compared to White bodies.

However, social media activity can fulfil a variety of different functions for social change. In particular, the rhetorical functions of social media use by social movements are not well understood. We address this shortfall by analysing the rhetorical functions of Twitter use during an early stage of the Black Lives Matter social movement. We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group \\u2018allies\\u2019. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2019-10-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Wilkins, D.J.; Livingstone, A.G.; Levine, M.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\\/id\\/eprint\\/131987\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"32938a80f4029cdcf71c763386d7e4839fda6eb77fe62058e9b530e0e96b7391\",\"relevance\":33},{\"id\":\"e50337a68a24b3069bfb277f497decb054212d911d7f24ffedcca5c6fed00975\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/siba-ese.unile.it\\/index.php\\/cpgp\\/article\\/view\\/18707; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1285\\/i24212113v4i2p73\",\"title\":\"#APIsforBlackLives: Unpacking the interracial discourse on the Asian American Pacific Islander and Black communities\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this paper we use the Ecological Metaphor to illustrate a complex and multilayered picture of the relationship between Black and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities, exploring how different forces operate when two marginalized communities interact within an oppressive system.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term \\u201cNigerian Lives Matter.\\u201e They appropriated from \\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\\u201e the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans\\u2019 familiarity with America\\u2019s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era.\",\"published_in\":\"Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019)\",\"year\":\"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"subject\":\"performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H\",\"authors\":\"Abimbola A.

This study explores the factors that lead to an avenue for allyship from the Latino community to the Black community. Using attitudes about the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, a series of hypotheses are tested to examine the structure of Latino-Black compared to white-Black coalitions. Two major findings emerge from the analysis; first, differences between whites and Latinos reveal that the effect of harboring anti-Black stereotypes are extraordinarily predictive of rejecting calls for racial social justice and combatting the scourge of police killings of unarmed Black men among whites but not among Latinos. Second, differences according to Latino racial identity and indicators of acculturation also impact support for the BLM movement in ways that both reaffirm but also challenge previous scholarship. These results suggest that while on the whole Latinos, and especially immigrants, are uninformed about BLM, once aware they exhibit a generally supportive stance toward the movement\\u2019s goals of criminal justice reform.\",\"published_in\":\"Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences ; volume 42, issue 4, page 431-454 ; ISSN 0739-9863 1552-6364\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Linguistics and Language; Cultural Studies; Social Psychology; Anthropology\",\"subject\":\"Linguistics and Language; Cultural Studies; Social Psychology; Anthropology\",\"authors\":\"Corral, \\u00c1lvaro J.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1177\\/0739986320949540\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"5a9e244d521551f706e7fae0aff1672b00c3b0af1397c0b86b2989160f9db4a9\",\"relevance\":21},{\"id\":\"523c99ffc0c9009ef76302a133567acbe1ca2baf5ba603d17340671d417c8f25\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25158\\/L7.2.16; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2469-4053; 2469-4053; doi:10.25158\\/L7.2.16; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/97f6b016b2e84b23995108499f8571df\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.25158\\/L7.2.16; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/97f6b016b2e84b23995108499f8571df\",\"title\":\"Review of \\\"Reality Bites: Rhetoric and the Circulation of Truth Claims in U.S. Political Culture\\\" by Dana Cloud (Ohio State University Press)\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Dana Cloud\\u2019s marvelous new book provides just the sort of deep understanding and practical guidance needed for thoughtful and effective political engagement in the Trump era.

The second key finding is that BLM organizations generated more tweets that framed the movement as a struggle for individual rights than ones that utilized frames about gender, racial, and LGBTQ identities. Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists urge their followers to pursue disruptive repertoires of contention less frequently than they encourage other political behaviors. These findings suggest that the BLM movement is intelligible through both the resource mobilization and new social movement paradigms within social movement studies.\",\"published_in\":\"The Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics ; volume 4, issue 2, page 297-323 ; ISSN 2056-6085\",\"year\":\"2019\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Tillery, Alvin B.\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1017\\/rep.2019.17\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"69176a7250e8e1232196b47dec5c792c43a29d7444138e30eb0b022e55793878\",\"relevance\":16},{\"id\":\"cb35a5cf9d8daed1b1253c6166d9fa7bae856943608ee2f679950792356cfbf5\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/sf\\/soaa064; http:\\/\\/academic.oup.com\\/sf\\/advance-article-pdf\\/doi\\/10.1093\\/sf\\/soaa064\\/33466090\\/soaa064.pdf\",\"title\":\"Evaluating the Mobilization Effect of Online Political Network Structures: A Comparison between the Black Lives Matter Network and Ideal Type Network Configurations\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Do online networks encourage political participation? Much research has theorized on how digital networks transmit mobilizing content, fewer studies examine the structure of online networks, and even fewer test how the structure of online networks affects participation for political behaviors with differing costs. From a structural network perspective, I highlight the puzzle: If according to recent literature, digital networks are loose with many weak ties, how can such a network configuration facilitate high-cost political behavior that requires multiple social reinforcements? I map the following relationships among 655 Twitter users who follow the Black Lives Matter Sacramento chapter and compare the structure of the digital network to three commonly observed ideal type networks. The results show that the digital network is structurally distinct from the ideal types, as it is characterized by an extremely dense cluster but also with many loosely connected components, which I describe as a \\u201ccluster-connective network.\\u201d Results from computer experiments further show that paradoxically, this \\u201ccluster-connective\\u201d configuration benefits participation for high-cost behavior but hinders participation for low-cost behavior. The results illustrate how a structural network perspective helps scholars move from the question of whether digital networks facilitate participation to the conditions under which digital networks encourage participation.\",\"published_in\":\"Social Forces ; ISSN 0037-7732 1534-7605\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"Sociology and Political Science; History; Anthropology\",\"subject\":\"Sociology and Political Science; History; Anthropology\",\"authors\":\"Hsiao, Yuan\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1093\\/sf\\/soaa064\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"cb35a5cf9d8daed1b1253c6166d9fa7bae856943608ee2f679950792356cfbf5\",\"relevance\":15},{\"id\":\"bcefa1242cfc9058e42c3130b783d68c82521b49934eedc0b16d02fc7ac2460e\",\"relation\":\"\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.2.311; http:\\/\\/online.ucpress.edu\\/nrbp\\/article-pdf\\/1\\/2\\/311\\/393594\\/nrbp.2020.1.2.311.pdf\",\"title\":\"The White Response to Black Lives Matter and Mike Brown\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Using the year 2015 to frame and contextualize the discussion, this article asks why white backlash is an expected reaction to black resistance. In short, white backlash is built into the liberal construction of race. Utilizing Joel Olson\\u2019s conception of Herrenvolk democracy, this article analyzes how the color-blind norm of race moves race into a sphere of discourse where it is omnipresent but also disempowered for any legal remedy. Policing becomes an institution by which race is made apparent, as the inequitable treatment by the police dictates who is protected by the color line. Drawn from polling surveys and government reports, data is provided with regard to the unchanging perceptions of racial attitudes. Black Lives Matter takes up the Black radical tradition in order to reassert Black humanity in the face of a system that normalizes racial violence, racial terror, and its own racial ignorance. In this way BLM displays the counternarrative to white hegemony. This counternarrative forces us to realize the depth of the race problem by mobilizing a language of abolition. Circling back to Olson\\u2019s abolition democracy, this article concludes by looking at how far we must go in terms of applying abolition to our discourse, language, conception of humanity, and democracy.\",\"published_in\":\"National Review of Black Politics ; volume 1, issue 2, page 311-323 ; ISSN 2688-0105 2688-0113\",\"year\":\"2020\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Briscoe, Chaz\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dx.doi.org\\/10.1525\\/nrbp.2020.1.2.311\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"bcefa1242cfc9058e42c3130b783d68c82521b49934eedc0b16d02fc7ac2460e\",\"relevance\":14},{\"id\":\"0ea49bb6adc33641fac33057ada839f1b69d06bdace6751884ab4597c1ae9ceb\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/2077-1444\\/8\\/11\\/255; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/2077-1444; 2077-1444; doi:10.3390\\/rel8110255; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2641577e1a974336b7bc301ec4a594a2\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/rel8110255; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/2641577e1a974336b7bc301ec4a594a2\",\"title\":\"#BlackBabiesMatter: Analyzing Black Religious Media in Conservative and Progressive Evangelical Communities\",\"paper_abstract\":\"This article explores how conservative and progressive black Protestants interrogate the theological theme of the sacrality of black life through digital media.

White supremacists and White nationalists did not hide their racist ideologies as they demanded that their privileged place in history not be erased. The BLM movement, which challenges state-sanctioned anti-Black racism, was ready to confront themes of White discontent and reverse racism, critiques of political correctness, and the assumption that racialized people should know their place and be content to be the subordinate other.It is easy to frame the events in Charlottesville as indicative of US-specific race problems. However, a sense that White spaces should prevail and an ongoing history of anti-Black racism are not unique to the United States. The rise of Canadian activism under the BLM banner also signals a movement to change Canadian forms of institutional racism in policing, education, and the labor market.

What is the role of linked fate in galvanizing support around these marginalized Blacks?

Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population.

The recent murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor have prompted a national debate about the need to address systemic racism in policing within the United States. Recent studies have shown how racial resentment has spilled over into a wide range of political issues that are not associated with race; however, no current research examines how racial resentment might shape whites\\u2019 views toward Black Lives Matter. Employing the racial reaction theory and the 2016 American Election Study Survey, we hypothesize and confirm that whites with high levels of racial resentment, conservative ideology, and those who indicated support for Donald Trump hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement. Our results also show that Asians and Hispanics hold negative attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement, but that whites have the highest racial resentment levels. The results raise doubts about whether the recent shift in white public opinion is sustainable. Given that racial resentment is a predictor of support for Black Lives Matter, scholars and activists should approach white support for Black Lives Matter with caution because it is likely that increased racial resentment may lead to sustained white opposition to the movement.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

By analyzing the movement\\u2019s explicit refusal to be likened to civil rights movement organizations as a concurrent attack against intraracial sexism, heterosexism, and transphobia, the article insists that BLM deprivileges heteronormativity to show that black freedom dreams must include gender and sexual liberation. By considering BLM\\u2019s rejection of capitalism as a broader critique of neoliberalism\\u2019s forceful role in maintaining black dispossession, the author posits that BLM desires to disrupt the state\\u2019s tendency to use the black middle class to enact, enforce, and reinforce an economic order that relies upon race and racism to codify and cement black inequality. Finally, the author posits that the movement\\u2019s tactics and goals provide a framework through which to enact short-term change, while pushing to dismantle the larger system of antiblack racism that is refracted through global capitalism.

Crime fiction is well-placed to offer insight into the problem of race, drugs, poverty and policing but by paying close attention to The Wire, Walter Mosley\\u2019s Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Chester Himes\\u2019s Plan B, I argue that the issue of depicting police violence in a form where the law must also be validated and of accommodating the destructive potentiality of black political violence in a form narratively orientated towards rational explanation and resolution requires very careful consideration. What is different about our contemporary moment is not simply that young black men are being killed by the police or that violent retaliation inevitably follows but rather that these circumstances are also tied to the precariousness experienced by poor black people under neoliberalism. The issue at stake is how exemplary crime fictions make sense of, and critically interrogate, the relationship between race, violence and neoliberalism.

Activists within the movement join traditional forms of social protest and policy development with rituals and spiritual practices, drawing upon spiritual resources as a source of transformation and empowerment. The transformative aims of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements address critical areas for reform, like criminal justice, education, and public health, but their vision for reform is broad and extensive, envisioning the creation of a more just world. As such, the physical context for African American life\\u2014the buildings and public spaces known as the built environment\\u2014is a crucial aspect of social transformation. This essay examines the spirituality of Black Lives Matter and other contemporary African American justice movements and considers how it inspires the ongoing transformation of buildings and public spaces. By analyzing the spiritual practices and themes in the Black Lives Matter movement as described by its founders, this paper identifies three principles and relates them to similar concepts in African American religious thought, womanist ethics, and ecowomanism. Applying these three spiritual principles\\u2014liberation, inspiration, and healing\\u2014to the design of architecture and public spaces can enrich and affirm African American life. Appealing to the Smithsonian\\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture as an example, this paper articulates the possibilities of architectural projects to symbolically and practically support liberative goals in African American religious systems and political movements.

Notably, BLM also highlighted and uplifted issues facing Black women. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

While the negative psychological effects of racial discrimination are well documented, less is known about how young people resist or change racism, and how social movements such as BLM may influence these individual processes. To address this gap, the current study used the Transconceptual Model of Empowerment and Resilience (TMER; Brodsky & Cattaneo, 2013) to explore how BLM operates to support, promote, and maintain resilience and empowerment processes among young Black men as they face racism. Semi-structured interviews with 14 young Black men were analyzed using an issue-focused analysis approach. The findings suggest that participants experienced a diverse range of racism. The BLM movement appeared to influence resilience and empowerment by: 1) providing awareness about racial injustice, 2) reinforcing racial pride, 3) offering resources, and 4) opening a window of opportunity for participants to enact change within their local context.

This experience is shared with an increasing number of young people in the developed North who are also grappling with issues of joblessness and political exclusion. This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people's needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change. However, they have not yet been able to effect systemic change. While profound social transformation takes time, this generation is still wrestling with how to move beyond street protest and have a lasting impact on politics and governance.

In order to respond to this ambivalent situation, this article suggests a pairing between the work of James Baldwin and that of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. I will argue that we cannot fully appreciate the depths of what Baldwin called the \\u201csavage paradox\\u201d of race without the insights provided by Klein and object relations psychoanalysis. Conversely, Baldwin helps us to sound out the political significance of object relations approaches, including the work of Klein and those influenced by her such as Hanna Segal and Wilfred Bion.

The movement, under the guiding framework of Black Lives Matter, has resulted in a national conversation on police brutality and racism, and the violent effects these have on the black body. Using the framework of black theological thought on the body, this paper identifies the many ways that racism, as Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153lands, with great violence, upon the body\\u00e2\\u20ac across multiple domains and levels throughout history and across the life course.

The in-your-face and unapologetic tone of today\\u2019s movement stands in contrast to romanticized narratives of the peaceful, nonviolent activism of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement. The movement\\u2019s titular organization, Black Lives Matter, openly rejects respectability politics\\u2014the notion that individuals and groups must conform to the expectations of white mainstream norms to protect themselves from the harms of white racism and discrimination. In this article, we examine whether generational politics affect Black attitudes toward protest movements, focusing especially on the Black Lives Matter organization. We expect that protest politics are affected by generations of Black Americans who have been socialized in different eras of social and political advocacy with differing views about the actions that are acceptable for Black politics. Consistent with prior literature, we anticipate that generational differences in attitudes toward contestation, varying awareness about the political and social goals of new movements, differences in access to political information, and overall generational socialization toward respectability politics will all affect the degree to which Black Americans support the Movement for Black Lives. Using national-level data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), we find that prior theories of generational politics do not fully explain support for Black Lives Matter. Unexpectedly, we find that older generations of Black Americans are more supportive of the movement than younger generations of Black Americans. We do not find strong evidence of generational effects interacting with awareness of the movement, political opportunity structures, or respectability politics, which suggests the diminishing effects of generational differences along with traditional factors that influence support. Our results underscore the need for research on generational effects to consider the context of political socialization, which varies across generations.

This study investigates the perspectives of African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) youth living in Windsor, Ontario regarding their interactions with police. Twelve ACB youth were recruited using various methods through the Promoting and Owning Empowerment and Resilience among African, Caribbean, and Black Youth in Windsor (POWER) project to take part in focus group interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis in NVIVO 10 software. Themes included a belief that police have positive effects on society, and that only a certain minority of officers are responsible for misconduct; many interactions with youth are not the fault of the officer(s) involved and that police institutions play an important role in society. However, youth also expressed reasons for their displeasure with these institutions, such as: the lack of diversity within the police force, and that police sometimes abuse power and can be aggressive. Moreover, police have obstructed justice, profiled, and treated ACB people differently, according to participants. These results come at a time when community advocacy groups, such as Black Lives Matter, are mobilizing to improve the experiences of African diasporic people in Canadian society.

Examining punishment discourses intersectionally unearths profound, unequal distinctions when controlling for the variety of victims\\u2019 identities within the punishment regime. For example, trans women of color are likely to face the harshest of realties when confronted with the prospect of punishment. However, missing from much of the academic carceral literature is a critical perspective situated in racialized epistemic frameworks. If racialized individuals are more likely to be affected by punishment systems, then, certainly, they are the foremost experts on what those realities are like. The Black Lives Matter hashtag came about during the aftermath of the George Zimmerman non-verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, and it helped to cultivate the organization which turned into a multiracial international movement in defense of Black dignity and humanity. While Black Lives Matter was initially inspired by police violence, it has expanded its reach to include causes beyond police malpractice and brutality. This special issue of The Prison Journal seeks to merge principles associated with Black Lives Matter (as noted on their website) with critical issues endemic to community reentry after incarceration and the racialized and gendered impediments it produces. The empirical pieces included are qualitative to reflect the epistemologies of the affected, as we believe that narratives more powerfully capture these hard-to-reach (or deviant in comparison to the norm) perspectives. This special issue includes articles that critically foreground the voices of formerly incarcerated citizens (including some who are mothers and fathers) and reentry service providers. Importantly, it provides suggestions for new directions in reimagining a more democratic and racially equitable society without current punishment regimes.

Equally clear is the choice many churches and congregants make today to remain silent and inert when it comes to prioritizing the dignity of all marginalized populations, even those sitting beside them in the pews. Specifically, the White, Catholic community of faith is significantly absent in the work to challenge institutions that oppose the liberation of Black communities. However, this reality is inconsistent with the most faithful demands of Catholic scripture and tradition. From the Old Testament to Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles to Pope Francis, one core principle of Catholicism is the priority God places on the lives and dignity of the most oppressed. By exploring the compendium of Catholicism, White Catholics can find an appropriate framework for considering how to engage the work for racial justice. Additionally, those of White identity have a unique responsibility to explore the realities of their racial identity. By taking intentional action and heeding the call that so many others before them have taken up, they can find that it is very much in the lexicon of God to loudly proclaim the Gospel truth, \\u201cBlack lives matter!\\u201d This is a personal self-reflection, and I envision the primary audience for this article to be privileged White Catholics who impose their social and political beliefs about the Black Lives Matter movement on their faith. The aim is to provide pushback to those who would argue that this social movement, along with others, is contrary to the Catholic faith and hopefully serve as a call to embolden them to action. Note: UDP is a platform for voices to be heard. Therefore, this is a personal, self-reflection article for a specific population, and is not a reflection of the beliefs of UDP.

We suggest that community psychologists, advocates, and policymakers use perspectives and values embedded within Community Psychology in order to help combat this issue. This includes: 1) taking an ecological approach to understanding the context that contributes to and maintains systems of racial inequality, 2) use Community Psychology values such as sense of community and respect for diversity to address the problem. However, inherent paradoxical issues, such as, the community-diversity dialectic (Neal & Neal, 2014), arise when integrating core Community Psychology values. This potential roadblock on the journey to using Community Psychology to advance this social justice issue must be overcome. We describe what this dialectic entails and provide an example of an organization of advocates, The Black Lives Matter movement, which effectively uses Community Psychology values, methods, and perspectives to overcome the community-diversity dialectic and lead efforts aimed towards addressing this social issue.

The proliferation of social media and smart technology has allowed the recording, documenting, and archiving of police misconduct and brutality against Black bodies. Furthermore, BLM is critical of various institutions that create disparities, including the criminal justice system. This article examines the nexus of BLM and prisoner reentry. Using qualitative research conducted in the weeks and months following the death of Trayvon Martin in February 2012, a collective of formerly incarcerated and recently released Black men discussed and analyzed this death and its impact on the Black community. Here, these individuals shared their ideas surrounding punishment and justice as well as reflected on their own past, present, and future roles in their community.

The author draws upon ethnographic methods in order to demonstrate that the public moral critique of the movement is embedded in four interlocking narratives, and to interrogate the Catholic theological discipline itself as an object of this moral critique in light of its own performative habituation to whiteness.

Social media platforms can act as alternative archives to institutionalized archives and related systems of knowledge and power. While traditional archives focus on the representation of events, memory practices on social media platforms can also stress structural and slow forms of violence and their embeddedness in the everyday, point to historical continuities and make memories travel, thus establishing transnational and transcultural networks of mnemonic entanglements.

Recently, however, a widespread cognizance of this strategic miscalculation coupled with the precipitous rise of Islamophobia in the Trump era has younger descendants of Muslim immigrants identifying with the left, combating Islamophobia as a type of racism in intersectional solidarity with other social justice platforms like the Black Lives Matter movement ( blm ).

The movement has greatly influenced the questioning of everyday landscapes and the role of official memory in the erection, maintenance, or removal of monuments and memorials. In this column, I shed light on these phenomena, and highlight the tensions that exist between the acknowledgement and removal of racist or problematic memorials and statues and the protection of historical monuments and cultural heritage more generally. A human rights approach to memorialization would be a step in the right direction, while recognizing that the imperatives of the present shape memorialization efforts. It calls on those in the human rights field to continue pressing for critical reflection and debate around racism and memory landscapes, and to call out and expose racism in all of its forms in order to bring about social change.

The Dylan Yang case, in which a Hmong teen was convicted of murder for the stabbing of another boy, perceived to be black Latino, in an altercation at his home, demands comparative racialization analytics to gain perspective on the implementation of unequal justice. Unpacking the effects of the gangster stereotype, especially for Southeast Asian youth, we suggest how, despite the Asian American model minority trope, Hmong American boys have been racialized as monstrous thugs comparable (but not identical) to their black and Latino counterparts, and thus treated by law enforcement as suspects in need of \\u201ccataloging\\u201d as part of the school-to-prison pipeline.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that Black women are at-risk for cardiovascular disease, maternal and infant mortality, breast cancer, and mental health symptoms. This paper seeks to argue that the BLM movement is a critical site for radical transformation for raising critical consciousness. In focusing on the well-being of Black people, BLM puts forth a framework of healing justice that employs an anti-racist, intersectional, holistic, and culturally and politically appropriate informed therapeutic approach. This framework addresses the historical and contemporary trauma that Black people have and continue to experience in the U.S. This paper asserts that this framework can cultivate a space of vulnerability for Black women to heal and to continue to develop resilience for liberation and self-determination.

Purpose 2020 has proved to be a challenging year. In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, yet again, the USA has witnessed police brutality leading to the death of a Black man, George Floyd. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, founded in the US but now an international organisation which challenges white supremacy and deliberates harm against Black people, mobilised hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets across the globe. Increasingly, the protests focus not only on George Floyd's murder but also the continued failure to challenge the celebrity of those involved in the transatlantic slave trade and European imperialism. In this article, the author will contend that many organisations are now reexamining their association with these historical wrongs against Black Africa and its diaspora. Further, the author will contend but that the failure to highlight the role of Black chattel slavery and imperialism in the accumulation of economic, commercial and political benefits reaped by the global north is a source of shame not only for many firms and institutions but also for universities. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The author has reviewed the online media for the latest developments in response to Black Lives Matter's George Floyd campaign in 2020 and reviewed the literature on the link between European global ambition and its impact on the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa. Findings Internationally, there is a discernible change in outlook towards the importance of the evils of slavery and colonialism on the Black experience today. These small steps will require scholars to embark on a fresh reexamination of race, society and work.

This will inevitably change especially in those countries that are the main beneficiaries of Black chattel slavery and colonial exploitation.

Purpose In this invited professional insight paper the author draws parallels between recent debates on racism, Black Lives Matter and related research in sport and cognate domains.

It overlays this critique with a recognition of the dynamic and multi-dimensional nature of racisms. Findings While the deaths of Black lives are being mourned it is argued that our attention can also become distracted by narrow manifestations of racism (overt). Such approaches leave key stakeholders efforts focused on the individual to the detriment of challenging systemic policies, practices and dispositions that entrench racism. The color-coded racism of past decades is still with us but in addition to this, our critiques and activism require continued surveillance of cultural, institutional and structural arrangements in the everyday that remain nebulous, complex and difficult to challenge.

The author draws on previous original empirical work and current insights to draw parallels between sport, Black Lives Matter and broader social contexts. Due to limitations in the extant literature in regard to the section on cycling and ethnicity, examples are drawn primarily from the US and UK.

From stop and search, to deaths after police contact, the authors highlight long-standing and widespread racist disparities in UK policing.

We examine how activists used Twitter to balance competing aims for social change, such as growing the movement beyond disadvantaged-group members, while preventing appropriation or dilution of their message by advantaged-group \\u2018allies\\u2019. We find that although Twitter users promote different, and often competing, definitions of the issues that the movement represents, rhetorical strategies are used to advance inclusive definitions that focus on racism. When activists address alternative definitions of movement actors and issues, representations of Otherness are used to characterize the proponents of these definitions as in opposition to the movement. Finally, we find that one way of resolving the tension between growing the movement and promoting disadvantaged-group control is by using identity and technology resources to explicitly define (1) how different groups can be movement advocates, and (2) action strategies for social change.

Nigerian Lives Matter!: Language and Why Black Performance Matters This essay explores performance as a language by looking at its appropriation by other cultures, and the associated history of the crafted phrases that are borrowed along. I start by noting that to create awareness of the massacres that have recently occurred in some parts of Nigeria, commentators, both in and out of the country, and activist-cum-protesters created the term \\u201cNigerian Lives Matter.\\u201e They appropriated from \\u201cBlack Lives Matter,\\u201e the American-originated advocacy movement that campaigns against violence and brutality against black people. I show that these forms of lexical interchange are possible because of non-Americans\\u2019 familiarity with America\\u2019s racial history, and black performance liberation expressivity, which they have been acculturated into as a result of their long exposure to American culture. Beyond phrases however, I argue that black performance itself is a language that has a global resonance among minorities. To illustrate this further, I do a close reading of This is Nigeria , a recent music video released by Nigerian lawyer turned artist, Folarin Falana (Falz), alongside a version of the original production, This is America , also recently released by Donald Glover (Childish Gambino). Both songs continue in the older tradition of African and African American transatlantic political relations through music, the shared understanding of the similarities of anti-black oppression, and the formation of aesthetics that mediate the advocacy of black liberation. The songs are also a pointer to how black advocacy might continue to unfold in contemporary era. performance; language; Black Lives Matter; Nigerian Lives Matter; black liberation; Social Sciences; H Genealogy, Vol 3, Iss 2, p 19 (2019) Abimbola A.

As powerfully placed, Indigenous and non-Indigenous nursing and midwifery professionals, together we can ensure an effective and robust Indigenous curriculum in our nursing and midwifery schools of education. Today, Australia finds itself in a shifting tide of social change, where the voices for better and safer health care ring out loud. Voices for justice, equity and equality reverberate across our cities, our streets, homes, and institutions of learning. It is a call for new songlines of reform. The need to embed meaningful Indigenous health curricula is stronger now than it ever was for Australian nursing and midwifery. It is essential that nursing and midwifery leadership continue to build an authentic collaborative environment for Indigenous curriculum development. Bipartisan alliance is imperative for all academic staff to be confident in their teaching and learning experiences with Indigenous health syllabus. This paper is a call out. Now is the time for Indigenous and non-Indigenous nurses and midwives to make a stand together, for justice and equity in our teaching, learning, and practice. Together we will dismantle systems, policy, and practices in health that oppress. The Black Lives Matter movement provides us with a \\u2018now window\\u2019 of accepted dialogue to build a better, culturally safe Australian nursing and midwifery workforce, ensuring that Black Lives Matter in all aspects of health care.

The interview focuses primarily on civil sphere theory (CST), and Alexander\\u2019s goal in moving towards Durkheimian and away from Parsonian conceptions of solidarity. Alexander addresses common misunderstandings and critiques of CST, describes the current project of the internationalization of CST, and applies the theory to the present crisis of a global pandemic and the social movement of Black Lives Matter. Finally, Alexander reflects upon life in the academic world and the importance of not only analyzing meaning as a cultural sociologist but also working with meaningful projects in order to not be alienated.

This study explores the factors that lead to an avenue for allyship from the Latino community to the Black community. Using attitudes about the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, a series of hypotheses are tested to examine the structure of Latino-Black compared to white-Black coalitions. Two major findings emerge from the analysis; first, differences between whites and Latinos reveal that the effect of harboring anti-Black stereotypes are extraordinarily predictive of rejecting calls for racial social justice and combatting the scourge of police killings of unarmed Black men among whites but not among Latinos. Second, differences according to Latino racial identity and indicators of acculturation also impact support for the BLM movement in ways that both reaffirm but also challenge previous scholarship.

The View from Twitter Abstract This paper examines the ways that social movement organizations affiliated with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement use Twitter through three content analysis studies. The main finding presented in the paper is that the modal tweet generated between December 1, 2015 and October 31, 2016 was an emotional response\\u2014an expression of sadness, outrage, or despair\\u2014to police brutality and the killings of African Americans. The second key finding is that BLM organizations generated more tweets that framed the movement as a struggle for individual rights than ones that utilized frames about gender, racial, and LGBTQ identities. Finally, the paper shows that BLM activists urge their followers to pursue disruptive repertoires of contention less frequently than they encourage other political behaviors. These findings suggest that the BLM movement is intelligible through both the resource mobilization and new social movement paradigms within social movement studies.

Much research has theorized on how digital networks transmit mobilizing content, fewer studies examine the structure of online networks, and even fewer test how the structure of online networks affects participation for political behaviors with differing costs. From a structural network perspective, I highlight the puzzle: If according to recent literature, digital networks are loose with many weak ties, how can such a network configuration facilitate high-cost political behavior that requires multiple social reinforcements? I map the following relationships among 655 Twitter users who follow the Black Lives Matter Sacramento chapter and compare the structure of the digital network to three commonly observed ideal type networks. The results show that the digital network is structurally distinct from the ideal types, as it is characterized by an extremely dense cluster but also with many loosely connected components, which I describe as a \\u201ccluster-connective network.\\u201d Results from computer experiments further show that paradoxically, this \\u201ccluster-connective\\u201d configuration benefits participation for high-cost behavior but hinders participation for low-cost behavior. The results illustrate how a structural network perspective helps scholars move from the question of whether digital networks facilitate participation to the conditions under which digital networks encourage participation.

In short, white backlash is built into the liberal construction of race. Utilizing Joel Olson\\u2019s conception of Herrenvolk democracy, this article analyzes how the color-blind norm of race moves race into a sphere of discourse where it is omnipresent but also disempowered for any legal remedy. Policing becomes an institution by which race is made apparent, as the inequitable treatment by the police dictates who is protected by the color line. Drawn from polling surveys and government reports, data is provided with regard to the unchanging perceptions of racial attitudes. Black Lives Matter takes up the Black radical tradition in order to reassert Black humanity in the face of a system that normalizes racial violence, racial terror, and its own racial ignorance. In this way BLM displays the counternarrative to white hegemony. This counternarrative forces us to realize the depth of the race problem by mobilizing a language of abolition. Circling back to Olson\\u2019s abolition democracy, this article concludes by looking at how far we must go in terms of applying abolition to our discourse, language, conception of humanity, and democracy.

This current intervention into the study of African American Religion examines digital activism through examples of religious media produced by blacks for black audiences.

An Experimental Test The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has organized hundreds of disruptive protests in American cities since 2013 (Garza 2014; Harris 2015; Taylor 2016). The movement has garnered considerable attention from the U.S. media and is well recognized by the U.S. public (Horowitz and Livingston 2016; Neal 2017). Social movement scholars suggest that such robust mobilizations are typically predicated on clear social movement frames (Benford and Snow 2000; Snow et al. 1986). Tillery (2019b) has identified several distinct message frames within the social media communications of BLM activists.

We find that exposure to these frames generates differential effects on respondents\\u2019 willingness to support, trust, canvass, and write representatives about the Black Lives Matter movement. These findings raise new questions about the deployment of intersectional messaging strategies within movements for racial justice.

This experience is shared with an increasing number of young people in the developed North who are also grappling with issues of joblessness and political exclusion. This waithood generation is increasingly losing faith in the ability of its leaders to address young people\\u2019s needs and expectations, and it is rebelling against the status quo. From the youth uprisings that led to the Arab Spring and the ousting of Abdoulaye Wade in Senegal and Campaore in Burkina Faso, to political protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter in the U.S. and Los Indignados in Spain, young people have been at the forefront of political change. However, they have not yet been able to effect systemic change. While profound social transformation takes time, this generation is still wrestling with how to move beyond street protest and have a lasting impact on politics and governance.

White supremacists and White nationalists did not hide their racist ideologies as they demanded that their privileged place in history not be erased. The BLM movement, which challenges state-sanctioned anti-Black racism, was ready to confront themes of White discontent and reverse racism, critiques of political correctness, and the assumption that racialized people should know their place and be content to be the subordinate other.It is easy to frame the events in Charlottesville as indicative of US-specific race problems. However, a sense that White spaces should prevail and an ongoing history of anti-Black racism are not unique to the United States. The rise of Canadian activism under the BLM banner also signals a movement to change Canadian forms of institutional racism in policing, education, and the labor market. This article responds to perceptions that the BLM movement has given insufficient attention to environmental concerns (Pellow 2016; Halpern 2017). Drawing on critical race theory as a conceptual tool, this article focuses on the Canadian context as part of the author\\u2019s argument in favor of greater collaboration between BLM and the environmental justice (EJ) movement in Canada. This article also engages with the common stereotype that Blacks in Canada have it better than Blacks in the United States.

At the same time, the unfolding Black Lives Matter protest movements and the responses by federal agencies each testify to a not insignificant capacity for addressing social pathologies surrounding the color line. In order to respond to this ambivalent situation, this article suggests a pairing between the work of James Baldwin and that of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. I will argue that we cannot fully appreciate the depths of what Baldwin called the \\u201csavage paradox\\u201d of race without the insights provided by Klein and object relations psychoanalysis. Conversely, Baldwin helps us to sound out the political significance of object relations approaches, including the work of Klein and those influenced by her such as Hanna Segal and Wilfred Bion. In conversation with the work of Baldwin, object relations theory can help to identify particular social settings and institutions that might allow concrete efforts toward racial justice to take root.

Indicators of resilience are attributes and resources of an individual and the environment that predict positive adjustment. The purpose of this study was to examine the presence of resilience indicators across three ecological levels (individual, familial, environmental) among disadvantaged youth living in Lebanon and to examine whether indicators were associated with psychological well-being and psychological distress. A sample of 187 adolescents ages 15 to 23 completed surveys, and hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to identify variables associated with psychological outcomes. Higher self-efficacy, curiosity, social support, and the availability\\/involvement with spiritual, cultural, and educational opportunities were related to greater psychological wellbeing. Low self-efficacy was the only indicator that was associated with psychological distress independently above and beyond demographic characteristics. Results support the potential importance of considering resilience indicators across ecological levels for interventions seeking to promote positive psychological outcomes for adolescents in highly stressful contexts. psychology; adolescence; resilience Community Psychology in Global Perspective; Vol 4, No 2 (2018): Community Psychology in Global Perspective - Special issue: Black Lives Matter in Community Psychology; 136-149 ; Community psychology in global perspective.

Respectability Politics and the Limitations of Linked Fate Abstract Cathy Cohen\\u2019s (1999) theory of secondary marginalization helps to explain why the needs of some members of Black communities are not prioritized on \\u201cthe\\u201d Black political agenda; indeed, some groups are ignored altogether as mainstream Black public opinion shifts to the right (Tate 2010). However, the contemporary movement for Black Lives calls for an intersectional approach to Black politics. Its platform requires participants to take seriously the notion that since Black communities are diverse, so are the needs of its members. To what extent are Blacks likely to believe that those who face secondary marginalization should be prioritized on the Black political agenda? What is the role of linked fate in galvanizing support around these marginalized Blacks? To what extent does respectability politics serve to hinder a broader embrace of Blacks who face different sets of interlocking systems of oppression, such as Black women, formerly incarcerated Blacks, undocumented Black people, and Black members of LBGTQ communities in an era marked by Black social movements? We analyze data from the 2016 Collaborative Multi-Racial Post-Election Survey (CMPS) to assess whether all Black lives matter to Black Americans.

With the hope that our field of literacy research is finally taking this racial turn as an institution, I introduce the post-White orientation as well as practice of race theory (PRT) and argue for the lifelong development of racial literacies among fellow literacy researchers.

Many libraries have ignored the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, citing the need to maintain neutrality. Despite extensive scholarship questioning the validity of this concept, the framing of library neutrality as nonpartisanship continues. This paper examines librarianship\\u2019s engagement with, and disengagement from black communities through the lens of the BLM movement. It also explores the implications of education, engagement, and activism for people of color and libraries today. Design\\/methodology\\/approach The authors have engaged the topic from a critical race perspective as a practice in exercising voice \\u2013 telling stories, presenting counterstories, and practicing advocacy (Ladson-Billings, 1998). Findings The assertion that libraries have been socially and politically neutral organizations is ahistorical. When libraries decide not to address issues relevant to people of color, they are not embodying neutrality; they are actively electing not to support the information and service needs of a service population. In order for libraries to live up to their core values, they must engage actively with communities, especially when those communities are in crisis. Originality\\/value As a service field, librarianship has an ethos, values, and history that parallel those of many other service fields. This paper has implications for developing understanding of questions about equitable service provision. black lives matter; library; social justice; community; inclusion; libraries; communities; neutrality; diversity; equity Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal, 36(8) index:\"},{\"id\":\"b6a25065c4e168e61920a3fd37bf42dd4b1d3a73dc49a4ceb5172c6fb743a46b\",\"content\":\"Race, Housing, and the Federal Government: Black Lives on the Margins of the American Dream As historians have increasingly explored the complex historical relationship between race, class, and institutions such as the federal government in shaping contemporary American society, historical sources such as the Federal Housing Association\\u2019s Underwriting Manual (1938) provide provocative opportunities for teaching.

Atheism here, while indeed denying the existence of gods, has as its primary concern affirming life. Too often is theology, as theologian Anthony Pinn says, \\u201ca theology of no-body\\u201d; thus atheistic feminist Blackness, as understood here, seeks to entrench the body rather than abstract it. Atheistic feminist Blackness reinscribes and affirms the subjectivity and humanity of Black, female, and trans bodies, countering hegemonic discourse that explicitly and implicitly states otherwise.
