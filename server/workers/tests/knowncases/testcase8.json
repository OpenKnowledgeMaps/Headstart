Method The corona mortis was dissected out of eight adult cadavers and were simulated for the insertion of the anterior ring minimally invasive plate, and the presence of the anastomotic branch (the corona mortis) in the suprapubic branch area was observed. After the Corona mortis stripped off, the data was measured, such as the length, vessel diameter, distance from the pubic tubercle, and the maximum vertical distance between the corona mortis and the pubis. The measured data and the previous literatures were analyzed to study the morphology of the corona mortis and the position relation between the corona mortis and the placement of subperiosteal tunnel through the minimally invasive ilioinguinal approach. Results Out of the 16 unilateral pelvises, the corona mortis were observed on 12 unilateral pelvises with an incidence rate of 75%. Amongst them, there were seven cases of vein anastomosis (incidence of 43.75%), three cases of arterial anastomosis (incidence of 18.75%), and two cases of both arterial anastomosis and vein anastomosis (incidence of 12.5%). The corona mortis length ranged between 24.5 and 37.5 mm (average of 30.7 \\u00b1 3.6 mm); the diameter ranged between 1.6 and 3.5 mm (average of 2.5 \\u00b1 0.5 mm) and the distance between the vessels and the pubic tubercle was between 53.9 and 65.2 mm (average of 59.0 \\u00b1 3.6 mm). Above the pubis, the corona mortis originated from the iliac or the inferior epigastric vessel. It crossed the pubic branch to the dorsal side of the pubis and proceeded downward to anastomize with the obturator vessels near the obturator. Toothless tweezers were used to peel and lift up the corona mortis from the pubic bone. The maximum vertical distance between the corona mortis and the pubis ranged between 8.8 and 18.3 mm (average of 12.6 \\u00b1 3.0 mm). Conclusion The corona mortis have a high rate of incidence, with a large number of differences in the type and shape of blood vessels among patients. Following peeling, the movement between the corona mortis and pubic bone is limited. Nevertheless, the plate and bone exfoliator still passed safely. Therefore, when surgeons use the minimally invasive ilioinguinal approach to establish channels, the process of subperiosteal stripping must be performed to avoid any accidental injury.\",\"published_in\":\"Orthopaedic Surgery, Vol 12, Iss 3, Pp 957-963 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Corona mortis; Minimally invasive; Pelvic fracture; Plate insertion; Safety; Orthopedic surgery; RD701-811\",\"subject\":\"Corona mortis; Minimally invasive; Pelvic fracture; Plate insertion; Safety; Orthopedic surgery; \",\"authors\":\"Meng\\u2010meng Du; Ai\\u2010guo Wang; Xiao\\u2010hua Shi; Bo Zhao; Ming Liu\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1111\\/os.12679\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"51ab2675de9f714724342e24ee31ad7fe0a7196a7544678e5378279ba0b968fd\",\"relevance\":116},{\"id\":\"53abc9c4b0e318b6324ed11c3d2ecf3e92142a6083b7bd4153b00e3fe4c855f2\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.iain-padangsidimpuan.ac.id\\/index.php\\/almaqasid\\/article\\/view\\/2506\\/pdf_1; 10.24952\\/almaqasid.v6i1.2506.g1913; http:\\/\\/jurnal.iain-padangsidimpuan.ac.id\\/index.php\\/almaqasid\\/article\\/view\\/2506; doi:10.24952\\/almaqasid.v6i1.2506\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/jurnal.iain-padangsidimpuan.ac.id\\/index.php\\/almaqasid\\/article\\/view\\/2506; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.24952\\/almaqasid.v6i1.2506\",\"title\":\"KAJIAN FIKIH JINAYAH SEPUTAR PENANGGULANGAN VIRUS CORONA\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The world is now hit by the popular Corona virus pandemic called Covid 19 which has claimed many lives, nearly millions of human lives have been lost due to the ferocity of the Corona virus.

In this paper, we carry out detailed investigations of magnetic-reconnection heating to the corona, specifically, studying how the disc and corona are self-consistently coupled with the magnetic field, and how the emergent spectra depend on the fundamental parameters of AGN. It is shown that diverse spectral shapes and luminosities over a broad bandpass from optical to X-ray can be produced from the coupled disc and corona within a limited range of the black hole mass, accretion rate, and magnetic field strength. The relative strength of X-ray emission with respect to optical\\/ultraviolet (UV) depends on the strength of the magnetic field in the disc, which, together with accretion rate, determines the fraction of accretion energy transported and released in the corona. This refined disc-corona model is then applied to reproduce the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a sample of 20 bright local AGNs observed simultaneously in X-ray and optical\\/UV. We find that, in general, the overall observed broad-band SEDs can be reasonably reproduced, except for rather hard X-ray spectral shapes in some objects. The radiation pressure-dominant region, as previously predicted for the standard accretion disc in AGN, disappears for strong X-ray sources, revealing that AGN accretion discs are indeed commonly stable as observed. Our study suggests the disc-corona coupling model involving magnetic fields to be a promising approach for understanding the broad-band spectra of bright AGNs.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"accretion; accretion discs; magnetic fields; galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66::\\u5929\\u4f53\\u7269\\u7406\\u5b66; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66::\\u5929\\u4f53\\u7269\\u7406\\u5b66::\\u9ad8\\u80fd\\u5929\\u4f53\\u7269\\u7406\\u5b66; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66::\\u661f\\u7cfb\\u4e0e\\u5b87\\u5b99\\u5b66; \\u7406\\u5b66; \\u7406\\u5b66::\\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66; Astronomy & Astrophysics; X-RAY-SPECTRA; ADVECTION-DOMINATED ACCRETION; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; BLACK-HOLES; EMISSION; ULTRAVIOLET; TEMPERATURE; REFLECTION; TRANSITION; VISCOSITY\",\"subject\":\"accretion; accretion discs; magnetic fields; galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66; \\u7406\\u5b66; Astronomy & Astrophysics; X- ADVECTION-DOMINATED ACCRETION;   EMISSION; ULTRAVIOLET; TEMPERATURE; REFLECTION; TRANSITION; VISCOSITY\",\"authors\":\"Cheng, Huaqing; Liu, B.

Examples include compact structure design and uprating existing transmission lines. Recent research relating electric field uniformity to transmission line capacity and critical flashover voltage underscored the need for better overvoltage data to quantify insulation margins for HSIL design. To that end, this work extends the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method with distributed corona losses to transmission lines with bundled conductors. The model was adapted for practical use in high-volume statistical transient simulation and applied to an example 500 kV line. Transients included line energization and trapped charge reclosing. Overvoltage profiles and statistical distributions were generated from 9500 simulations obtained by random breaker close timing and variation in line length and altitude. Distributed corona losses reduced 98th percentile line-to-ground switching overvoltages by 4%\\u201314% of nominal. The estimated line-to-ground switching surge flashover probability was 54%\\u201380% lower with corona loss. Corona had less impact on line-to-line overvoltages, but the effects were still notable. Results highlight the importance of considering detailed overvoltage profiles and accounting for corona loss attenuation when seeking to carefully quantify insulation design margins.\",\"published_in\":\"Energies, Vol 13, Iss 2474, p 2474 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"power; transmission; corona; overvoltage; switching; insulation; Technology; T\",\"subject\":\"power; transmission; corona; overvoltage; switching; insulation; Technology; T\",\"authors\":\"Jon T.

Their development and application are scientifically and industrially important. The engineering of NPs and the modulation of their in vivo behavior have been extensively studied, and significant achievements have been made in the past decades. However, in vivo applications of NPs are often limited by several difficulties, including inflammatory responses and cellular toxicity, unexpected distribution and clearance from the body, and insufficient delivery to a specific target. These unfavorable phenomena may largely be related to the in vivo protein\\u2013NP interaction, termed \\u201cprotein corona.\\u201d The layer of adsorbed proteins on the surface of NPs affects the biological behavior of NPs and changes their functionality, occasionally resulting in loss-of-function or gain-of-function. The formation of a protein corona is an intricate process involving complex kinetics and dynamics between the two interacting entities.

Their development and application are scientifically and industrially important. The engineering of NPs and the modulation of their in vivo behavior have been extensively studied, and significant achievements have been made in the past decades. However, in vivo applications of NPs are often limited by several difficulties, including inflammatory responses and cellular toxicity, unexpected distribution and clearance from the body, and insufficient delivery to a specific target. These unfavorable phenomena may largely be related to the in vivo protein\\u2013NP interaction, termed \\u201cprotein corona.\\u201d The layer of adsorbed proteins on the surface of NPs affects the biological behavior of NPs and changes their functionality, occasionally resulting in loss-of-function or gain-of-function. The formation of a protein corona is an intricate process involving complex kinetics and dynamics between the two interacting entities. Structural changes in corona proteins have been reported in many cases after their adsorption on the surfaces of NPs that strongly influence the functions of NPs. Thus, understanding of the conformational changes and unfolding process of proteins is very important to accelerate the biomedical applications of NPs. Here, we describe several protein corona characteristics and specifically focus on the conformational fluctuations in corona proteins induced by NPs.Keywords: nanoparticle, protein corona, structure, surface characteristic, conformational change\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Nanomedicine, Vol Volume 15, Pp 5783-5802 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"nanoparticle; protein corona; structure; surface characteristic; conformational change; Medicine (General); R5-920\",\"subject\":\"nanoparticle; protein corona; structure; surface characteristic; conformational change; \",\"authors\":\"Park SJ\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/de508a96d70343e2a8ca504c1b799345\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"a5199c68cef710d47d7ec4de6a37be50afaf54b6163ae1748dc7ef890f399a5f\",\"relevance\":110},{\"id\":\"e3739bdc86e7913f83c3675b88d873ba563528e65b7d70395ae5e6cb2f146f5f\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/readersinsight.net\\/PJMLS\\/article\\/view\\/1402\\/1047; http:\\/\\/readersinsight.net\\/PJMLS\\/article\\/view\\/1402; doi:10.31580\\/pjmls.v3i2.1402\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/readersinsight.net\\/PJMLS\\/article\\/view\\/1402; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.31580\\/pjmls.v3i2.1402\",\"title\":\"Epidemiology and clinical Menifestation of Covid 19\",\"paper_abstract\":\"AbstractThe severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.

When the corona virus outbreak hit Indonesia, the state of the country was not ready to deal with it, so that a quick reaction to prevention socialization had not yet been carried out by Indonesia. Finally, the spread of the corona virus epidemic is very bad for all Indonesian people, because many Indonesians affected by the transmission of this virus, including the health team, are the main group in handling this virus outbreak. Therefore, the government adopted a policy to provide incentives for health teams that fought against the corona virus to benefit the health team and the general public. The study uses a normative legal method with three approaches namely; statute approach, case approach, and philosophical approach. Data was obtained from government policies on presidential policies, policies of the Governor of DKI Jakarta, and other policies. The results of the study stated that the health team is the main group that fights against the corona virus with a very high risk, so the government needs to provide incentives as an effort to benefit and support the health team in fighting the corona covid-19 virus.Keywords: Covid-19, Policy, Incentives. Abstrak Indonesia merupakan salah satu Negara terserang virus corona yang terjadi pada awal 2020. Pada saat wabah virus corona menimpa Indonesia, keadaan negara belum siap untuk menghadapinya, sehingga reaksi cepat sosialisasi pencegahan belum sempat dilakukan oleh Indonesia. Akhirnya penyebaran wabah virus corona ini menjadi hal yang sangat buruk bagi seluruh masyarakat Indonesia, karena banyak warga Indonesia yang terkena dampak penularan virus ini termasuk para tim kesehatan yang menjadi kelompok utama dalam menangani wabah virus ini. Oleh karenanya, pemerintah mengambil kebijakan untuk memberikan insentif bagi tim kesehatan yang berperang melawan virus corona guna memberikan kemaslahatan bagi tim kesehatan dan masyarakat umum. Penelitian menggunakan metode hukum normatif dengan tiga pendekatan yaitu; statute approach, case approach, dan philosophical approach. Data diperoleh dari kebijakan pemerintah kebijakan presiden, kebijakan gubernur DKI Jakarta, serta kebijakan lainnya.

Electrostatic precipitators are very useful as a means to reduce emissions from heavy industry factories. This paper aims to examine the performance of wire-duct electrostatic precipitators (WDESP) as affected by high-temperature incoming gases with a varying number of discharge wires while increasing their radius. The precipitator performance is expressed in terms of the corona onset voltage on the stressed wires and the corona current\\u2013voltage (I\\u2013V) characteristic of the precipitators working with incoming gases at high temperatures. The start of the corona onset voltage on the surface of the discharge wires is calculated for the precipitators under high temperatures based on the standard of the self-repeat of avalanches\\u2019 electrons developing on the surface of the stressed wires at high temperatures. For this, calculating the electrostatic field in the precipitators with single- and multi-discharge wires due to the stressed wire with the use of the well-known charge simulation method (CSM) with high-temperature incoming gases is important. The modeling of corona I\\u2013V characteristics is adopted using the finite element method (FEM) for single- and multi- (3-, 5-, and 7-) discharge wires of WDESP with high-temperature incoming gases. Additionally, the electrostatic field, potential, and space charge of WDESP are calculated by a simultaneous solution of equations of Poisson, current density, and the continuity current density. A WDESP was set up in the Laboratory of High Voltage Engineering of Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague, the Czech Republic, to measure the corona onset voltage values and corona I\\u2013V characteristics for different WDESP configurations at high temperatures with a varying number of discharge wires while increasing their radius. The calculated values of the corona onset voltage based on CSM and the calculated corona I\\u2013V characteristics based on FEM agree reasonably with those measured experimentally with high-temperature WDESP.\",\"published_in\":\"Mathematics, Vol 8, Iss 1406, p 1406 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"modeling of corona discharge; finite element method; electrostatic precipitators; corona-onset voltage; corona I\\u2013V characteristic; high-temperature incoming gases; Mathematics; QA1-939\",\"subject\":\"modeling of corona discharge; finite element method; electrostatic precipitators; corona-onset voltage; corona I\\u2013V characteristic; high-temperature incoming gases; Mathematics; \",\"authors\":\"Hamdy A.

As a multifaceted phenomenon, corona-virus prevalence is much more significant than other simple medical conditions. It involves several dimensions including dynamism, complicated, extensiveness, variety, and depth. It can accelerate or slow down grand global trends including the impressive trend of smart virtualization by the multinational nongovernmental specialist companies for realization of the global village. Hence, at present, numerous scientific researches regarding various aspects of crisis management, including health and biology, economics, technology, culture and sociology, ethics, spirituality, politics, security, inter nationality and law, as well as the future of corona-virus and the post-corona world are being held on the phenomenon of corona-virus prevalence by universities and scientific centers in the world. These scientific researches and experiments by individuals and institutions, all together, are creating new knowledge in various scientific fields. Therefore, it seems necessary to concentrate on knowledge management in the crisis of corona-virus prevalence. Knowledge offers a firm foundation for intelligent, correct, and timely behavior at individual, group, organizational, national, and global levels. Conscious and systematized reflection on the lessons learned from the corona-virus outbreak, as well as the proper methods discovered, makes it possible for people to take the best advantage from the knowledge they have gained with difficulty. Furthermore, it seems necessary to design and apply the architecture of knowledge gained by the corona-virus prevalence to enable step-by-step processing and knowledge transformation in different fields through an interdisciplinary approach (just as knowledge products are processed), and to ensure that the acquired knowledge is provided to the end-users and are used appropriately. Based on a review and meta-analysis of theoretical literature relating to the main approaches to knowledge management cycles, knowledge management cycle in the corona-virus outbreak crisis can be presented in the following three main stages: 1) Acquisition or creation of the knowledge derived from corona; 2) Targeted distribution or general sharing of knowledge derived from corona; 3) Understanding and applying the knowledge derived from corona.\",\"published_in\":\"\\u0645\\u062f\\u06cc\\u0631\\u06cc\\u062a \\u0631\\u0627\\u0647\\u0628\\u0631\\u062f\\u06cc \\u062f\\u0627\\u0646\\u0634 \\u0633\\u0627\\u0632\\u0645\\u0627\\u0646\\u06cc , Vol 3, Iss 8, Pp 1-4 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"knowledge management; knowledge management cycle; coronavirus; Management.

Tulisan ini menyajikan dua masalah pokok. Pertama, apakah pandemi corona dapat dijadikan sebagai alasan pemutusan hubungan kerja pekerja oleh perusahaan? kedua, bagaimana perlindungan hak pekerja yang diputus hubungan kerjannya oleh perusahaan menurut UU Ketenagakerjaan? Melalui kajian secara yuridis normatif, diperoleh penjelasan bahwa pengusaha dapat menggunakan pandemi corona sebagai alasan force majeure untuk melakukan PHK karena: berpengaruh terhadap keuangan dan kewajiban perusahaan kepada pekerja; merupakan peristiwa yang sifatnya tidak terduga; serta corona sebagai bencana nonalam berskala nasional. Selain alasan force majeure, efisiensi juga menjadi alasan untuk melakukan PHK. PHK karena alasan force majeure melahirkan hak bagi pekerja sesuai ketentuan Pasal 164 ayat (1), sedangkan bila PHK karena alasan efisiensi, maka hak pekerja sesuai ketentua Pasal 164 ayat (3) UU Ketenagakerjaan.Kata kunci: pandemi corona, pemutusan hubungan kerja, force majeure, efisiensi\",\"published_in\":\"Yurispruden: Jurnal Fakultas Hukum Universitas Islam Malang; Vol 3, No 2 (2020): Yurispruden: Jurnal Fakultas Hukum Universitas Islam Malang; 119-136 ; 2614-3992 ; 2614-3852\",\"year\":\"2020-06-23\",\"subject_orig\":\"Hukum Perdata\",\"subject\":\"Hukum Perdata\",\"authors\":\"Randi, Yusuf\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/riset.unisma.ac.id\\/index.php\\/yur\\/article\\/view\\/6709\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"9a48a48d51333f686a2d2a8d87d80a4a62d105114a2f113f9c4b5ada75d66aba\",\"relevance\":101},{\"id\":\"ba73ed30a322d0e4296417d03dba9365eedcb70b57109c671f2172b25b8c5fe5\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/1996-1073\\/13\\/11\\/2785; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1996-1073; doi:10.3390\\/en13112785; 1996-1073; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6786c048447f4657989d49597f909236\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/en13112785; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/6786c048447f4657989d49597f909236\",\"title\":\"Experimental Study of the Corona Performance of Aged Sand-Cast Substation Connectors\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Substation connectors, like many other high-voltage products, are tested once manufactured. However, the corona behavior of aged specimens can differ from that exhibited by newer ones, thus generating detrimental technical and environmental effects. Manufacturers need to know the long-term corona behavior of substation connectors to offer their customers maximum safety and transparency about such critical products. This paper analyzes the ageing effect on the surface roughness and the visual corona extinction voltage of sand-cast aluminum connectors, which were artificially aged in a salt spray chamber for different periods. The experimental results show an important variability of the surface roughness and corona extinction voltage (CEV) among connectors with the same ageing level due to the sand-casting manufacturing process. The results in this paper also show a slight increase in the surface roughness with the ageing period, although there is not a clear pattern between the applied ageing level and the experimental CEV value. It is concluded that the inherent variability among connectors due to the sand-cast process has more influence than the ageing effect itself.\",\"published_in\":\"Energies, Vol 13, Iss 2785, p 2785 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"corona effect; ageing; substation connectors; high-voltage; sand casting; Technology; T\",\"subject\":\"corona effect; ageing; substation connectors; high-voltage; sand casting; Technology; T\",\"authors\":\"Jordi-Roger Riba; Santiago Bogarra; \\u00c1lvaro G\\u00f3mez-Pau; Manuel Moreno-Eguilaz\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3390\\/en13112785\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ba73ed30a322d0e4296417d03dba9365eedcb70b57109c671f2172b25b8c5fe5\",\"relevance\":100},{\"id\":\"8211e3dda0440cd42548aadcf66cf49d093c9bf28ef8b3b8506b2edf4fef6036\",\"relation\":\"doi:10.5281\\/zenodo.3938892; https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3938893; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3938893; oai:zenodo.org:3938893\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/zenodo.org\\/record\\/3938893; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.5281\\/zenodo.3938893\",\"title\":\"CATASTROPHE BY AN INVISIBLE GUEST- 2019 & ONGOING DRUG TRAILS ALONG WITH THE STATUS OF VACCINE PREPARATION\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Within the first fifty days of the epidemic outbreak of novel corona virus in Wuhan, had killed more than eighteen hundred and infected over seventy thousand individuals.

Hampir kurang lebih 200 Negara di Dunia terjangkit virus corona termasuk Indonesia. Berbagai upaya dalam rangka pencegahan, pengobatan, dan sebagainya pun telah dilakukan dalam mencegah penyebaran virus corona, hingga lockdown dan social distancing di kota-kota besar sudah dilakukan untuk memutus rantai penyebaran virus korona. Dalam Islam wabah virus korona ini merupakan sebuah ujian bagi suatu kaum agar selalu mendekatkan diri kepada Allah. Islam juga mengajarkan istilah lockdown dan social distancing dalam rangka pencegahan penularan penyakit, sebagian para ulama menyebutkan Istilah penyakit ini disebut dengan Tho\\u2019un yaitu wabah yang mengakibatkan penduduk sakit dan berisiko menular.Kata Kunci : Covid-19, Pandangan Islam\",\"published_in\":\"SALAM: Jurnal Sosial dan Budaya Syar-i; Vol 7, No 6 (2020): Special Issue Coronavirus Covid-19; 555-564 ; 2654-9050 ; 2356-1459\",\"year\":\"2020-04-14\",\"subject_orig\":\"\",\"subject\":\"\",\"authors\":\"Supriatna, Eman\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/journal.uinjkt.ac.id\\/index.php\\/salam\\/article\\/view\\/15247\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"e0ad3c6bffb23ca51e5891ce66f50107c8e1081a28f313108d7fdf095fee2e91\",\"relevance\":91},{\"id\":\"ba2607d0d8e51c9a8a1651434127912da0ed697fd54675b8381c491c422235df\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.dovepress.com\\/available-evidence-and-ongoing-hypothesis-on-corona-virus-covid-19-and-peer-reviewed-article-PRBM; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1179-1578; 1179-1578; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c83fbfcd330541f3ae272918ef460267\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c83fbfcd330541f3ae272918ef460267\",\"title\":\"Available Evidence and Ongoing Hypothesis on Corona Virus (COVID-19) and Psychosis: Is Corona Virus and Psychosis Related?

Prevention strategies to control the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as closing of schools, refraining from gathering, and social distancing, have direct impacts on mental well-being. SARS-CoV-2 has a devastating psychological impact on the mental health status of the community and, particularly when associated with psychotic symptoms, it could affect the overall quality-of-life. The virus also has the potential to enter and infect the brain. As a result, psychosis symptoms could be an emerging phenomenon associated with the corona virus pandemic. The presence of psychotic symptoms may complicate the management options of patients with COVID-19.Objective: The aim of this article review is to elaborate the relationships between COVID-19 and psychotic symptoms.Methodology: We independently searched different electronic databases, such as Google scholar, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and other relevant sources published in English globally, by using the search terms \\u201cpsychosis and COVID-19\\u201d, \\u201ccorona virus\\u201d, \\u201cbrief psychotic\\u201d, \\u201cschizophrenia\\u201d, \\u201corganic psychosis\\u201d, \\u201cinfectious disease\\u201d, \\u201cmental illness\\u201d, \\u201cpandemics\\u201d, and \\u201cpsychiatry\\u201d in various permutations and combinations.Results: The results of the included studies revealed that patients with a novel corona virus had psychotic symptoms, including hallucination in different forms of modality, delusion, disorganized speech, and grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviors. The patients with COVID-19-related psychotic symptoms had responded with a short-term administration of the antipsychotic medication.Conclusion and Recommendation: A corona virus-related psychosis has been identified in different nations, but it is difficult to conclude that a novel corona virus has been biologically related to psychosis or exacerbates psychotic symptoms. Therefore, to identify the causal relationships between COVID-19 and psychosis, the researchers should investigate the prospective study on the direct biological impacts of COVID-19 and psychosis, and the clinicians should pay attention for psychotic symptoms at the treatment center and isolation rooms in order to reduce the complication of a novel corona virus.Keywords: COVID-19, psychosis, SARS-CoV-2, 2020\",\"published_in\":\"Psychology Research and Behavior Management, Vol Volume 13, Pp 701-704 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"covid-19; psychosis; sars-cov-2; 2020; Psychology; BF1-990; Industrial psychology; HF5548.7-5548.85\",\"subject\":\"covid- psychosis; sars-cov-2; Psychology;  Industrial psychology;; 7-\",\"authors\":\"Tariku M; Hajure M\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/c83fbfcd330541f3ae272918ef460267\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ba2607d0d8e51c9a8a1651434127912da0ed697fd54675b8381c491c422235df\",\"relevance\":90},{\"id\":\"2243a272084636f7e8acf5d76af769b2fef1644a6f8d6f7363cebf52470b721d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.openagrar.de\\/receive\\/openagrar_mods_00062760; https:\\/\\/www.openagrar.de\\/servlets\\/MCRFileNodeServlet\\/openagrar_derivate_00032080\\/NDR-1-RadioMV-20200804.pdf; https:\\/\\/www.ndr.de\\/nachrichten\\/mecklenburg-vorpommern\\/Riems-Forscher-testen-Corona-Impfstoff-an-Frettchen,coronavirus2796.html\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/www.openagrar.de\\/receive\\/openagrar_mods_00062760; https:\\/\\/www.openagrar.de\\/servlets\\/MCRFileNodeServlet\\/openagrar_derivate_00032080\\/NDR-1-RadioMV-20200804.pdf; https:\\/\\/www.ndr.de\\/nachrichten\\/mecklenburg-vorpommern\\/Riems-Forscher-testen-Corona-Impfstoff-an-Frettchen,coronavirus2796.html\",\"title\":\"Riems: Forscher testen Corona-Impfstoff - an Frettchen\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Forscher des Friedrich-Loeffler-Instituts (FLI) auf der Insel Riems bei Greifswald testen derzeit einen m\\u00f6glichen Impfstoff gegen das Coronavirus.

Generally, infection caused by Corona viruses progresses asymptomatically in healthy children and rarely causes morbidity and mortality. Despite this fact, the infection may cause a severe clinical picture in the elderly and adults and children with predisposing underlying disease. The novel Corona virus outbreak, which started in China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over the world and turned into a pandemic. This pandemic, named as COVID-19 by WHO (World Health Organisation), caused economic and social losses all over the world and caused more than 450,000 deaths worldwide up to 21 June. COVID-19, whose specific antiviral therapy and preventive vaccine is not yet available, is still the most serious health problem in the world.Keywords: Coronaviruses, Pandemic, Pediatrics, Children\",\"published_in\":\"Volume: 3, Issue: \\u00d6zel Say\\u0131 140-148 ; 2651-4184 ; Medical Research Reports\",\"year\":\"2020-08-05T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"COVID-19,Pandemi,Pediyatri,\\u00c7ocuk\",\"subject\":\"COVID-Pandemi,Pediyatri,\\u00c7ocuk\",\"authors\":\"\\u00c7\\u0130FT\\u00c7\\u0130, Mustafa\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/mrr\\/issue\\/56260\\/756578\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"6cbd9683bb970d9df6a3acb7696a4a09753a689cf07fe1c58362c188077d5f47\",\"relevance\":86},{\"id\":\"fdddbaaada7e8439d8e8dbdae7f81b2cd9c74bcc2a795cf1c14d3f2fe37e7e0f\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.mdpi.com\\/1996-1073\\/13\\/11\\/2785\\/htm; info:eu-repo\\/grantAgreement\\/MICINN\\/2PE\\/RTC-2017-6297-3; info: eu-repo\\/grantAgreement\\/AGAUR\\/2PE\\/ 2017 SGR 967; Riba, J.

However, the corona behavior of aged specimens can differ from that exhibited by newer ones, thus generating detrimental technical and environmental effects. Manufacturers need to know the long-term corona behavior of substation connectors to offer their customers maximum safety and transparency about such critical products. This paper analyzes the ageing effect on the surface roughness and the visual corona extinction voltage of sand-cast aluminum connectors, which were artificially aged in a salt spray chamber for different periods. The experimental results show an important variability of the surface roughness and corona extinction voltage (CEV) among connectors with the same ageing level due to the sand-casting manufacturing process. The results in this paper also show a slight increase in the surface roughness with the ageing period, although there is not a clear pattern between the applied ageing level and the experimental CEV value. It is concluded that the inherent variability among connectors due to the sand-cast process has more influence than the ageing effect itself. ; This research was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\\u00f3n de Espa\\u00f1a, grant number RTC-2017-6297-3 and by the Generalitat de Catalunya, grant number 2017 SGR 967. ; Peer Reviewed ; Postprint (published version)\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"\\u00c0rees tem\\u00e0tiques de la UPC::Enginyeria el\\u00e8ctrica::Alta tensi\\u00f3; High voltages; Electric conductors; Sand; Corona effect; Ageing; Substation connectors; High-voltage; Sand casting; Alta tensi\\u00f3; Conductors el\\u00e8ctrics; Sorra\",\"subject\":\" High voltages; Electric conductors; Sand; Corona effect; Ageing; Substation connectors; High-voltage; Sand casting; Alta tensi\\u00f3; Conductors el\\u00e8ctrics; Sorra\",\"authors\":\"Riba Ruiz, Jordi-Roger; Bogarra Rodr\\u00edguez, Santiago; G\\u00f3mez Pau, \\u00c1lvaro; Moreno Eguilaz, Juan Manuel\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/hdl.handle.net\\/2117\\/189794\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"fdddbaaada7e8439d8e8dbdae7f81b2cd9c74bcc2a795cf1c14d3f2fe37e7e0f\",\"relevance\":85},{\"id\":\"76ccb51aa0c7e8e73d19c4e9ec3303e7580c3a3d614ffdbcd6538a9e2a7353bc\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/www.folkloredebiyat.org\\/Makaleler\\/1683353739_corona%20yeni5.pdf; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1300-7491; doi:10.22559\\/folklor.1325; 1300-7491; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/070e2e05eba94efda25a0f35638ddb4b\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.22559\\/folklor.1325; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/070e2e05eba94efda25a0f35638ddb4b\",\"title\":\"Corona And Paul Celan Or Love And Pandemic\\/ Corona ve Paul Celan Ya da A\\u015fk ve Pandemi\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The year 2020 has already taken place in history pages as a year of pandemic in which the coronavirus outbreak has taken millions of lives all over the world. This year also coincides with the 50th anniversary of the death of Paul Celan (1920-1970), one of the well-known poets of the post-war Austrian lyric. Interestingly, Celan named his poem Corona, which he wrote seventy-two years ago. The year 1948 corresponds to three years after the end of the Second World War in world history. In Celan\\u2019s personal history these years coincide with tough times, when he emigrated to Czernowitz, Bucharest and then Vienna after surviving the Nazi death camp where his parents were sacrificed. The friendships that Celan built here with the writers around the literature in Vienna, especially meeting the Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann (1926-1973), constitute a turning point in his life. Two great poets experience passionate love. This poem of Celan carries traces of this stormy love in 1948. The main purpose of this study is to analyze this poem and also to investigate whether there is a relationship between Corona and Celan\\u2019s poem with the same title, which is known as the name of the pandemic virus that has killed millions of people today. In this way, it is aimed to draw attention to both the poetry of the master poet, who entered the 50th year of his death in 2020, and the epidemic of the Corona virus that threatened all humanity.

This is the first study to investigate mental health, i. e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. RESULTS: Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. DISCUSSION: Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too. Specific psychotherapeutic interventions, targeting at cognitive restructuring and sensitizing regarding dealing with alcohol and cigarettes, may be needed in order to protect this vulnerable group of person during and after the Corona pandemic.\",\"published_in\":\"Krammer, Sandy; Augstburger, Roland; Haeck, Martina; Maercker, Andreas (2020).

For this reason, protein corona evolution and biodistribution of different chitosan (Ch)-based nanoparticles including Ch and carboxymethyl dextran (CMD)\\/thiolated dextran (TD) polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) were studied using highly precious and sensitive methods such as liquid chromatography-mass\\/mass (LC-MS\\/MS) spectroscopy and positron emission tomography\\/computed tomography (PET\\/CT) scan.

Designed PECs have low amounts of proteins in corona mostly enriched by Apolipoproteins, protein C, hemoglobin subunits, and inter-alpha- trypsin inhibitor that beside improving uptake of nanoparticles, they have low liver uptake and notable heart blood pool accumulation that confirmed the long circulation time of the nanoparticles which is favorable for delivery of nanoparticles to the site of action and achieving required therapeutic effect.\",\"published_in\":\"Scientific Reports, Vol 10, Iss 1, Pp 1-14 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"subject\":\"Medicine; R; Science; Q\",\"authors\":\"Farnaz Sadat Mirzazadeh Tekie; Maliheh Hajiramezanali; Parham Geramifar; Mohammad Raoufi; Rassoul Dinarvand; Masoud Soleimani; Fatemeh Atyabi\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/s41598-020-66572-y\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"ecb5e8d19c4a52e819017d1c5622b9f0d726cf35b6f915d5c45c2ff180829c05\",\"relevance\":79},{\"id\":\"902c8c72b02e9fa417ce29a1fe09a14d3ca4471c36e1f612cbd6b3f57f7cc10d\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/prokla.de\\/index.php\\/PROKLA\\/article\\/view\\/1885\\/1806; https:\\/\\/prokla.de\\/index.php\\/PROKLA\\/article\\/view\\/1885\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/prokla.de\\/index.php\\/PROKLA\\/article\\/view\\/1885\",\"title\":\"In Verteidigung des Lebens: \\u00dcber die Corona-Pandemie, die sozial\\u00f6kologische Gro\\u00dfkrise und die M\\u00f6glichkeit eines neuen Sozialismusbegriffs ; In defense of life: About the Corona Pandemic, the socio-ecological large-scale crisis and the possibility of a new concept of socialism\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Die Corona-Pandemie hat die schon l\\u00e4nger heraufziehende sozial\\u00f6kologische Gro\\u00dfkrise vorweggenommen und verweist auf eine letztlich antagonistische Beziehung von Kapital und Leben.

The Corona viruses (CoV) belong to the genus Corona virus in the Corona viridae. All CoVs are pleomorphic RNA viruses characteristically containing crown-shape peplomers with 80-160 nM in size and 27-32 kb positive polarity. Recombination rates of CoVs are very high because of constantly developing transcription errors and RNA dependent on the RNA polymerase (RdRP) jump.

In this pandemic situation where the novel corona virus continuously spreading day by day worldwide, the researcher are focused on finding new ways to destroy the coronavirus. Because airborne transmission appears to plays an important role in the spread of coronavirus, UV light would be able to destroy the novel corona virus when exposure to UVC irradiation stronger than 90 \\u00b5W\\/cm2. Devices using UV light, emits high-intensity rays could help to kill the novel coronavirus. In order to kill the novel corona virus, very high levels of ultraviolet light is required ranges from 200 to 300 nanometer.

This cloud of protein aggregates hampers the targeting and transport capabilities of the NPs, thereby compromising their biomedical applications. Therefore, there is a high interest in the development of technologies that allow control over PC formation, as this would provide a handle to manipulate NPs in biological fluids. We present a strategy that enables the reversible disruption of the PC using external stimuli, thereby allowing a precise regulation of NP cellular uptake. The approach, demonstrated for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), is based on a biorthogonal, supramolecular host-guest interactions between an anionic dye bound to the AuNP surface and a positively charged macromolecular cage. This supramolecular complex effectively behaves as a zwitterionic NP ligand, which is able not only to prevent PC formation but also to disrupt a previously formed hard corona. With this supramolecular stimulus, the cellular internalization of AuNPs can be enhanced by up to 30-fold in some cases, and even NP cellular uptake in phagocytic cells can be regulated. Additionally, we demonstrate that the conditional cell uptake of purposely designed gold nanorods can be used to selectively enhance photothermal cell death.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-05-26\",\"subject_orig\":\"Chemistry\",\"subject\":\"Chemistry\",\"authors\":\"Mosquera, Jes\\u00fas; Garc\\u00eda, Isabel; Henriksen-Lacey, Malou; Mart\\u00ednez-Calvo, Miguel; Dhanjani, M\\u00f3nica; Mascaren\\u00e3s, Jos\\u00e9 L.; Liz-Marz\\u00e1n, Luis M.\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/strathprints.strath.ac.uk\\/73786\\/\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"7ebe7193bb96f6e331ffd2177ade96590fc13de396bd8c3937f3d10e2bb73a46\",\"relevance\":67},{\"id\":\"1c9c46e2c41c79ae848ee3a06d1ff74ac3fe0e519ba117b280ef97e3ad5c327c\",\"relation\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/download\\/article-file\\/1220883; https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/auhfd\\/issue\\/56254\\/775253; doi:10.33629\\/auhfd.775253\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/dergipark.org.tr\\/tr\\/pub\\/auhfd\\/issue\\/56254\\/775253; https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.33629\\/auhfd.775253\",\"title\":\"In the Shade of Corona (Covid-19) Law of the Future and Competition Law in the Era of Digital Economy ; Corona (Covid 19) G\\u00f6lgesinde Gelece\\u011fin Hukuku ve Dijital Ekonomi \\u00c7a\\u011f\\u0131nda Rekabet Hukuku\",\"paper_abstract\":\"In this study, the interplay between law and digital economy in the digital era which indispensibly affects all aspects of our lives has been discussed.

Virus Corona adalah virus yang menyerang sistem pernafasan yang bisa menyebabkan gangguan pernafasan, pneumonia akut, sampai kematian. Infeksi virus ini disebut COVID-19 dan pertama kali ditemukan di kota Wuhan, Tiongkok, pada akhir Desember 2019. Virus ini menular dengan cepat dan telah menyebar ke wilayah lain di Tiongkok dan ke beberapa negara termasuk Indonesia. Pada tanggal 2 Maret 2020, Presiden Republik Indonesia, Joko Widodo resmi mengumumkan bahwa ada dua WNI yang positif COVID-19. Informasi ini pun resmi diberitakan oleh berbagai media massa khususnya televisi dengan angle yang beragam. Sebagai saluran berbasis audio-visual, televisi masih diangggap alat yang ampuh untuk membentuk opini publik. Dengan menggunakan pendekatan Analisis Framing Zhongdang Pan dan Gerald M.Kosicki, identifikasi tentang penggunaan televisi untuk kepentingan publik diklasifikasikan dengan melakukan analisis empat struktur framing besar yaitu sintaksis, skrip, tematik, dan retoris. Dari analisis tersebut ditemukan perbedaan framing dalam konten pemberitaan yang disiarkan oleh 2 televisi swasta yang ada di Indonesia, TV One dan Kompas TV. TV One membingkai pemberitaan virus Corona dengan mengedepankan kepanikan dan ketakutan, sedangkan Kompas TV lebih fokus kepada upaya penanganan dan solusi pencegahan.\",\"published_in\":\"ORASI: Jurnal Dakwah dan Komunikasi; Vol 11, No 1 (2020): July 2020; 87-104 ; 2541-7142 ; 2085-7357 ; 10.24235\\/orasi.v11i1\",\"year\":\"2020-07-27\",\"subject_orig\":\"Ilmu Komunikasi; Analisis Framing; Kompas TV; Media Televisi; TV One; Virus Corona\",\"subject\":\"Ilmu Komunikasi; Analisis Framing; Kompas TV; Media Televisi; TV One; Virus Corona\",\"authors\":\"Syaefudin, Mochamad; Humardhiana, Ana\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.syekhnurjati.ac.id\\/jurnal\\/index.php\\/orasi\\/article\\/view\\/6291\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"68498cbe2409a5f2e50a7bf2f5446a81e74954ff1af9df9209ba34175b1d988c\",\"relevance\":64},{\"id\":\"cad29863c7fe3a121824ffb7eb0a660a87140e584eac41aaada5a923e55717ae\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/syariah\\/Supremasi\\/article\\/view\\/2125\\/pdf; http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/syariah\\/Supremasi\\/article\\/view\\/2125\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/ejournal.uin-suka.ac.id\\/syariah\\/Supremasi\\/article\\/view\\/2125\",\"title\":\"Implikasi Yuridis Penetapan Status Bencana Nasional Pandemi Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Terhadap Perbuatan Hukum Keperdataan\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Implication Juridical the Determination of Status National Disaster Pandemics Corona Virus Disease 2019 (covid-19) of Civil Legal ActionBy : Wardatul Fitri, MH. AbstractThis journal aims to find out if a legal basis which is the legitimacy of epidemics corona viruses disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) expressed as a national disaster, and how are the implications juridical against the determination of the status of the national disaster corona pandemic virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in civil legal action. This journal principally used the normative, by analyzing the regulations, in Indonesia , journal electronic data, then mixed with ingredients parse the law and the results presented in the form of narrative as a process to formulate a conclusion. The analysis was conducted by decomposing, discuss, interpret the law with perspective or a particular viewpoint. The discussion from the journal shows that the legal basis for the legitimacy of epidemic diseases corona viruses disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) declared a national disaster is a decision of the president number 12 years 2020 non nature disaster on the determination of the corona viruses disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) as, national disaster the implication in selecting the juridical status national disaster corona pandemic virus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) in civil legal action is with respect to the implementation of the agreement \\/contract. The issuance of a presidential decree number 12 years 2020 disaster on the determination non nature the spread of a national disaster, covid 19 the next one on a level the implementation of followed up with government policy in the application of large scale social restrictions (PSBB) and social distancing, which in turn causing obstruction of a debtor obligations to fulfill his achievements to the creditors could be used as a reason to defend themselves to charges of wanprestasi by reason of force majeure ( force majeure or overmacht).

Implikasi Yuridis Penetapan Status Bencana NasionalPandemi Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)Terhadap Perbuatan Hukum KeperdataanOleh : Wardatul Fitri, S.H., M.H.[1] ABSTRAKJurnal ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui apakah dasar hukum yang menjadi legitimasi wabah penyakit Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) dinyatakan sebagai Bencana Nasional, serta bagaimanakah implikasi yuridis terhadap Penetapan Status Bencana Nasional Pandemi Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) di dalam Perbuatan Hukum Keperdataan; Jurnal ini pada prinsipnya menggunakan pendekatan normatif, yaitu dengan menganalisa peraturan perundang-undangan yang berlaku di Indonesia, jurnal, data elektronik, kemudian diolah dengan mengurai bahan-bahan hukum tersebut dan hasilnya disajikan dalam bentuk narasi sebagai proses untuk merumuskan suatu kesimpulan. Analisis dilakukan dengan menguraikan, membahas, menafsirkan bahan-bahan hukum dengan perspektif atau sudut pandang tertentu. Hasil pembahasan dari jurnal ini menunjukkan bahwa dasar hukum yang menjadi legitimasi wabah penyakit Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) dinyatakan sebagai Bencana Nasional adalah Keputusan Presiden Nomor 12 Tahun 2020 tanggal 13 April 2020 tentang Penetapan Bencana Nonalam Penyebaran Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) sebagai Bencana Nasional, selanjutnya implikasi yuridis terhadap Penetapan Status Bencana Nasional Pandemi Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) di dalam Perbuatan Hukum Keperdataan adalah sehubungan dengan pelaksanaan perjanjian\\/kontrak. Diterbitkannya Keputusan Presiden Nomor 12 Tahun 2020 tentang Penetapan Bencana Non Alam Penyebaran COVID 19 sebagai Bencana Nasional, yang selanjutnya pada tataran implementasi ditindaklanjuti dengan kebijakan pemerintah dalam penerapan Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar (PSBB) dan social distancing, yang pada akhirnya menyebabkan terhalangnya kewajiban debitur untuk memenuhi prestasinya kepada kreditur dapat dijadikan alasan untuk membela dirinya atas tuntutan wanprestasi dengan alasan keadaan memaksa (force majeure atau overmacht). Kata Kunci : Covid-19, alasan Covid-19 sebagai force majeure, force majeure, wanprestasi.

A numerical model, based on the shell technique applied on reduced magnetohydrodynamics equations, is used to represent energy injection due to footpoint motions, storage and dissipation of energy in a coronal loop. Motions at the loop bases are simulated by random signals whose frequency-wavenumber spectrum reproduces features of photospheric motions: the p -mode peak and the low-frequency continuum. Results indicate that a turbulent state develops, dominated by magnetic energy, where dissipation takes place in an intermittent fashion. The nonlinear cascade is mainly controlled by velocity fluctuations, where resonant modes are dominant at high frequencies. Low frequency fluctuations present a power-law spectra and a bump at p -mode frequency; similar features are observed in velocity spectra detected in the corona. For typical loop parameters the energy input flux is comparable with that necessary to heat the quiet-Sun corona.\",\"published_in\":\"Atmosphere, Vol 11, Iss 409, p 409 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"solar corona; turbulence; numerical modeling; Meteorology.

Therefore, processing these images is important for determining various types of information. However, it is very difficult to elucidate the intricate structure of the corona because of the steep radial gradient in terms of brightness and the large differences in brightness within local areas of coronal images. In this study, we present a filter inspired by the normalizing-radial-graded filter, which we call the radial local multi-scale filter (RLMF). The RLMF method extracts radial vectors and performs local multi-scale filtering based on each vector, before normalizing the vector in order to enhance coronal images. This method facilitates the enhancement of large-scale structural characteristics and fine details in low contrast regions. To demonstrate the power of the RLMF, we applied the proposed method to Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph C2 and K-Coronagraph observations. The RLMF method more clearly revealed the fine details of the corona and CMEs compared with the original observations.\",\"published_in\":\"\",\"year\":\"2020-08-01\",\"subject_orig\":\"Coronal enhancement; Image processing; Radial local multi-scale filter; Solar corona; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66::\\u592a\\u9633\\u4e0e\\u592a\\u9633\\u7cfb; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66::\\u592a\\u9633\\u4e0e\\u592a\\u9633\\u7cfb::\\u592a\\u9633\\u4e0e\\u592a\\u9633\\u7cfb\\u5176\\u4ed6\\u5b66\\u79d1; \\u8ba1\\u7b97\\u673a\\u79d1\\u5b66\\u6280\\u672f; \\u7406\\u5b66; \\u7406\\u5b66::\\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66; \\u5de5\\u5b66; \\u5de5\\u5b66::\\u8ba1\\u7b97\\u673a\\u79d1\\u5b66\\u4e0e\\u6280\\u672f\\uff08\\u53ef\\u6388\\u5de5\\u5b66\\u3001\\u7406\\u5b66\\u5b66\\u4f4d\\uff09; Astronomy & Astrophysics\",\"subject\":\"Coronal enhancement; Image processing; Radial local multi-scale filter; Solar corona; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66; \\u8ba1\\u7b97\\u673a\\u79d1\\u5b66\\u6280\\u672f; \\u7406\\u5b66; \\u5de5\\u5b66; Astronomy & Astrophysics\",\"authors\":\"Qiang, Zhenping; Bai, Xianyong; Ji KF(\\u5b63\\u51ef\\u5e06); Liu, Hui; Shang, Zhenhong\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/ir.ynao.ac.cn\\/handle\\/114a53\\/23402\",\"oa_state\":\"2\",\"url\":\"8394945256a0957dce10c1b438f1794b494f4ae392ec362a5a9b8a403d33315b\",\"relevance\":48},{\"id\":\"5da37e9dec96cc54187b2b67294cc67b7894c2947a0eac4be71ff58f2284dd07\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\/science\\/article\\/pii\\/S1818087619301515; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/toc\\/1818-0876; 1818-0876; doi:10.1016\\/j.ajps.2019.05.002; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/4459394c502745ca855a27683476253f\",\"identifier\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1016\\/j.ajps.2019.05.002; https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/4459394c502745ca855a27683476253f\",\"title\":\"In situ apolipoprotein E-enriched corona guides dihydroartemisinin-decorating nanoparticles towards LDLr-mediated tumor-homing chemotherapy\",\"paper_abstract\":\"The therapeutic efficiency of active targeting nanoparticulate drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) is highly compromised by the plasma proteins adsorption on nanoparticles (NPs) surface, which significantly hinders cell membrane receptors to recognize the designed ligands, and provokes the off-target toxicity and rapid clearance of NPs in vivo.

Without taking the underlying causes of viral zoonotic diseases into account, policy makers may end up implementing status-quo-perpetuating long-term fiscal measures that result in more, not less pandemics in the future.

Herein, we report an unbiased photoaffinity-based approach to capture, characterize, and quantify the protein corona of liposomes in their native state. Compared to conventional methods, our photoaffinity approach reveals markedly different interacting proteins as well as reduced total protein binding to liposome surfaces. Identified proteins do not follow protein abundancy patterns of human serum, as has been generally reported, but are instead dominated by soluble apolipoproteins-endogenous serum proteins that have evolved to recognize the lipidic surface of circulating lipoproteins.

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Mello & Worrell's (2007) time attitude, Paloutzian & Ellison's Spiritual Health (1983), and the researcher - constructed Aggression and Relationship quality Questionnaire were used to collect the data. Generalized anxiety had a positive effect on the level of aggression and a negative effect on the quality of relationship and positive attitude toward the future. Spiritual health mediated the adverse effects of pervasive anxiety on positive future attitudes and quality of relationship with the family, but didnt show mediating effect on aggression. Due to the mental threats of corona epidemic, the necessity of recognizing the mediating factors is clearly seen, and the findings of this study to confirm the mediating role of spiritual health provide a strategic tool for the country's psychologists and planners.

The technique improvement was based on using an elliptic PDE as well as a set of four boundary conditions. The PDE method can generate surfaces of geometries from a small number of parameters. Also, the shape of the surfaces, which is generated by the PDE method, is based on a boundary representation and it can easily be changed since it is described by data distributed around the boundaries. In this study, the shape of the generated PDE-based representation of a corona virus has been sketched by using MATLAB program. The results showed that the PDE method is appropriate for representing the shape of a corona virus. Besides that, the data, concerning the radius and height from the corona virus, are then used to get four equations. These equations can be used for future prediction in modeling COVID-19. In conclusion, the PDE method can produce smooth parametric surface representations of any given shapes of viruses.

The Covid-19 related restriction further suspended the normal affairs of states under an international environment of a health emergency. The pandemic crisis has clearly communicated to the international community that the digital world has arrived because the dependency on information technology has raised the significance of hi-tech communication networks in the world. This global crisis has endangered international society and the nations are struggling against the Covid-19 viral disease. No doubt, the whole international system has gradually learned to survive in the health crisis and the leaders from around the world are thinking of resuming normalization, but the actual question linked to the global governance in the post-corona world is unanswered. This pandemic year has raised the need for a serious conversation on the future of global political order because the Covid-19 has undermined the conventional wisdom attached to the crisis management mechanism of states. In short, the heating debates of the post-corona international political environment have generated a process of de-globalization and the international community is approaching a new world based on new realities. Therefore, this study is an endeavor to estimate the probable future scenario which will become an undeniable reality in the post-corona world.\",\"published_in\":\"Journal of Business and Social Review in Emerging Economies, Vol 6, Iss 2 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"Covid-19; Corona Epidemic; International System; World Politics; Business; HF5001-6182\",\"subject\":\"Covid- Corona Epidemic; International System; World Politics; Business; \",\"authors\":\"Attiq-ur-Rehman; Shahid Hussain Bukhari; Syed Mussawar Hussain Bukhari\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.26710\\/jbsee.v6i2.1154\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"569350494f7e84dfa61a5f1dcaecf23783f4b84e3a6ce14ad15f7cfc37bb616c\",\"relevance\":9},{\"id\":\"ce967c95af241b9b7e40669bc2d46f1a42235d1889ec166e90a4671cbf1848bd\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/annalskemu.org\\/journal\\/index.php\\/annals\\/article\\/view\\/3513\\/2132; http:\\/\\/annalskemu.org\\/journal\\/index.php\\/annals\\/article\\/view\\/3513\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/annalskemu.org\\/journal\\/index.php\\/annals\\/article\\/view\\/3513\",\"title\":\"Features of Corona Virus in Confirmed Elderly Patients in Lahore: Comparison with Young and Middle Aged\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Background: It was expected that Corona will spread in Pakistan, once first case was reported in late February 2020.

The corona mechanism in air is not exclusive to the field of energy applications but has also been widely studied by physicists to theorize mechanisms of charge transfer during the different phases of gas discharge. The phases of the discharge and its corresponding behavior with alternating voltage (AC) are well established and represented through various discharge trends, patterns and stages. This not only makes the identification of the PD defect possible but also helps evaluate the risk. This paper investigates corona configurations under DC stress in an attempt to create a similar outline of the defect as exists under AC. The defect is studied in terms of the pulse sequence information. The measurement system requirements are kept within a realistic realm to preserve applicability to industrial measurements.

Health authorities have identified many other people with COVID-19 around the world. On 31 March 2020, the virus spread more than 750890 People in the World. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency relating to COVID-19. Since then, this strain has been diagnosed in several residents of world. The CDC have advised that it is likely to spread to more people. COVID-19 has affected at least 213 countries or territories or areas. The first people with COVID-19 had links to an animal and seafood market. This fact suggested that animals initially transmitted the virus to humans. However, people with a more recent diagnosis had no connections with or exposure to the market, confirming that humans can pass the virus to each other. Corona viruses will infect most people at some time during their lifetime. Corona viruses can mutate effectively, which makes them so contagious. Information on the virus is scarce at present. In the past, respiratory conditions that develop from corona viruses, such as SARS and MERS, have spread through close contacts.

Our country imposed limited commuting to religious, recreational places and trading centers, closed schools and universities, decreased working hours, and cleaned crowded areas and passageways with disinfectants (subway stations, bus stations, and gas stations). Other efforts include: Establishing outposts in order to identify cases of Corona Virus at City entrances and Telephone screening through 4030\\\"that is a hotline for COVID-19 detection and providing relevant health information1.\\\" Despite the necessary precautions taken, there were problems in fighting the Corona Disease, the most important of which include: Insufficiency regarding personal protective equipment like masks, disinfectants and hospital gowns,3 Inadequate number of hospital beds and equipment in some of the cities and shortage of health workers. This issue has caused a high concern in the society and amongst the health workers who take care of Corona virus cases in hospitals. Also, due to the experienced mental disorders of the health care workers while COVID-19 outbreak,4 the role of such shortages in the fight against this disease is crucial. In a situation like this where the number of infected people shoots up, hygienic needs of Iran increases, too. A new trend in fighting the disease has begun. In this trend, different groups of people like clerics and cleric students, Basij, medical and non-medical students have taken measures in fighting the Corona Virus which are in line with the World health organization and Ministry of Health and Medical Education standards. These measures are taken in 4 general areas, including: 1. disinfecting the pssageways (Streets, Alleys), highly populated areas (Trading Centers, Bus and Subway stations, Gas stations) and vehicles, 2. producing personal protective equipment (Masks, face shields, gowns and disinfectants), 3. helping with the Telephone Screening by Medical students, and 4. Volunteer medical students participation in health care centers and hospitals. Now, despite the exigent circumstances regarding the spread of COVID-19 worldwide, volunteer measures and organized activities in Iran have led to provision of telephone screening information and details about the COVID-19 to more than 65 million people until March 31, 2020;5 and production of thousands of hygienic products daily has had a significant role in controlling and fighting the Corona Virus Pandemic. Although in the early period of the virus outbreak, Iran was the third country to have the most cases of Corona positive cases after China and Korea until 2nd of March, and the number of identified cases increased in April 15, 2020 which might be due to the efficient and comprehensive screening process, it became the 8th country with the most positive cases of Corona after the United States, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, England, and China.2 It is also expected that with adequate health equipment, specialized human resources and provision of scientific information to the community, the public and health workers who take care of Corona virus cases will have tranquility. Therefore, Iran\\u2019s approach towards facing the COVID-19 clearly states the fact that national approach in fighting the Corona Virus is an important factor among other measures taken and it is mentioned as a modern approach in managing a health crisis in a large scale.\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery, Vol 8, Iss 3, Pp 275-276 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"covid-19; iran; national approach; Medicine; R; Nursing; RT1-120\",\"subject\":\"covid- iran; national approach; Medicine; R; Nursing; \",\"authors\":\"Tayebe Pourghaznein; Sina Salati\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.30476\\/ijcbnm.2020.85928.1308\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"aaab1362e291b767514658499da220532bdb4142ed2fc81a1e295715a635085c\",\"relevance\":3},{\"id\":\"d0dc3fceb175672c875b575e97e5f44bf7a002938ede0d9739cd780cb02f7231\",\"relation\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.sbmu.ac.ir\\/en-jhf\\/article\\/view\\/30950\\/19999; http:\\/\\/journals.sbmu.ac.ir\\/en-jhf\\/article\\/view\\/30950\",\"identifier\":\"http:\\/\\/journals.sbmu.ac.ir\\/en-jhf\\/article\\/view\\/30950\",\"title\":\"Criteria to evaluate the communities\\u2019 plan and action against the corona virus\",\"paper_abstract\":\"Abstract Talking about evaluation of countries and communities\\u2019 responses to corona virus needs specific criteria; some of them are discussed in this manuscript as below: 1-Population: Count and structure of population affect the outcome of COVID-19 management, the elder population are more prone to mortality and morbidity from corona virus. 2-The Economic, Political and Social structure of the country: Given the experience gained, this is probably the most effective component on the outcome of Corona pandemic. 3-Solidarity and integrated managerial system coupled with people-centered politics are another issues that should be taken into more consideration in any evaluation process. Communities such as China, eastern and south-eastern countries which received orders and executions from one source were more successful. At the same time, communities such as England and the United States have suffered partly due to their unintegrated domestic policy. Despite the delay, thanks to the presence of a unified leadership and coherent management as well as community participation, our country was among the successful communities. 4-Structure of Health Delivery System (HDS): Universal coverage is an indicator to evaluate HDS. The more public health coverage, the more successful would be the plan. Iran, Scandinavian communities and Southeast Asian countries with their good universal coverage were more successful than western countries. It is worth noting here that England is an exceptional country owing to its good universal coverage based on leveling of services, referral system; however, its success was affected by its economic and political status as well as financial payments index which has been mainly defined for medical services. 5-Health Facilities: Efficacy of this item was under controlled by national economic and political managerial system and universal health coverage at health delivery system. The United States, for example, reveals 2 to 3 times as many manpower and hospital beds and equipment as many eastern and western communities. However, the public suffered from COVID-19 due to the poor socio-economic structure. Conflicts in providing these facilities further tarnished the image of the West. Iran otherwise of US sanctions did a good job regarding producing health facilities and even could exporte them. 6- Knowledge responding to corona virus: The experience and knowledge of responding to COVID-19 were distributed fast all over the globe and used by health providers; however, MOLECULLAR CELULLAR and DIGITAL sciences made difference among the countries.

Differentiation with histone-deacetylase inhibitor, vorinostat (SAHA), can induce stem cells to differentiate as well as enforces non-CSCs to reprogram to CSCs. To avoid this undesirable effect, one can block the Wnt-\\u03b2catenin pathway. Thus, a dual delivery system of SAHA and a Wnt-\\u03b2catenin blocker will be beneficial in the induction of differentiation of CSCs. Protein corona (PC) formation in nanoparticle has a biologic milieu, and despite all problematic properties, it can be employed as a medium for dual loading of the drugs.Materials and Methods: We prepared sphere gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with human plasma protein corona loaded with SAHA as differentiating agent and PKF118-310 (PKF) as a Wnt-\\u03b2catenin antagonist. The MCF7 breast cancer stem cells were treated with NPs and the viability and differentiation were evaluated by Western blotting and sphere formation assay.Results: We found that both drugs loaded onto corona-capped GNPs had significant cytotoxicity in comparison to bare GNP-corona. Data demonstrated an increase in stem cell population and upregulation of mesenchymal marker, Snail by SAHA-loaded GNPs treatment; however, the combination of PKF loaded GNPs along with SAHA-loaded GNPs resulted in a reduction of stem cell populations and Snail marker. We have shown that in MCF7 and its CSCs simultaneous treatment with SAHA and PKF118-310 induced differentiation and inhibition of Snail induction.Conclusion: Our study reveals the PC-coated GNPs as a biocompatible career for both hydrophilic (PKF) and hydrophobic (SAHA) agents which can decrease breast cancer stem cell populations along with reduced stemness state regression.Keywords: co-delivery, HDAC inhibitor, Wnt, cancer stem cell, protein corona\",\"published_in\":\"International Journal of Nanomedicine, Vol Volume 15, Pp 4063-4078 (2020)\",\"year\":\"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z\",\"subject_orig\":\"co-delivery; hdac inhibitor; wnt; cancer stem cell; protein corona; Medicine (General); R5-920\",\"subject\":\"co-delivery; hdac inhibitor; wnt; cancer stem cell; protein corona; \",\"authors\":\"Shamsian A; Sepand MR; Javaheri Kachousangi M; Dara T; Ostad SN; Atyabi F; Ghahremani MH\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doaj.org\\/article\\/b4650ada388f487aa13cc5d87add8265\",\"oa_state\":\"1\",\"url\":\"22d826b74c228bd13bdb1f8051ec6f675ccb31502e04f43d6c5b00fbd99a826e\",\"relevance\":1}]",

Method The corona mortis was dissected out of eight adult cadavers and were simulated for the insertion of the anterior ring minimally invasive plate, and the presence of the anastomotic branch (the corona mortis) in the suprapubic branch area was observed. After the Corona mortis stripped off, the data was measured, such as the length, vessel diameter, distance from the pubic tubercle, and the maximum vertical distance between the corona mortis and the pubis. The measured data and the previous literatures were analyzed to study the morphology of the corona mortis and the position relation between the corona mortis and the placement of subperiosteal tunnel through the minimally invasive ilioinguinal approach. Results Out of the 16 unilateral pelvises, the corona mortis were observed on 12 unilateral pelvises with an incidence rate of 75%. Amongst them, there were seven cases of vein anastomosis (incidence of 43.75%), three cases of arterial anastomosis (incidence of 18.75%), and two cases of both arterial anastomosis and vein anastomosis (incidence of 12.5%). The corona mortis length ranged between 24.5 and 37.5 mm (average of 30.7 \\u00b1 3.6 mm); the diameter ranged between 1.6 and 3.5 mm (average of 2.5 \\u00b1 0.5 mm) and the distance between the vessels and the pubic tubercle was between 53.9 and 65.2 mm (average of 59.0 \\u00b1 3.6 mm). Above the pubis, the corona mortis originated from the iliac or the inferior epigastric vessel. It crossed the pubic branch to the dorsal side of the pubis and proceeded downward to anastomize with the obturator vessels near the obturator. Toothless tweezers were used to peel and lift up the corona mortis from the pubic bone. The maximum vertical distance between the corona mortis and the pubis ranged between 8.8 and 18.3 mm (average of 12.6 \\u00b1 3.0 mm). Conclusion The corona mortis have a high rate of incidence, with a large number of differences in the type and shape of blood vessels among patients. Following peeling, the movement between the corona mortis and pubic bone is limited. Nevertheless, the plate and bone exfoliator still passed safely. Therefore, when surgeons use the minimally invasive ilioinguinal approach to establish channels, the process of subperiosteal stripping must be performed to avoid any accidental injury.

In this paper, we carry out detailed investigations of magnetic-reconnection heating to the corona, specifically, studying how the disc and corona are self-consistently coupled with the magnetic field, and how the emergent spectra depend on the fundamental parameters of AGN. It is shown that diverse spectral shapes and luminosities over a broad bandpass from optical to X-ray can be produced from the coupled disc and corona within a limited range of the black hole mass, accretion rate, and magnetic field strength. The relative strength of X-ray emission with respect to optical\\/ultraviolet (UV) depends on the strength of the magnetic field in the disc, which, together with accretion rate, determines the fraction of accretion energy transported and released in the corona. This refined disc-corona model is then applied to reproduce the broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a sample of 20 bright local AGNs observed simultaneously in X-ray and optical\\/UV. We find that, in general, the overall observed broad-band SEDs can be reasonably reproduced, except for rather hard X-ray spectral shapes in some objects. The radiation pressure-dominant region, as previously predicted for the standard accretion disc in AGN, disappears for strong X-ray sources, revealing that AGN accretion discs are indeed commonly stable as observed. Our study suggests the disc-corona coupling model involving magnetic fields to be a promising approach for understanding the broad-band spectra of bright AGNs. accretion; accretion discs; magnetic fields; galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66::\\u5929\\u4f53\\u7269\\u7406\\u5b66; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66::\\u5929\\u4f53\\u7269\\u7406\\u5b66::\\u9ad8\\u80fd\\u5929\\u4f53\\u7269\\u7406\\u5b66; \\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66::\\u661f\\u7cfb\\u4e0e\\u5b87\\u5b99\\u5b66; \\u7406\\u5b66; \\u7406\\u5b66::\\u5929\\u6587\\u5b66; Astronomy & Astrophysics; X-RAY-SPECTRA; ADVECTION-DOMINATED ACCRETION; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; BLACK-HOLES; EMISSION; ULTRAVIOLET; TEMPERATURE; REFLECTION; TRANSITION; VISCOSITY  Cheng, Huaqing; Liu, B.

Examples include compact structure design and uprating existing transmission lines. Recent research relating electric field uniformity to transmission line capacity and critical flashover voltage underscored the need for better overvoltage data to quantify insulation margins for HSIL design. To that end, this work extends the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method with distributed corona losses to transmission lines with bundled conductors. The model was adapted for practical use in high-volume statistical transient simulation and applied to an example 500 kV line. Transients included line energization and trapped charge reclosing. Overvoltage profiles and statistical distributions were generated from 9500 simulations obtained by random breaker close timing and variation in line length and altitude. Distributed corona losses reduced 98th percentile line-to-ground switching overvoltages by 4%\\u201314% of nominal. The estimated line-to-ground switching surge flashover probability was 54%\\u201380% lower with corona loss. Corona had less impact on line-to-line overvoltages, but the effects were still notable. Results highlight the importance of considering detailed overvoltage profiles and accounting for corona loss attenuation when seeking to carefully quantify insulation design margins. power; transmission; corona; overvoltage; switching; insulation; Technology; T Energies, Vol 13, Iss 2474, p 2474 (2020) Jon T.

When the corona virus outbreak hit Indonesia, the state of the country was not ready to deal with it, so that a quick reaction to prevention socialization had not yet been carried out by Indonesia. Finally, the spread of the corona virus epidemic is very bad for all Indonesian people, because many Indonesians affected by the transmission of this virus, including the health team, are the main group in handling this virus outbreak. Therefore, the government adopted a policy to provide incentives for health teams that fought against the corona virus to benefit the health team and the general public. The study uses a normative legal method with three approaches namely; statute approach, case approach, and philosophical approach. Data was obtained from government policies on presidential policies, policies of the Governor of DKI Jakarta, and other policies. The results of the study stated that the health team is the main group that fights against the corona virus with a very high risk, so the government needs to provide incentives as an effort to benefit and support the health team in fighting the corona covid-19 virus.Keywords: Covid-19, Policy, Incentives. Abstrak Indonesia merupakan salah satu Negara terserang virus corona yang terjadi pada awal 2020. Pada saat wabah virus corona menimpa Indonesia, keadaan negara belum siap untuk menghadapinya, sehingga reaksi cepat sosialisasi pencegahan belum sempat dilakukan oleh Indonesia. Akhirnya penyebaran wabah virus corona ini menjadi hal yang sangat buruk bagi seluruh masyarakat Indonesia, karena banyak warga Indonesia yang terkena dampak penularan virus ini termasuk para tim kesehatan yang menjadi kelompok utama dalam menangani wabah virus ini. Oleh karenanya, pemerintah mengambil kebijakan untuk memberikan insentif bagi tim kesehatan yang berperang melawan virus corona guna memberikan kemaslahatan bagi tim kesehatan dan masyarakat umum. Penelitian menggunakan metode hukum normatif dengan tiga pendekatan yaitu; statute approach, case approach, dan philosophical approach. Data diperoleh dari kebijakan pemerintah kebijakan presiden, kebijakan gubernur DKI Jakarta, serta kebijakan lainnya.

Electrostatic precipitators are very useful as a means to reduce emissions from heavy industry factories. This paper aims to examine the performance of wire-duct electrostatic precipitators (WDESP) as affected by high-temperature incoming gases with a varying number of discharge wires while increasing their radius. The precipitator performance is expressed in terms of the corona onset voltage on the stressed wires and the corona current\\u2013voltage (I\\u2013V) characteristic of the precipitators working with incoming gases at high temperatures. The start of the corona onset voltage on the surface of the discharge wires is calculated for the precipitators under high temperatures based on the standard of the self-repeat of avalanches\\u2019 electrons developing on the surface of the stressed wires at high temperatures. For this, calculating the electrostatic field in the precipitators with single- and multi-discharge wires due to the stressed wire with the use of the well-known charge simulation method (CSM) with high-temperature incoming gases is important. The modeling of corona I\\u2013V characteristics is adopted using the finite element method (FEM) for single- and multi- (3-, 5-, and 7-) discharge wires of WDESP with high-temperature incoming gases. Additionally, the electrostatic field, potential, and space charge of WDESP are calculated by a simultaneous solution of equations of Poisson, current density, and the continuity current density. A WDESP was set up in the Laboratory of High Voltage Engineering of Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague, the Czech Republic, to measure the corona onset voltage values and corona I\\u2013V characteristics for different WDESP configurations at high temperatures with a varying number of discharge wires while increasing their radius. The calculated values of the corona onset voltage based on CSM and the calculated corona I\\u2013V characteristics based on FEM agree reasonably with those measured experimentally with high-temperature WDESP. modeling of corona discharge; finite element method; electrostatic precipitators; corona-onset voltage; corona I\\u2013V characteristic; high-temperature incoming gases; Mathematics; QA1-939 Mathematics, Vol 8, Iss 1406, p 1406 (2020) Hamdy A.

As a multifaceted phenomenon, corona-virus prevalence is much more significant than other simple medical conditions. It involves several dimensions including dynamism, complicated, extensiveness, variety, and depth. It can accelerate or slow down grand global trends including the impressive trend of smart virtualization by the multinational nongovernmental specialist companies for realization of the global village. Hence, at present, numerous scientific researches regarding various aspects of crisis management, including health and biology, economics, technology, culture and sociology, ethics, spirituality, politics, security, inter nationality and law, as well as the future of corona-virus and the post-corona world are being held on the phenomenon of corona-virus prevalence by universities and scientific centers in the world. These scientific researches and experiments by individuals and institutions, all together, are creating new knowledge in various scientific fields. Therefore, it seems necessary to concentrate on knowledge management in the crisis of corona-virus prevalence. Knowledge offers a firm foundation for intelligent, correct, and timely behavior at individual, group, organizational, national, and global levels. Conscious and systematized reflection on the lessons learned from the corona-virus outbreak, as well as the proper methods discovered, makes it possible for people to take the best advantage from the knowledge they have gained with difficulty. Furthermore, it seems necessary to design and apply the architecture of knowledge gained by the corona-virus prevalence to enable step-by-step processing and knowledge transformation in different fields through an interdisciplinary approach (just as knowledge products are processed), and to ensure that the acquired knowledge is provided to the end-users and are used appropriately. Based on a review and meta-analysis of theoretical literature relating to the main approaches to knowledge management cycles, knowledge management cycle in the corona-virus outbreak crisis can be presented in the following three main stages: 1) Acquisition or creation of the knowledge derived from corona; 2) Targeted distribution or general sharing of knowledge derived from corona; 3) Understanding and applying the knowledge derived from corona. knowledge management; knowledge management cycle; coronavirus; Management.

Tulisan ini menyajikan dua masalah pokok. Pertama, apakah pandemi corona dapat dijadikan sebagai alasan pemutusan hubungan kerja pekerja oleh perusahaan? kedua, bagaimana perlindungan hak pekerja yang diputus hubungan kerjannya oleh perusahaan menurut UU Ketenagakerjaan? Melalui kajian secara yuridis normatif, diperoleh penjelasan bahwa pengusaha dapat menggunakan pandemi corona sebagai alasan force majeure untuk melakukan PHK karena: berpengaruh terhadap keuangan dan kewajiban perusahaan kepada pekerja; merupakan peristiwa yang sifatnya tidak terduga; serta corona sebagai bencana nonalam berskala nasional. Selain alasan force majeure, efisiensi juga menjadi alasan untuk melakukan PHK. PHK karena alasan force majeure melahirkan hak bagi pekerja sesuai ketentuan Pasal 164 ayat (1), sedangkan bila PHK karena alasan efisiensi, maka hak pekerja sesuai ketentua Pasal 164 ayat (3) UU Ketenagakerjaan.Kata kunci: pandemi corona, pemutusan hubungan kerja, force majeure, efisiensi Hukum Perdata Yurispruden: Jurnal Fakultas Hukum Universitas Islam Malang; Vol 3, No 2 (2020): Yurispruden: Jurnal Fakultas Hukum Universitas Islam Malang; 119-136 ; 2614-3992 ; 2614-3852 Randi, Yusuf\"},{\"id\":\"ba73ed30a322d0e4296417d03dba9365eedcb70b57109c671f2172b25b8c5fe5\",\"content\":\"Experimental Study of the Corona Performance of Aged Sand-Cast Substation Connectors Substation connectors, like many other high-voltage products, are tested once manufactured. However, the corona behavior of aged specimens can differ from that exhibited by newer ones, thus generating detrimental technical and environmental effects. Manufacturers need to know the long-term corona behavior of substation connectors to offer their customers maximum safety and transparency about such critical products. This paper analyzes the ageing effect on the surface roughness and the visual corona extinction voltage of sand-cast aluminum connectors, which were artificially aged in a salt spray chamber for different periods. The experimental results show an important variability of the surface roughness and corona extinction voltage (CEV) among connectors with the same ageing level due to the sand-casting manufacturing process. The results in this paper also show a slight increase in the surface roughness with the ageing period, although there is not a clear pattern between the applied ageing level and the experimental CEV value. It is concluded that the inherent variability among connectors due to the sand-cast process has more influence than the ageing effect itself. corona effect; ageing; substation connectors; high-voltage; sand casting; Technology; T Energies, Vol 13, Iss 2785, p 2785 (2020) Jordi-Roger Riba; Santiago Bogarra; \\u00c1lvaro G\\u00f3mez-Pau; Manuel Moreno-Eguilaz\"},{\"id\":\"8211e3dda0440cd42548aadcf66cf49d093c9bf28ef8b3b8506b2edf4fef6036\",\"content\":\"CATASTROPHE BY AN INVISIBLE GUEST- 2019 & ONGOING DRUG TRAILS ALONG WITH THE STATUS OF VACCINE PREPARATION Within the first fifty days of the epidemic outbreak of novel corona virus in Wuhan, had killed more than eighteen hundred and infected over seventy thousand individuals.

Corona virus is one of the health problems that really needs our attention now. Because this virus can cause death, and the way the virus is transmitted is very easy and fast. There are many things that can be done to reduce the spread of this virus to the territory of Indonesia, one of which is to identify the body temperature of each passenger on international arrivals at the airport. At the airport the identification of this virus is done by using Artificial Intelligence. One of the things that is the goal of developing artificial intelligence (AI) is to help humans. This often means imitating the abilities and intelligence of the person he is trying to help or replace. The tool used is the Thermal Scanner Camera that can see directly the body temperature of the passenger. And there are several kits that have been made to check directly whether there is a corona virus in the human body by using the Rapid Test and PCR Test. This research was conducted to see how important AI (artificial intelligence) is in helping reduce the spread of corona virus.

Prevention strategies to control the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as closing of schools, refraining from gathering, and social distancing, have direct impacts on mental well-being. SARS-CoV-2 has a devastating psychological impact on the mental health status of the community and, particularly when associated with psychotic symptoms, it could affect the overall quality-of-life. The virus also has the potential to enter and infect the brain. As a result, psychosis symptoms could be an emerging phenomenon associated with the corona virus pandemic. The presence of psychotic symptoms may complicate the management options of patients with COVID-19.Objective: The aim of this article review is to elaborate the relationships between COVID-19 and psychotic symptoms.Methodology: We independently searched different electronic databases, such as Google scholar, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and other relevant sources published in English globally, by using the search terms \\u201cpsychosis and COVID-19\\u201d, \\u201ccorona virus\\u201d, \\u201cbrief psychotic\\u201d, \\u201cschizophrenia\\u201d, \\u201corganic psychosis\\u201d, \\u201cinfectious disease\\u201d, \\u201cmental illness\\u201d, \\u201cpandemics\\u201d, and \\u201cpsychiatry\\u201d in various permutations and combinations.Results: The results of the included studies revealed that patients with a novel corona virus had psychotic symptoms, including hallucination in different forms of modality, delusion, disorganized speech, and grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviors. The patients with COVID-19-related psychotic symptoms had responded with a short-term administration of the antipsychotic medication.Conclusion and Recommendation: A corona virus-related psychosis has been identified in different nations, but it is difficult to conclude that a novel corona virus has been biologically related to psychosis or exacerbates psychotic symptoms. Therefore, to identify the causal relationships between COVID-19 and psychosis, the researchers should investigate the prospective study on the direct biological impacts of COVID-19 and psychosis, and the clinicians should pay attention for psychotic symptoms at the treatment center and isolation rooms in order to reduce the complication of a novel corona virus.Keywords: COVID-19, psychosis, SARS-CoV-2, 2020 covid-19; psychosis; sars-cov-2; 2020; Psychology; BF1-990; Industrial psychology; HF5548.7-5548.85 Psychology Research and Behavior Management, Vol Volume 13, Pp 701-704 (2020) Tariku M; Hajure M\"},{\"id\":\"2243a272084636f7e8acf5d76af769b2fef1644a6f8d6f7363cebf52470b721d\",\"content\":\"Riems: Forscher testen Corona-Impfstoff - an Frettchen Forscher des Friedrich-Loeffler-Instituts (FLI) auf der Insel Riems bei Greifswald testen derzeit einen m\\u00f6glichen Impfstoff gegen das Coronavirus.

Generally, infection caused by Corona viruses progresses asymptomatically in healthy children and rarely causes morbidity and mortality. Despite this fact, the infection may cause a severe clinical picture in the elderly and adults and children with predisposing underlying disease. The novel Corona virus outbreak, which started in China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over the world and turned into a pandemic. This pandemic, named as COVID-19 by WHO (World Health Organisation), caused economic and social losses all over the world and caused more than 450,000 deaths worldwide up to 21 June. COVID-19, whose specific antiviral therapy and preventive vaccine is not yet available, is still the most serious health problem in the world.Keywords: Coronaviruses, Pandemic, Pediatrics, Children COVID-19,Pandemi,Pediyatri,\\u00c7ocuk Volume: 3, Issue: \\u00d6zel Say\\u0131 140-148 ; 2651-4184 ; Medical Research Reports \\u00c7\\u0130FT\\u00c7\\u0130, Mustafa\"},{\"id\":\"fdddbaaada7e8439d8e8dbdae7f81b2cd9c74bcc2a795cf1c14d3f2fe37e7e0f\",\"content\":\"Experimental study of the corona performance of aged sand-cast substation connectors Substation connectors, like many other high-voltage products, are tested once manufactured. However, the corona behavior of aged specimens can differ from that exhibited by newer ones, thus generating detrimental technical and environmental effects. Manufacturers need to know the long-term corona behavior of substation connectors to offer their customers maximum safety and transparency about such critical products. This paper analyzes the ageing effect on the surface roughness and the visual corona extinction voltage of sand-cast aluminum connectors, which were artificially aged in a salt spray chamber for different periods. The experimental results show an important variability of the surface roughness and corona extinction voltage (CEV) among connectors with the same ageing level due to the sand-casting manufacturing process. The results in this paper also show a slight increase in the surface roughness with the ageing period, although there is not a clear pattern between the applied ageing level and the experimental CEV value. It is concluded that the inherent variability among connectors due to the sand-cast process has more influence than the ageing effect itself. ; This research was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\\u00f3n de Espa\\u00f1a, grant number RTC-2017-6297-3 and by the Generalitat de Catalunya, grant number 2017 SGR 967. ; Peer Reviewed ; Postprint (published version) \\u00c0rees tem\\u00e0tiques de la UPC::Enginyeria el\\u00e8ctrica::Alta tensi\\u00f3; High voltages; Electric conductors; Sand; Corona effect; Ageing; Substation connectors; High-voltage; Sand casting; Alta tensi\\u00f3; Conductors el\\u00e8ctrics; Sorra  Riba Ruiz, Jordi-Roger; Bogarra Rodr\\u00edguez, Santiago; G\\u00f3mez Pau, \\u00c1lvaro; Moreno Eguilaz, Juan Manuel\"},{\"id\":\"76ccb51aa0c7e8e73d19c4e9ec3303e7580c3a3d614ffdbcd6538a9e2a7353bc\",\"content\":\"Corona And Paul Celan Or Love And Pandemic\\/ Corona ve Paul Celan Ya da A\\u015fk ve Pandemi The year 2020 has already taken place in history pages as a year of pandemic in which the coronavirus outbreak has taken millions of lives all over the world. This year also coincides with the 50th anniversary of the death of Paul Celan (1920-1970), one of the well-known poets of the post-war Austrian lyric. Interestingly, Celan named his poem Corona, which he wrote seventy-two years ago. The year 1948 corresponds to three years after the end of the Second World War in world history. In Celan\\u2019s personal history these years coincide with tough times, when he emigrated to Czernowitz, Bucharest and then Vienna after surviving the Nazi death camp where his parents were sacrificed. The friendships that Celan built here with the writers around the literature in Vienna, especially meeting the Austrian poet Ingeborg Bachmann (1926-1973), constitute a turning point in his life. Two great poets experience passionate love. This poem of Celan carries traces of this stormy love in 1948. The main purpose of this study is to analyze this poem and also to investigate whether there is a relationship between Corona and Celan\\u2019s poem with the same title, which is known as the name of the pandemic virus that has killed millions of people today.

This is the first study to investigate mental health, i. e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. RESULTS: Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. DISCUSSION: Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too. Specific psychotherapeutic interventions, targeting at cognitive restructuring and sensitizing regarding dealing with alcohol and cigarettes, may be needed in order to protect this vulnerable group of person during and after the Corona pandemic.

Using observations with the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter, we have determined the spatial distribution of the plasma density in the corona, and the phase speed of the prevailing transverse magnetohydrodynamic waves within the plasma. We combine these measurements to map the plane-of-sky component of the global coronal magnetic field. The derived field strengths in the corona from 1.05 to 1.35 solar radii are mostly 1-4 Gauss. These results demonstrate the capability of imaging spectroscopy in coronal magnetic field diagnostics.

For this reason, protein corona evolution and biodistribution of different chitosan (Ch)-based nanoparticles including Ch and carboxymethyl dextran (CMD)\\/thiolated dextran (TD) polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) were studied using highly precious and sensitive methods such as liquid chromatography-mass\\/mass (LC-MS\\/MS) spectroscopy and positron emission tomography\\/computed tomography (PET\\/CT) scan.

COVID-19, a pandemic is spreading its web throughout the world affecting everyone resulting into mass destruction of populations causing human suffering, creating panic, disturbing everyone economically and stressing all kind of development of entire mankind. COVID-19 is a deadly disease that is supposed to be fatal in 4% of cases. In Severe cases this disease produces enormous respiratory harm like pneumonia, gastrointestinal disorders, weakened immune systems, kidney failure or evendeath. The pathology of COVID-19 is just similar to SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) corona virus infection. There are no drugs or vaccines for corona viruses yet, including COVID-19.

The global outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) challenged the medical facilities and services all over worldwide with more than 200 countries affected by the pandemic effects. The Corona viruses (CoV) belong to the genus Corona virus in the Corona viridae. All CoVs are pleomorphic RNA viruses characteristically containing crown-shape peplomers with 80-160 nM in size and 27-32 kb positive polarity. Recombination rates of CoVs are very high because of constantly developing transcription errors and RNA dependent on the RNA polymerase (RdRP) jump. World Health Organization and Indian government are taking many efforts to control the spread of the virus rapidly among humans. All over country followed many Strategies such as self-quarantine, social distancing and 40-days countrywide lockdown helped to slow down the virus which could have spread tremendously otherwise specially paying attention to Tamilnadu state current situation. Our critical review focuses on the implications of Covid-19 in India especially Tamilnadu current scenario along with report and strategies employed for the pandemic control.

EGARCH (1,1) Model is applied to determine the relationship between the market returns of sectoral indices along with the panic generated due to media coverage about the corona virus outbreak. Imposition of mobility control in terms of Lockdown has exerted the significant impact on stock market and sectoral indices returns.

This is a highly infectious disease and spreads rapidly in the community worldwide. On 30 January 2020, Coronavirus outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. In this pandemic situation where the novel corona virus continuously spreading day by day worldwide, the researcher are focused on finding new ways to destroy the coronavirus. Because airborne transmission appears to plays an important role in the spread of coronavirus, UV light would be able to destroy the novel corona virus when exposure to UVC irradiation stronger than 90 \\u00b5W\\/cm2. Devices using UV light, emits high-intensity rays could help to kill the novel coronavirus. In order to kill the novel corona virus, very high levels of ultraviolet light is required ranges from 200 to 300 nanometer. In this paper we will highlight the various application of UV light to kill the viruses and protect from disinfection areas contaminated from the novel corona virus (COVID-19). We will also highlight the basic study on coronavirus and how it was outbreak worldwide in the year 2020.

This cloud of protein aggregates hampers the targeting and transport capabilities of the NPs, thereby compromising their biomedical applications. Therefore, there is a high interest in the development of technologies that allow control over PC formation, as this would provide a handle to manipulate NPs in biological fluids. We present a strategy that enables the reversible disruption of the PC using external stimuli, thereby allowing a precise regulation of NP cellular uptake. The approach, demonstrated for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), is based on a biorthogonal, supramolecular host-guest interactions between an anionic dye bound to the AuNP surface and a positively charged macromolecular cage. This supramolecular complex effectively behaves as a zwitterionic NP ligand, which is able not only to prevent PC formation but also to disrupt a previously formed hard corona. With this supramolecular stimulus, the cellular internalization of AuNPs can be enhanced by up to 30-fold in some cases, and even NP cellular uptake in phagocytic cells can be regulated. Additionally, we demonstrate that the conditional cell uptake of purposely designed gold nanorods can be used to selectively enhance photothermal cell death.

Virus Corona adalah virus yang menyerang sistem pernafasan yang bisa menyebabkan gangguan pernafasan, pneumonia akut, sampai kematian. Infeksi virus ini disebut COVID-19 dan pertama kali ditemukan di kota Wuhan, Tiongkok, pada akhir Desember 2019. Virus ini menular dengan cepat dan telah menyebar ke wilayah lain di Tiongkok dan ke beberapa negara termasuk Indonesia. Pada tanggal 2 Maret 2020, Presiden Republik Indonesia, Joko Widodo resmi mengumumkan bahwa ada dua WNI yang positif COVID-19. Informasi ini pun resmi diberitakan oleh berbagai media massa khususnya televisi dengan angle yang beragam. Sebagai saluran berbasis audio-visual, televisi masih diangggap alat yang ampuh untuk membentuk opini publik. Dengan menggunakan pendekatan Analisis Framing Zhongdang Pan dan Gerald M.Kosicki, identifikasi tentang penggunaan televisi untuk kepentingan publik diklasifikasikan dengan melakukan analisis empat struktur framing besar yaitu sintaksis, skrip, tematik, dan retoris. Dari analisis tersebut ditemukan perbedaan framing dalam konten pemberitaan yang disiarkan oleh 2 televisi swasta yang ada di Indonesia, TV One dan Kompas TV. TV One membingkai pemberitaan virus Corona dengan mengedepankan kepanikan dan ketakutan, sedangkan Kompas TV lebih fokus kepada upaya penanganan dan solusi pencegahan.

While it is of value to find out the theoretical values of design parameters using three-dimensional finite element model and numerical method, this study shows that employ-ing a two-dimensional finite element model and easily usable public-domain program is equally simple and fast. Variations of some physical properties occurring between an electrode and a duct are expressed using two design parameters. In this process, the design of the experi-ment and the response surface method are used based on the two-dimensional finite element model, as well as electrostatic simulation. A test using an electrostatic precipitator is performed and it is confirmed that a variation of corona power by the test is most similar with the varia-tion of stored energy by the simulation. A conversion factor that can predict corona power with the response surface function for the stored energy is proposed.

A numerical model, based on the shell technique applied on reduced magnetohydrodynamics equations, is used to represent energy injection due to footpoint motions, storage and dissipation of energy in a coronal loop. Motions at the loop bases are simulated by random signals whose frequency-wavenumber spectrum reproduces features of photospheric motions: the p -mode peak and the low-frequency continuum. Results indicate that a turbulent state develops, dominated by magnetic energy, where dissipation takes place in an intermittent fashion. The nonlinear cascade is mainly controlled by velocity fluctuations, where resonant modes are dominant at high frequencies. Low frequency fluctuations present a power-law spectra and a bump at p -mode frequency; similar features are observed in velocity spectra detected in the corona.

A total of six species have been identified to cause disease in humans. They are known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems. The past few decades have seen endemic outbreaks in the form of Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome related corona virus (SARS-CoV). Yet again, we see the emergence of another outbreak due to a new strain called the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The most recent outbreak initially presented as pneumonia of unknown aetiology in a cluster of patients in Wuhan, China. The epicentre of infection was linked to seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets in the city. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has resulted in a rapid pandemic of COVID-19. As the number of cases continues to rise, it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health. This review will introduce a general overview of corona virus and describe the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients. It will also provide a means to raise awareness among primary and secondary healthcare providers during the current pandemic.

A variety of cardiovascular presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described so far. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the right ventricle is largely unknown. Due to its pathophysiologic relevance, the right ventricle finds itself in the eye of the storm of corona virus disease of 2019, placing it at higher risk of failure. Increased afterload from acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary embolism, negative inotropic effects of cytokines, and direct angiotensin converting enzyme 2-mediated cardiac injury from SARS-CoV-2 are potential mechanisms of right ventricle dysfunction in corona virus disease of 2019.

Therefore, processing these images is important for determining various types of information. However, it is very difficult to elucidate the intricate structure of the corona because of the steep radial gradient in terms of brightness and the large differences in brightness within local areas of coronal images. In this study, we present a filter inspired by the normalizing-radial-graded filter, which we call the radial local multi-scale filter (RLMF). The RLMF method extracts radial vectors and performs local multi-scale filtering based on each vector, before normalizing the vector in order to enhance coronal images. This method facilitates the enhancement of large-scale structural characteristics and fine details in low contrast regions. To demonstrate the power of the RLMF, we applied the proposed method to Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph C2 and K-Coronagraph observations. The RLMF method more clearly revealed the fine details of the corona and CMEs compared with the original observations.

Herein, we report a novel dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-decorating nano-DDS that in situ specifically recruits endogenous apolipoprotein E (apoE) on the NPs surface. The apoE-anchored corona is able to prolong PLGA-PEG2000-DHA (PPD) NPs circulation capability in blood, facilitate NPs accumulating in tumor cells by the passive enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr)-mediated target transport, and ultimately improve the in vivo antitumor activity.

The post-Corona recession is being met by long-term fiscal policy measures to counteract the adverse economic effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. In many cases, these measures are guided by old paradigm economic thinking that aim at a return to the pre-pandemic status quo of the Anthropocene. However, measures preventing pandemics in the long run are, to a large extent, identical to the measures needed for a global transition to sustainable ways of living within the physical limits of the biosphere. Without taking the underlying causes of viral zoonotic diseases into account, policy makers may end up implementing status-quo-perpetuating long-term fiscal measures that result in more, not less pandemics in the future. These could, in turn, increase the need for short-term biopolitical measures in the case of future viral outbreaks, compromising democratic societies if used repeatedly, or lead to a surveillance state if used continuously. With a Derridean term, post-pandemic fiscal measures based on old paradigm economics are auto-immune: they end up replicating the problem they initially set out to solve. corona; recession; biopower; biopolitics; autoimmunity; Derrida; heterodox economics; ecological economics; pandemic; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 Hasberg , K S 2020 , ' Macht\\/Nichtwissen in der Post-Corona-Rezession und die Autoimmunit\\u00e4t der Konjunkturpolitik [Power\\/ignorance in the Coronavirus recession and the autoimmunity of crisis mitigation measures].

The Covid-19 is still on the rise across the globe. As there is no treatment available for the SARS-Cov-2, it is important to mantain social distance, practice frequent hand-washing and use mask.

Its effects will be felt mostly by entrepreneurs from the category of small and medium-sized enterprises and sole proprietors. Small and medium-sized en-terprises are a pillar of the Slovak economy. The aim of the article is to point out the initial impacts of corona crisis on SMEs in the Slovak Republic and to propose me-asures to mitigate its negative consequences. We present that 8.9% of entrepreneurs out of all active small and medium-sized enterprises had to close their operations in a peri-od of extraordinary situation. Even the part of entrepreneurs who continued in their activities and have not closed operations (57%) has a big problem with the declining demand for their products and services.

The present study was undertaken to explore the association of Indigenous Knowledge System with quarantine and lockdown process emerged due to Covid- 19. For this present study, three tribes were selected from Tani tribal groups (Galo, Adi and Nyishi) of Arunachal Pradesh, who performed customary quarantine rituals. This study is based on secondary sources of data. It is noticed that their ritualistic quarantine beside small scale society, bonding and solidarity play a crucial role to fight with Corona. These tribal groups their revived traditional ritual practices and adopted self - resilience strategies to cope up with Corona pandemic.

In terms of purpose, is an applied research and in nature, is descriptive-correlation. The statistical population included all residents of Lorestan province in 1398 that had faced with effects of coronavirus epidemic. The sample based on Cochran formula was 384 men and women. Sampling was done by cluster sampling and questionnaires were completed by internet survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Mello & Worrell's (2007) time attitude, Paloutzian & Ellison's Spiritual Health (1983), and the researcher - constructed Aggression and Relationship quality Questionnaire were used to collect the data. Generalized anxiety had a positive effect on the level of aggression and a negative effect on the quality of relationship and positive attitude toward the future. Spiritual health mediated the adverse effects of pervasive anxiety on positive future attitudes and quality of relationship with the family, but didnt show mediating effect on aggression. Due to the mental threats of corona epidemic, the necessity of recognizing the mediating factors is clearly seen, and the findings of this study to confirm the mediating role of spiritual health provide a strategic tool for the country's psychologists and planners. The results of this study suggest that spiritual health can be used as a cornerstone in maintaining the health of individuals as a fundamental factor in moderating the effects of generalized anxiety due to the corona crisis. \\\"anxiety \\\" \\\"psychological outcomes\\\" \\\"corona epidemic \\\" \\\"spiritual health\\\"; Psychology; BF1-990 Fa\\u1e63ln\\u0101mah-i Farhang Mushavirah va Rav\\u0101n\\/Darm\\u0101n\\u012b, Vol 11, Iss 42, Pp 1-36 (2020) kamran sheivandi; fazlollah hasanvand\"},{\"id\":\"3fcdcd5d7b302447f57641386c5f3963d898a7b30068182e58df487e57058ac7\",\"content\":\"Designing the Shape of Corona Virus Using the PDE Method The aim of this study is designing the shape of corona virus (COVID-19) using the partial differential equation (PDE). The technique improvement was based on using an elliptic PDE as well as a set of four boundary conditions. The PDE method can generate surfaces of geometries from a small number of parameters. Also, the shape of the surfaces, which is generated by the PDE method, is based on a boundary representation and it can easily be changed since it is described by data distributed around the boundaries. In this study, the shape of the generated PDE-based representation of a corona virus has been sketched by using MATLAB program. The results showed that the PDE method is appropriate for representing the shape of a corona virus. Besides that, the data, concerning the radius and height from the corona virus, are then used to get four equations. These equations can be used for future prediction in modeling COVID-19. In conclusion, the PDE method can produce smooth parametric surface representations of any given shapes of viruses. The study involves that the PDE method has ability to generate surfaces of complex geometries. partial differential equation; parametric surface; geometric designing; periodic boundary conditions; Mathematics; QA1-939 General Letters in Mathematics , Vol 8, Iss 2, Pp 75-82 (2020) Jiyar Jafar Ahmed\"},{\"id\":\"b6961213d433ff83597fd84746d73f436f859fab63735dcd1421129bf35eb193\",\"content\":\"The Post-Corona World and International Political Landscape: Emerging Challenges The outbreak of the global pandemic and its global outreach has challenged and shocked the international community.

The corona mechanism in air is not exclusive to the field of energy applications but has also been widely studied by physicists to theorize mechanisms of charge transfer during the different phases of gas discharge. The phases of the discharge and its corresponding behavior with alternating voltage (AC) are well established and represented through various discharge trends, patterns and stages. This not only makes the identification of the PD defect possible but also helps evaluate the risk. This paper investigates corona configurations under DC stress in an attempt to create a similar outline of the defect as exists under AC. The defect is studied in terms of the pulse sequence information. The measurement system requirements are kept within a realistic realm to preserve applicability to industrial measurements.

Authorities first identified the virus in Wuhan, China. More than 82542 case of Corona virus in China at 31 March 2020. Health authorities have identified many other people with COVID-19 around the world. On 31 March 2020, the virus spread more than 750890 People in the World. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency relating to COVID-19. Since then, this strain has been diagnosed in several residents of world. The CDC have advised that it is likely to spread to more people. COVID-19 has affected at least 213 countries or territories or areas. The first people with COVID-19 had links to an animal and seafood market. This fact suggested that animals initially transmitted the virus to humans. However, people with a more recent diagnosis had no connections with or exposure to the market, confirming that humans can pass the virus to each other. Corona viruses will infect most people at some time during their lifetime. Corona viruses can mutate effectively, which makes them so contagious. Information on the virus is scarce at present. In the past, respiratory conditions that develop from corona viruses, such as SARS and MERS, have spread through close contacts. On 17 February 2020, the Director-General of the WHO presented at a media briefing the following updates on how often the symptoms of COVID-19.However, while some viruses are highly contagious, it is less clear how rapidly corona viruses will spread. Symptoms vary from person-to-person with COVID-19. It may produce few or no symptoms. However, it can also lead to severe illness and may be fatal. On 11 March 2020, WHO declaredNovel Corona virus Disease(COVID-19) outbreak as a Pandemic.

Our country imposed limited commuting to religious, recreational places and trading centers, closed schools and universities, decreased working hours, and cleaned crowded areas and passageways with disinfectants (subway stations, bus stations, and gas stations). Other efforts include: Establishing outposts in order to identify cases of Corona Virus at City entrances and Telephone screening through 4030\\\"that is a hotline for COVID-19 detection and providing relevant health information1.\\\" Despite the necessary precautions taken, there were problems in fighting the Corona Disease, the most important of which include: Insufficiency regarding personal protective equipment like masks, disinfectants and hospital gowns,3 Inadequate number of hospital beds and equipment in some of the cities and shortage of health workers. This issue has caused a high concern in the society and amongst the health workers who take care of Corona virus cases in hospitals. Also, due to the experienced mental disorders of the health care workers while COVID-19 outbreak,4 the role of such shortages in the fight against this disease is crucial. In a situation like this where the number of infected people shoots up, hygienic needs of Iran increases, too. A new trend in fighting the disease has begun. In this trend, different groups of people like clerics and cleric students, Basij, medical and non-medical students have taken measures in fighting the Corona Virus which are in line with the World health organization and Ministry of Health and Medical Education standards. These measures are taken in 4 general areas, including: 1. disinfecting the pssageways (Streets, Alleys), highly populated areas (Trading Centers, Bus and Subway stations, Gas stations) and vehicles, 2. producing personal protective equipment (Masks, face shields, gowns and disinfectants), 3. helping with the Telephone Screening by Medical students, and 4. Volunteer medical students participation in health care centers and hospitals. Now, despite the exigent circumstances regarding the spread of COVID-19 worldwide, volunteer measures and organized activities in Iran have led to provision of telephone screening information and details about the COVID-19 to more than 65 million people until March 31, 2020;5 and production of thousands of hygienic products daily has had a significant role in controlling and fighting the Corona Virus Pandemic. Although in the early period of the virus outbreak, Iran was the third country to have the most cases of Corona positive cases after China and Korea until 2nd of March, and the number of identified cases increased in April 15, 2020 which might be due to the efficient and comprehensive screening process, it became the 8th country with the most positive cases of Corona after the United States, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, England, and China.2 It is also expected that with adequate health equipment, specialized human resources and provision of scientific information to the community, the public and health workers who take care of Corona virus cases will have tranquility. Therefore, Iran\\u2019s approach towards facing the COVID-19 clearly states the fact that national approach in fighting the Corona Virus is an important factor among other measures taken and it is mentioned as a modern approach in managing a health crisis in a large scale. covid-19; iran; national approach; Medicine; R; Nursing; RT1-120 International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery, Vol 8, Iss 3, Pp 275-276 (2020) Tayebe Pourghaznein; Sina Salati\"},{\"id\":\"d0dc3fceb175672c875b575e97e5f44bf7a002938ede0d9739cd780cb02f7231\",\"content\":\"Criteria to evaluate the communities\\u2019 plan and action against the corona virus Abstract Talking about evaluation of countries and communities\\u2019 responses to corona virus needs specific criteria; some of them are discussed in this manuscript as below: 1-Population: Count and structure of population affect the outcome of COVID-19 management, the elder population are more prone to mortality and morbidity from corona virus. 2-The Economic, Political and Social structure of the country: Given the experience gained, this is probably the most effective component on the outcome of Corona pandemic. 3-Solidarity and integrated managerial system coupled with people-centered politics are another issues that should be taken into more consideration in any evaluation process. Communities such as China, eastern and south-eastern countries which received orders and executions from one source were more successful. At the same time, communities such as England and the United States have suffered partly due to their unintegrated domestic policy. Despite the delay, thanks to the presence of a unified leadership and coherent management as well as community participation, our country was among the successful communities. 4-Structure of Health Delivery System (HDS): Universal coverage is an indicator to evaluate HDS. The more public health coverage, the more successful would be the plan. Iran, Scandinavian communities and Southeast Asian countries with their good universal coverage were more successful than western countries. It is worth noting here that England is an exceptional country owing to its good universal coverage based on leveling of services, referral system; however, its success was affected by its economic and political status as well as financial payments index which has been mainly defined for medical services. 5-Health Facilities: Efficacy of this item was under controlled by national economic and political managerial system and universal health coverage at health delivery system. The United States, for example, reveals 2 to 3 times as many manpower and hospital beds and equipment as many eastern and western communities. However, the public suffered from COVID-19 due to the poor socio-economic structure. Conflicts in providing these facilities further tarnished the image of the West. Iran otherwise of US sanctions did a good job regarding producing health facilities and even could exporte them. 6- Knowledge responding to corona virus: The experience and knowledge of responding to COVID-19 were distributed fast all over the globe and used by health providers; however, MOLECULLAR CELULLAR and DIGITAL sciences made difference among the countries. All of the successful countries such as china, Singapore, south chorea, Nippon benefited from these sciences, to build up the diagnostic facilities and detection of affected cases and thus responding fast to them. Iran was somewhat successful in molecular-cellular science; however, showed weak and dependent in digital science demonstrating needs to work more seriously in these fields not only in responding corona crisis but as a developmental knowledge, which is hoped to be considered by policymakers and managers in the future.

Differentiation with histone-deacetylase inhibitor, vorinostat (SAHA), can induce stem cells to differentiate as well as enforces non-CSCs to reprogram to CSCs. To avoid this undesirable effect, one can block the Wnt-\\u03b2catenin pathway. Thus, a dual delivery system of SAHA and a Wnt-\\u03b2catenin blocker will be beneficial in the induction of differentiation of CSCs. Protein corona (PC) formation in nanoparticle has a biologic milieu, and despite all problematic properties, it can be employed as a medium for dual loading of the drugs.Materials and Methods: We prepared sphere gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with human plasma protein corona loaded with SAHA as differentiating agent and PKF118-310 (PKF) as a Wnt-\\u03b2catenin antagonist. The MCF7 breast cancer stem cells were treated with NPs and the viability and differentiation were evaluated by Western blotting and sphere formation assay.Results: We found that both drugs loaded onto corona-capped GNPs had significant cytotoxicity in comparison to bare GNP-corona. Data demonstrated an increase in stem cell population and upregulation of mesenchymal marker, Snail by SAHA-loaded GNPs treatment; however, the combination of PKF loaded GNPs along with SAHA-loaded GNPs resulted in a reduction of stem cell populations and Snail marker. We have shown that in MCF7 and its CSCs simultaneous treatment with SAHA and PKF118-310 induced differentiation and inhibition of Snail induction.Conclusion: Our study reveals the PC-coated GNPs as a biocompatible career for both hydrophilic (PKF) and hydrophobic (SAHA) agents which can decrease breast cancer stem cell populations along with reduced stemness state regression.Keywords: co-delivery, HDAC inhibitor, Wnt, cancer stem cell, protein corona co-delivery; hdac inhibitor; wnt; cancer stem cell; protein corona; Medicine (General); R5-920 International Journal of Nanomedicine, Vol Volume 15, Pp 4063-4078 (2020) Shamsian A; Sepand MR; Javaheri Kachousangi M; Dara T; Ostad SN; Atyabi F; Ghahremani MH\"}]"
