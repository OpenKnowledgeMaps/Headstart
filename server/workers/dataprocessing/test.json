Starting from the example of Google Scholar, the authors show that this well established service does not address the current needs, practices, and variety of discovery. Alternatives in terms of technical choices, features, and governance, do however exist, offering richer and more open discovery. The paper presents in particular the implementations and research work of the H2020 project TRIPLE (Transforming Research through Innovative Practices for Linked Interdisciplinary Exploration). Dedicated to the building of a discovery platform for the SSH, the project is meant to address the specificities and evolution of discovery in this field. Prevailing scholarly resource platforms like Google Scholar limit discovery by focussing only on publications, and favouring through their algorithm well-cited papers, English content, and discipline-specific resources. A limitation in the context of cross-disciplinary and collaborative Open Science, such a service more specifically hinders discovery in the SSH. Characterized by a fragmented landscape, a variety of languages, data types, and outputs, research in the SSH requires services that fully exploit discovery potentialities. Moreover, a survey conducted within the TRIPLE project showed that most SSH researchers use Google Scholar as their starting point, and that they recognise the lack of control they have with this system. Beyond the extension of features and content, transparency is the other important criterion for the building of an Open Infrastructure actually serving the research community. In light of this, we present in some detail the GoTriple platform, which exploits today\'s technological potential and incorporates the best known functionalities in order to unveil more and innovative scholarly outputs and lead to international and interdisciplinary research project collaborations.","year":"2022","published_in":null,"resulttype":"Journal article","subject":"Open Science; Content discovery; Information seeking; Social Sciences; Humanities; Infrastructure; Search engines; Multilingualism","url":"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.12688\\/openreseurope.14318.2","link":null,"oa_state":null,"citation_count":0.0,"cited_by_accounts_count":"1","cited_by_policies_count":null,"subtitle":null,"cited_by_msm_count":null,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":"1","cited_by_patents_count":null,"identifier":null,"relevance":null,"relation":null,"subject_orig":"Open Science; Content discovery; Information seeking; Social Sciences; Humanities; Infrastructure; Search engines; Multilingualism","type":null,"typenorm":null,"lang":null,"language":null,"content_provider":null,"coverage":null,"is_duplicate":null,"has_dataset":null,"sanitized_authors":null,"relations":null,"annotations":null,"repo":null,"source":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"page":null,"issn":null,"publication_year":2022.0},{"doi":"10.1371\\/journal.pcbi.1007704","id":"72222508","title":"Ten simple rules for innovative dissemination of research","authors":"Tony Ross-Hellauer; Russell Schwartz; Jonathan P.

Moreover, we study how open access and DOIs provided by Zenodo influence the impact of Zenodo data records and we find a tendency toward a positive relationship between permissive access rights and altmetrics in certain data records.","year":"2017","published_in":null,"resulttype":"Journal article","subject":"Zenodo; data citation; citation analysis; altmetrics; repository; bibliometrics; ; Information resources; Z","url":"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3389\\/frma.2017.00013","link":null,"oa_state":null,"citation_count":33.0,"cited_by_accounts_count":"44","cited_by_policies_count":null,"subtitle":null,"cited_by_msm_count":null,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":null,"cited_by_patents_count":null,"identifier":null,"relevance":null,"relation":null,"subject_orig":"Zenodo; data citation; citation analysis; altmetrics; repository; bibliometrics; Bibliography.

Invasion science is critical to mitigate invader impacts, yet due to the strong increase of data and information in this area, it has become difficult to acquire and maintain an overview of the field. As a result, existing evidence is often not found, knowledge is too rarely transferred to practice, and research is sometimes conducted in pursuit of dead ends. We propose to address these challenges by developing an interactive atlas of invasion science that can be2024-10-28T08:11:23.360776179Z  extended to other disciplines in the future. This online portal, which we aim to create in the course of the project described here, will be an evolving knowledge resource and open for anyone to use, including researchers, citizen scientists, practitioners and policy makers. Users will be able to zoom into the major research questions and hypotheses of invasion science, which are connected to the relevant studies published in the field and, if available, the underlying raw data. The portal will apply cutting-edge visualization techniques, artificial intelligence and novel methods for knowledge synthesis.","year":"2021-08-18","published_in":"NeoBiota","resulttype":"Journal article","subject":"hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach; hypothesis networks; interactive knowledge discovery; invasive alien species; invasion biology; Open Knowledge Maps; open science; Wikidata","url":"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.3897\\/neobiota.68.66685","link":null,"oa_state":null,"citation_count":14.0,"cited_by_accounts_count":"27","cited_by_policies_count":null,"subtitle":null,"cited_by_msm_count":null,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":"2","cited_by_patents_count":null,"identifier":null,"relevance":null,"relation":null,"subject_orig":"hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach; hypothesis networks; interactive knowledge discovery; invasive alien species; invasion biology; Open Knowledge Maps; open science; Wikidata","type":null,"typenorm":null,"lang":null,"language":null,"content_provider":null,"coverage":null,"is_duplicate":null,"has_dataset":null,"sanitized_authors":null,"relations":null,"annotations":null,"repo":null,"source":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"page":null,"issn":null,"publication_year":2021.0},{"doi":"10.5281\\/ZENODO.1065507","id":"47333359","title":"Zenodo Public Metadata Records Until 17 January 2017","authors":"Isabella Peters; Peter Kraker; Elisabeth Lex; Christian Gumpenberger; Juan Gorraiz","paper_abstract":"This dataset contains metadata of all publicly available records on Zenodo (n=142,117 data records), downloaded on 17 January 2017.

Observing the many shortcomings of discovery workflows in the course of Covid-19 confirms that discoverability itself is in crisis. We currently do not have the tools to get a quick overview of current research results and to be able to evaluate them correctly. In this event, we want to discuss this crisis, but also highlight various discovery approaches that have emerged in the course of the Covid-19 pandemic (or already before). In particular, we want to showcase the potential of open infrastructures for the development of innovative discovery solutions. The event will be divided into three sections: we will kick off with reports from researchers, librarians and practitioners on real-life discovery workflows in the Covid-19 pandemic and the problems associated with it.

When pertinent issues are not answered by a single research source, such as whether a drug is effective, data and images from multiple sources are compiled into a visual dashboard called a ReFigure. The collection is not meant to be exhaustive, but to offer a single reference point for definitive research in key areas of biomedical research. CoVis makes it easier to get started on coronavirus research - but also helps you to stay up-to-date. In order to do justice to the rapid development of COVID-19 research, the database is extended regularly by a dedicated team of curators. Subject-matter experts from around the world are invited to contribute to CoVis in a number of ways. They can provide feedback and propose research resources for inclusion in the map using a short form. They can join the curation or create their own ReFigures and interpretations of research findings for inclusion in the knowledge map.

For example, researchers often need to get an overview of a research field (e.g. at the beginning of their PhD, or later on when venturing in a neighbouring field) or a certain topic (e.g. when writing the state-of-the-art for a project proposal). Currently, there are only a limited number of discovery tools for scientific content that can be used by a mainstream audience. Most researchers still rely on scholarly search engines, which satisfy some information needs, but are a poor discovery tool. Search engines present resources in a linear, one-dimensional way, making it necessary to sift through every item in the list. They provide little context apart from basic metadata, which makes it hard to infer the topical structure of the content. Most scholarly search engines are also not suited to the new open science paradigm, in which not only the written results are published, but also data, source code, images etc., because they typically ignore non-publication resources like GenBank and other NCBI databases. Another problem is that the results of the discovery process are usually not shared; they become visible only later as references in a publication or reading lists, but again with very little context and structure. Therefore, the discovery process is repeated over and over again by different researchers, because it lacks the collaborative efficiencies that have become the norm in the open science environment and researchers\' time and resources are wasted. To overcome these problems with the traditional, closed discovery process, we propose BLAZE, the collaborative discovery tool for open science.","year":"2016","published_in":null,"resulttype":"Other","subject":"","url":"http:\\/\\/github.com\\/pkraker\\/open-discovery","link":null,"oa_state":null,"citation_count":null,"cited_by_accounts_count":null,"cited_by_policies_count":null,"subtitle":null,"cited_by_msm_count":null,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":null,"cited_by_patents_count":null,"identifier":null,"relevance":null,"relation":null,"subject_orig":null,"type":null,"typenorm":null,"lang":null,"language":null,"content_provider":null,"coverage":null,"is_duplicate":null,"has_dataset":null,"sanitized_authors":null,"relations":null,"annotations":null,"repo":null,"source":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"page":null,"issn":null,"publication_year":2016.0},{"doi":"10.5281\\/zenodo.5771602","id":"105054447","title":"Discoverability Use Cases to help define Requirements for Research Data Discovery Tools","authors":"Brigitte Mathiak; Navtej Juty; Alessia Bardi; Julien Colomb; Peter Kraker","paper_abstract":"In order to build a better ecosystem for data discovery tools, we collected use cases between 2019 and 2020 from a variety of sources.

An essay on the need for a new approach to scholarly discovery [version 2; peer review: 2 approved] This essay discusses the concept of discovery, intended as content discovery, and defines it in the new context of Open Science, with a focus on Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Starting from the example of Google Scholar, the authors show that this well established service does not address the current needs, practices, and variety of discovery. Alternatives in terms of technical choices, features, and governance, do however exist, offering richer and more open discovery. The paper presents in particular the implementations and research work of the H2020 project TRIPLE (Transforming Research through Innovative Practices for Linked Interdisciplinary Exploration). Dedicated to the building of a discovery platform for the SSH, the project is meant to address the specificities and evolution of discovery in this field. Prevailing scholarly resource platforms like Google Scholar limit discovery by focussing only on publications, and favouring through their algorithm well-cited papers, English content, and discipline-specific resources. A limitation in the context of cross-disciplinary and collaborative Open Science, such a service more specifically hinders discovery in the SSH. Characterized by a fragmented landscape, a variety of languages, data types, and outputs, research in the SSH requires services that fully exploit discovery potentialities. Moreover, a survey conducted within the TRIPLE project showed that most SSH researchers use Google Scholar as their starting point, and that they recognise the lack of control they have with this system. Beyond the extension of features and content, transparency is the other important criterion for the building of an Open Infrastructure actually serving the research community. In light of this, we present in some detail the GoTriple platform, which exploits today\'s technological potential and incorporates the best known functionalities in order to unveil more and innovative scholarly outputs and lead to international and interdisciplinary research project collaborations.

The event will be divided into three sections: we will kick off with reports from researchers, librarians and practitioners on real-life discovery workflows in the Covid-19 pandemic and the problems associated with it. Second, we will invite open infrastructures and open source toolmakers to present potential ...

But finding reliable research results is often difficult: with over 200,000 papers published on the topic, scientists spend a lot of valuable time reviewing the literature. <strong>CoVis is addressing this challenge: the tool provides a curated knowledge map of seminal works on COVID-19. <\\/strong>CoVis provides a quick overview of seminal research outputs from key areas of biomedical research. When pertinent issues are not answered by a single research source, such as whether a drug is effective, data and images from multiple sources are compiled into a visual dashboard called a ReFigure. The collection is not meant to be exhaustive, but to offer a single reference point for definitive research in key areas of biomedical research. CoVis makes it easier to get started on coronavirus research - but also helps you to stay up-to-date. In order to do justice to the rapid development of COVID-19 research, the database is extended regularly by a dedicated team of curators. Subject-matter experts from around the world are invited to contribute to CoVis in a number of ways. They can provide feedback and propose research resources for inclusion in the map using a short form. They can join the curation or create their own ReFigures and interpretations of research findings for inclusion in the knowledge map. Developed in collaboration between Open Knowledge Maps and ReFigure, CoVis establishes a meaningful link between the two infrastructures, combining powerful visual overview and knowledge synthesis components and offering them to stakeholders of COVID-19 research as an open infrastructure.

It is intended to give researchers that are new to a field a head start on their literature review (hence the name). Version 2.9 is an interim release on the way to Headstart 3. A major architectural upgrade is that the visualization components have been decoupled with the help of the mediator pattern. We have also implemented many improvements to the visualization interface, such as search highlighting and support for multiple languages. The PLOS search has been extentded to include a number of options, and more descriptive labels for research areas using a TF-IDF labelling algorithm.

For example, researchers often need to get an overview of a research field (e.g. at the beginning of their PhD, or later on when venturing in a neighbouring field) or a certain topic (e.g. when writing the state-of-the-art for a project proposal). Currently, there are only a limited number of discovery tools for scientific content that can be used by a mainstream audience. Most researchers still rely on scholarly search engines, which satisfy some information needs, but are a poor discovery tool. Search engines present resources in a linear, one-dimensional way, making it necessary to sift through every item in the list. They provide little context apart from basic metadata, which makes it hard to infer the topical structure of the content. Most scholarly search engines are also not suited to the new open science paradigm, in which not only the written results are published, but also data, source code, images etc., because they typically ignore non-publication resources like GenBank and other NCBI databases. Another problem is that the results of the discovery process are usually not shared; they become visible only later as references in a publication or reading lists, but again with very little context and structure. Therefore, the discovery process is repeated over and over again by different researchers, because it lacks the collaborative efficiencies that have become the norm in the open science environment and researchers\' time and resources are wasted. To overcome these problems with the traditional, closed discovery process, we propose BLAZE, the collaborative discovery tool for open science.
