It is an array of 96 mesocosm tanks, each containing ~1000 liters of water.  Water and organisms (excluding fish) are piped to LEAP directly from a Lake Hertel over a kilometer away. Lake Hertel is a protected lake not exposed to contaminants. The plumbing at LEAP allows for a semi-continuous flow of lake water and organisms into and out of the tanks throughout the season. These communities are natural analogues of the freshwater ponds and lakes so common in Canadian landscapes. The onsite lab allows us to rapidly process samples (see images below). An outflow reservoir can hold the outflow from all mesocosms so that decontamination can be done, if needed.

 Lippenbroek Experimental Wetland is a freshwater CRT (controlled reduced tide) in natura tidal facility, surface 8 ha, formerly used as cropland. Vegetation has been progressively replaced by flood-tolerant species (e.g. Lythrum salicaria, Lycopus europaeus, Salix sp., Typha angustifolia and Phragmites australis). Reconstruction of spring-neap tide flooding variation required the construction of separate inlet and outlet culvert.
 Lippenbroek Experimental Wetland is currently well equipped to study water and sediment balances. ADCP discharge sensors and automated sampling equipment at in- and outlet culverts allows for the detailed measurement of in- and outgoing water fluxes and quantification of the water and sediment balance. Ten sampling sites are installed with sediment elevation tables and piezometers. The flexible dimensions of the culverts allow the manipulation of the volume of incoming and outgoing tidal waters and hence manipulate tidal height, inundation frequency and inundation duration.
","Inundation frequency, vegetation, soil nutrients
","Lippenbroek Experimental Wetland is currently the only facility that allows in situ manipulation of various tidal characteristics in such detail and large scale. Multiple sampling sites across the area have been identified, with different elevations, allowing to assess at the sampling spot scale (12 m2) the effect of different flooding frequencies and duration, due to the differences in elevation.

 The future upgrades include 16 flexible gas exchange measurement setups (CO2, N2O, CH4) fluxes, allowing, a whole ecosystem tower for eddy covariance fluxes of CO2, H2O and CH4, permanent water quaity setups for all major nutrients that can be flexibly deployed, and upgrade of the facilities for flow measurement.

",since 2019,"The Bermuda Marine Mesocosm Facility (BMMF) is a robust and versatile state-of-the-art outdoor facility for experimental work and organism culturing.
The BMMF provides scientists with an opportunity to conduct research in controlled marine environments under near-natural conditions, meaning natural sun light and seawater that is pumped from the close-by Reach. It has twelve 500-L and four 1500-L experimental basins that can be run simultaneously and are designed with the potential to manipulate a range of environmental factors, such as temperature, light, CO2 concentrations, flow rate, and nutrients. The BMMF provides for a replicated and robust experimental design that is ideal for research on a variety of topics, including, for example, organism eco-physiology and reproduction, biological recovery and ecosystem resilience.

 Limnotrons, outdoor enclosure facility, 36 experimental ponds
 
The limnotrons are 9 stainless steel indoor mesocosms with a high level of control. The dimensions of these vessels are: 0.97 m in diameter, a depth between 1.32 m (side) and 1.37 m (centre), and a volume of 922 L. The vessels can be closed with a removable PMMA flange lid. In addition to the possibility to sample vertically with specifically designed integrated water samples, sampling can also be done by using the sampling ports positioned on three depths. If needed, mixing of the water column can take place by an impeller made of
PMMA, with a stainless steel axis, and a silicon rubber strip between the outside and the Limnotron wall to prevent wall growth. To create a different type of mixing more tailored to growth of cyanobacterial scums, oscillating grids have been designed. Originally designed to study pelagic communities, the Limnotrons have been adapted to allow for a benthic community as well. At present, each Limnotron can have a sediment layer of 10-15 cm, and with the recently purchased high intensity lights, a macrophyte community can be established in these mesocosms.
A unique feature of the limnotrons is the temperature regulation with separate upper and lower temperature blocks to allow for thermal stratification. A thermostatically regulated microprocessor-controlled cooling and heating installation controls the temperature of each of the vessels individually at 0.1 oC SE. The temperature program allows for running complicated temperature scenarios, including episodic events. Temperature is logged every minute.  Because of possible volume differences due to temperature settings, evaporation losses and sampling, a (refillable) expansion vessel was developed, which maintains a constant water volume in the experimental vessel. In addition, CO2 levels can be manipulated as well, by providing different CO2 /air mixtures with a WITT KM60-2ME gas mixer.
","Temperature, Light, Mixing regime, CO2
","The Limnotrons can be used to test the effect of warming, eutrophication and CO2 elevation on carbon cycling, stoichiometry of different trophic groups, nutrient balances, metabolism, adaptation and microevolution and community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, macrofauna, periphyton and macrophytes.

 1) The Experimental Lake Platform consists of 16 artificial lakes (30 m x 15 m x 3 m deep, 800 m3each) conceived for incorporating the natural complexity of the environment and the spatially heterogeneous nature of ecological processes in natural ecosystems. These large experimental systems are spatially structured, with shallow littoral areas, a central pelagic zone and a central benthic area, and may be interconnected by groups of 4 lakes through 10 m long dispersal channels. The artificial lakes will be equipped in Autumn 2014 with automated sensors and data loggers.
 The two other artificial reservoirs (126 m x 15 m x 3 m deep, 4000 m3) are a stocking lake (south) used to homogenize water before distribution to experimental lakes or mesocosms and a drainage lake (north) that can collect and purify used water at the end of experiments.
 2) A large number of mesocosms, from a few hundreds of liters to a few tens of m3, high degree of replication; Floating mesocosms installed on the stocking lake; more than 60 tanks installed outdoors and equipped with devices for the experimental control of thermal gradients and water mixing;  beaters that generate waves, control of the physical structure of the water column.
 3) Microcosms from one to several litres of volume for continuous cultures experiments; climatic chambers of the Ecotron IleDeFrance (precise conditioning of the environment and the detailed monitoring of states and activities of organisms and ecosystems) to study marine or freshwater ecosystems (plankton, benthos, macrophytes) under highly controlled environmental conditions.  A series of dedicated sensors enables monitoring of gas exchange (O2 and CO2) between the air and the water in the experimental system.

",40,"The Aquatic Research Facility at the KU Field Station provides a physical platform for a broad range of field‐based research. Experimental ponds and tanks (mesocosms) function as surrogates of the natural environment and permit replication of treatments and controls. They allow rigorous tests of ecological relationships, which otherwise can be difficult to identify in natural settings. 
Outdoor facilities: The Aquatic Research Facility was developed in stages over a 40-year period.  It now is one of the largest aquatic research facilities in the U.S. and is used to address both basic and applied research questions.
Major components of the Aquatic Research Facility infrastructure include 100 experimental ponds ranging in size from 0.01 to 0.8 hectares; 77 ponds are 0.045 hectares, and 10 are 0.01 hectares. These ponds are filled/drained from the bottom, which allows ponds to function as experimental wetlands or lentic systems. 
In addition, the facility has 80 large, 11‐cubic‐meter fiberglass tanks and a variety of enclosures that can be used for in situ experiments in any of the ponds. Experimental short flow through streams can also be constructed and used on site. 
On a larger scale, Cross Reservoir (Surface area 3 hectares, 12 meters deep, 50-hectare watershed) serves as a model of small Midwestern reservoirs. Details on the biotic and abiotic conditions in Cross can be found in deNoyelles et al. 2016.
Experimental aquatic systems such as these effectively simulate lakes and reservoirs in central North America. Small ponds are a critical link between aquatic and terrestrial habitats because they often are the first type of aquatic habitat to receive nonpoint source pollutants. 
Indoor facilities: A 325-square-meter greenhouse/mesocosm building, constructed in 2013, provides modern climate‐ controlled space that facilitates year‐round aquatic studies. A freestanding 110-square-meter aquatic research laboratory provides a space for sample preparation and analyses and is equipped with a flow-through water supply from the pond infrastructure. In addition, the Armitage Education Center has adjacent wet and dry laboratory facilities, a full kitchen, showers, laundry, classroom, and meeting space to accommodate up to 55 people. Two sleeping cabins are available to researchers for longer overnight stays.
","Our outdoor and indoor facilities allow a multitude of parameters to be manipulated or controlled at varying scales. Water used in experiments is discarded to a series of catchment reservoirs on-site. Catchment reservoirs have long residence times, which allows for degradation of herbicides/pesticides/pharmaceuticals with relatively short half-lives. 
Additionally, power is available at many of the ponds, allowing researchers to run large equipment within ponds/tanks for long time scales if needed.
","Research topics have included:

Cyanobacteria blooms and associated cyanotoxins
Effects of herbicides, pesticides, and pharmaceutical products on algal, zooplankton, and fish communites
Algal biofuels
Environmental DNA fate and transport
Ecological and biological stoichiometry 
Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCM) and algal migration
Persistent pollutant degradation rates and processes
Emergent insects
Endangered species
Fish competition and predation 
Trophic cascades/complex interactions

",,"Equipment housed at the field station—tractors, mowers, loaders, water haulers, off-road vehicles, fire rigs (in case researchers wish to examine the response of aquatic systems to specific terrestrial/watershed fire regimes)—is used to implement and maintain research projects.

","1982 - present (large flume, semi-natural stream); 2009 - present (tidal aquaria,, outdoor large basin)","St Pée facilities offer the opportunity to work with various sizes of artificial flowing-water mesocosms.
The Lapitxuri semi-natural stream (15 km from the INRA St Pée Institute) is fed by a diversion of a natural headwater stream. It is separated into 13 consecutive reaches (10m x 2.8m) allowing it to work with pseudo-replicates (each reach can be closed by downstream traps). T). Direct underwater observations can be performed on two reaches from an underground room. More classical mesocosms are available: 16 swedish tanks (2.5 m3), 8 circular tanks (0.1 m3), 6 indoor flumes (4.5 m long), 8 outdoor flumes (11m x 0.5m).
At the INRA St Pée Institute, a large 25 m3 circular flume (fluvarium) consists in 2 longitudinal sections (10 m x 1 m) separated by upstream and downstream traps. Water velocity (controlled by a propeller), light (twilight period possible), temperature (air+water), substratum and depth can be controlled.
Two smaller circular devices (tidal aquaria) consist of a 400 L aquarium where flow direction changes alternatively. They are located in two similar rooms, where air and water temperature, as well as light are controlled. It is used to investigate swimming behavior in tidal zone under different conditions or as replicates.
An outdoor large basin (756 m²) can be used under lentic (maximum depth: 4 m) or lotic (maximum depth: 80 cm) experimental situations. More classical mesocosms are available: 4 swedish tanks (2.5 m3), 2 series of 8 circular tanks (0. 16 or 0.5 m3), 1 series of 16 tanks (0.1 m3), 6 indoor flumes (1.50 m long).

","The LIFE Infrastructure is dedicated to the study of changes in freshwater ecosystems biodiversity with a primary interest in fish evolution and population dynamics. In this context, we also manipulate invertebrates, plants, mollusc, phyto and zooplankton. Major strengths of LIFE are its numerous facilities, the high expertise of its technical staff, and the possibility to perform experiments across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The main objective of  RI LIFE is to decipher the effects of multiple environmental forcings on individuals, populations or communities in order to inform management decisions for fish populations.

The Lapitxuri semi-natural stream (15 km from the INRA St Pée Institute) is fed by a diversion of a natural headwater stream. It is separated into 13 consecutive reaches (10m x 2.8m) allowing it to work with pseudo-replicates (each reach can be closed by downstream traps). T). Direct underwater observations can be performed on two reaches from an underground room. More classical mesocosms are available: 16 swedish tanks (2.5 m3), 8 circular tanks (0.1 m3), 6 indoor flumes (4.5 m long), 8 outdoor flumes (11m x 0.5m).
At the INRA St Pée Institute, a large 25 m3 circular flume (fluvarium) consists in 2 longitudinal sections (10 m x 1 m) separated by upstream and downstream traps. Water velocity (controlled by a propeller), light (twilight period possible), temperature (air+water), substratum and depth can be controlled.
Two smaller circular devices (tidal aquaria) consist of a 400 L aquarium where flow direction changes alternatively. They are located in two similar rooms, where air and water temperature, as well as light are controlled. It is used to investigate swimming behavior in tidal zone under different conditions or as replicates.
An outdoor large basin (756 m²) can be used under lentic (maximum depth: 4 m) or lotic (maximum depth: 80 cm) experimental situations. More classical mesocosms are available: 4 swedish tanks (2.5 m3), 2 series of 8 circular tanks (0. 16 or 0.5 m3), 1 series of 16 tanks (0.1 m3), 6 indoor flumes (1.50 m long).

",2017 - present,"1) AQUATIC MESOCOSMS
Our facility includes 30 outdoor polyethylene in-ground mesocosms (14 m3 operating volume each) nested within larger containment tanks. 
Each mesocosm is approximately 1.5 m deep and 3.6 m in diameter.  Overflow protection is provided by drainage into below-ground holding tanks.  The mesocosms are allowed to freeze each winter, resulting in ~ 0.5 m of liquid water maintained under ~ 1.0 m of snow and ice.  The water layer allows a range of taxa to persist across consecutive years, enabling multi-year studies.
A network of gravel roads allows large vehicles to access the mesocosms.  Wooden walkways and vertical posts support the staging and deployment of instrumentation, sampling materials, and other gear.
Evaporative losses are offset by potable water stored in a pair of large (25 m3) above-ground tanks and distributed to each mesocosm via a network of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) hoses.
Wastewater storage is provided by a series of above-ground tanks housed within a geomembrane-lined berm.  These tanks allow the storage of up to 125 m3 of wastewater from spring to early fall.
Emergent and submerged plants are propagated in shallow and deep artificial ponds respectively.  Biologically active water can be obtained via pipeline from a nearby pond or trucked in from an alternate source.
 
2) AQUATIC /TERRESTRIAL MESOCOSMS
InnoTech’s Above Ground Mesocosm Facility was constructed in collaboration with the Helmholtz-Alberta Initiative through the University of Alberta.  The facility consists of a geomembrane-lined and bermed containment pad (12 m x 28 m).  Currently, the facility includes 16 above ground mesocosms (5 m3, 1.32 m tall, 2.2 m diameter) capable of housing short to medium-term terrestrial or aquatic experiments, as well as 32 smaller (0.37 m3, 1.28 m tall, 0.6 m diameter) tanks that can be used for smaller-scale studies, or in conjunction with the larger tanks (see below). 
The mesocosms can be adapted for many different experimental conditions or to measure a range of parameters.  For example, past studies have included the forced aeration of the water column as a treatment condition, deployment of automated CO2 flux chambers on floating rafts, and the installation of a range of data loggers.
When empty, the tanks can be tipped on their side and rolled from place to place by a single person.  This allows the easy rearrangement of tanks to suit the needs of each study, and additional tanks can be added, depending on spacing and size of each tank.
The mesocosms are housed inside a geomembrane-lined containment berm which slopes towards a catchment basin.  In the event of a leak, materials will flow downhill to the catchment basin where they can be analyzed, then collected and disposed of appropriately.
A total of nine 2-inch access ports are installed at the top, middle, and bottom of each mesocosm tank (3 at each level).  These ports allow the installation of sensors and/or hoses.  If the mesocosms contain soil, hoses can be connected to corresponding ports on a pair of smaller (0.37 m3) tanks.  Hydraulic head will alter water level in the mesocosm by adding or removing water from these smaller tanks.  Alternatively, multiple mesocosms can be connected by hoses, allowing water to flow from one mesocosm to another.  Such a feature facilitates water homogenization across the entire array, or may be useful in studying multi-stage water treatment wetlands.
The facility is accessible to large vehicles including trucks and heavy equipment.  Biologically active water can be obtained via pipeline from a nearby pond or trucked in from an alternate source.
 
 
Support services.  Scientific and logistical support services (e.g., analytical chemistry, molecular biology, plant sciences, heavy equipment, and fabrication services) are available within 200 m of the facility.

To prevent thermal stratification, purpose-built mixers suspended in the middle of the mesocosm, can be moved slowly up and down through the water column. The mixers are controlled by data loggers and can be operated on different mixing regimes. All mesocosms are equipped with automatic sensors measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) every 5 minutes.

","Along the Yangtze River, hundreds of shallow lakes are over-exploited by human beings, resulting in the deterioration of the functions and services performed by these lake ecosystems. Furthermore, these shallow lakes are suffering from global climate change, under continuous warming over the last few decades and an unpredicted pattern of extreme climate events. We are interested in how climate change will affect these shallow lakes in the future, and what we can do to mitigate these effects.

",2012 - present,"A floating platform contains 8 arrays of 4 rings of a ~1 m diameter (i.e., maximal capacity = 32 mesocosms), which can be used to suspend polyethylene bags in the lake. Lake mesocosms can vary in depth, with the maximal lake depth at this location being ~7 m. Electrical wires are fed underneath the platform, with one electrical outlet providing a limited amount of power for each pair of rings. Gas tubing has also been fed under the platform. The floating dock is connected to the shore via a floating walkway.
The lake mesocosm platform is located in Lac Hertel at the Gault Nature Reserve. The watershed is fully forested and the surrounding park is owned by the University. However, the mesocosm platform is located within a part of the park that is off-limits to visitors. The access to the platform itself is protected via a fence, and there is a security camera.
A car or truck can reach 100 m away from the mesocosm platform. However, a golf cart, wagon or canoe can be borrowed to bring equipment to the platform.

Outdoor- pelagic – marine, brackish, (freshwater), 24 tanks of 1 m3. Sediment may be added.
The facility is located close to the seashore in the northern part of the Baltic Sea. The water outside of the field station is ice covered for 3-5 months a year, and brackish with a salinity around 3 PSU.
The water intake to the indoor mesocosms is situated 800 m off-shore at 2 and 8 meter depths. The mesocosms can also be filled with sea, lake or river water transported from elsewhere. Filling can be done through filters of selectable mesh sizes, down to 1 μm, an semi-automatic water renewal system with controllable turnover rate are also available. The indoor facility consists of 12 cylindrical mesocosms with water columns 4.86 m high and 0.73 m in diameter (volume ca. 2 m3). Temperature can be controlled and manipulated in 3 different sections of each mesocosm. This enables for projects that require stratification, controlled convective stirring or both.
The light sources are Valoya R-258 (Light DNA), especially produced with the aim to closely mimic the spectra of the sun. These lamps are handled by time-programs that controls spectra and intensity according to lattitude and time of day.  
Four freezers are installed on top of every three mesocosms, this enables control of the air temperature above the water columns down to -20o C. Projects that require ice can thus be carried out, and parameters such as freezing or thawing rate can be adjusted. This latter option allows for systematic seeding experiments.
The ventilation of the mesocosm hall is controlled by the CO2 content in the room, allowing for natural controls in experiments where the CO2 content in the water is altered.
The outdoor facility is available during summer. It consists of 4 large pools, each carrying 6 cubic mesocosms of 1 m3. The temperature is kept the same as in the water intake by using high rates of water flow through in the pools. Experimental designs can be supported by long-term ecological research time series of variables stored in an easily accessible database on the internet. About 70 international researchers have used the mesocosm facility during numerous experiments conducted over the past 10 years. Outcomes include two publications in top-ranked scientific journals regarding methylmercury levels in coastal environments.

",2023 - present,"The flumes system is fed with water coming directly from the Po river. By exploiting a natural pool and using a small barrier to regulate the water stage, water is made to flow into a pipeline connected to the flumes. The pipeline intake (diameter is 0.80 m) is placed close to the pool bottom; a metallic net protects the intake from coarse debris load, preventing the occlusion of the pipeline. Moreover, the rate of incoming water from the river can be regulated thanks to the presence of a sluice gate in front of the intake.
A 155 m long pipeline conveys flow from the intake to a loading tank, that acts as a dissipation reservoir and slows down the incoming flow. This main tank is connected to other three loading sub-tanks by means of three sluice gates, that can be completely opened (during the experiments), closed (for maintenance and cleaning) or partially closed (to regulate the flume flows). Each sub-tank feeds two channels, for a total of six flumes. Each flume is 25m long, 0.30m wide, 0.30m high and rectilinear. Each channel is made of a series of sub-channel units, connected together by screws. Some of these units have a widening (0.90m width) in the longitudinal direction which can be put in communication (by two sluice gates) with the main channel 0.3 m wide. In this way, these units can be used to simulate a pool habitat. Each flume bed is filled with natural substrate (i.e. boulders, cobbles and gravel) in a proportion which simulates the natural conditions characterizing the Po river in this stretch. Each couple of channels drain into a terminal tank. In total, three terminal tanks are connected together and convey water into a unique concrete shaft, connected to a pipeline that returns water to the river. If necessary, in two flumes  water can re-circulate by means of a pump which returns water into the upstream  sub-tank. Thus, these two channels can act as a closed-system.

","Manipulative experiments will be carried out in order to analyze changes in benthic communities (i.e. diatoms and macroinvertebrate), induced by environmental and/or chemical impacts. Concerning primary producers, we are interested in analyzing possible changes in benthic chlorophyll a of the main autotrophic organisms colonizing periphyton (namely diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae) and their proportions. Diatoms will also be analyzed at community level, focusing on both taxonomic and functional composition.
Macroinvertebrates will be analyzed at community level, focusing on taxonomic and functional composition. Main interests are related to eco-hydraulic impacts on benthic communities, especially in the frame of the current climatic scenario. We are also planning to perform life-cycle studies focused on selected aquatic insect taxa.
The flumes can be also utilized to perform ecological, behavioral and life-cycle studies concerning selected rheophilous and orophilous fish (such as Bullheads, Minnows et al.)
Flumes will be used to study the role of fluid dynamical characteristics of streams on benthic communities. From the basic features (e.g., water stage and bulk velocity) to more refined ones, like flow field and detachment zones close to sediments surface or the presence of bedforms (dunes, antidunes, ripples) and single obstacles. Moreover, the hydrodynamic impact of (totally or partially submerged) vegetation can be studied, as well as the influence of unsteady flows and surface waves.

",2009 to present.,"Outdoor freshwater static mesocosm systems.
We have 99 flat bottomed and 100 unique sloped mesocosms which are designed to simulate edge of field environments. Our sloped mesocosms were installed in 2013, are 2.6 m long, 1 m wide and 0.7 m deep and are used for herbicide studies. The sloped mesocosms are designed to enable the incorporation of a wide variety of plant species, providing a habitat which mimics the plant community found in edge of field environments. Our flat bottomed mesocosms were installed in 2009, are 1.8 m long, 0.9 m wide and 0.8 m deep and are predominantly used in pesticide studies.
Indoor laboratories.
We have a GLP laboratory facility in which we can carry out higher tier chronic testing on multiple and single species under controlled conditions.
","
Outdoor mesocosms: Plant community, water depth, test item present, initial organism establishment
Indoor laboratories: Environmental parameters (including temperature, pH,  oxygen and light/dark cycles), species present, sediment/substrates, feeding regimes

","At CEA we produce robust population and community endpoints (ETO RAC and ERO RAC) that meet the requirements of the EFSA (2013) aquatic guidance. We conduct mesocosm studies on both herbicide and pesticide products and can carry out the application of our test item in several ways (e.g. mix-in, spray-over) and perform single or multiple applications as required.

","Module I fully functional, Module II (Drie Eiken Flume) epected in 2019","The mesocosm facility at Drie Eiken (figure 1) consists of two modules. Module I holds 16 cylindrical ponds 2 m wide on 1.2 m deep (water depth), module II is equipped with 4 oblong raceways, each 2 x 5 m long (the water circulates around a mid-section) and 80 cm deep (water depth). The raceways are temperature controlled and allow accurate flow control. They are equipped with windows for easy monitoring of organismal behavior and/or plant stature. Module II also houses the larger flume facility (black box in figure 2, see also § 3.2 Flume facility Drie Eiken). Additionally module II holds aquaculture infrastructure for fish stocking. Both modules are integrated in a 1000 m² greenhouse. In module I the roof can be completely opened as to expose the ponds to the elements, whenever necessary in the experimental setup, module II has a classical greenhouse setup. The latter module also integrates a small wet lab facility for basic lab work, e.g. dissections, determinations, microscopy, weighing, etc.

","Ecological research:

What’s the relationship between intermittency temporal extent on stream ecosystem processes?
Will warmer nights cause a shift towards heterotrophy?
How relevant are heatwaves in shaping stream communities?
Does intermittency influence the length of trophic invertebrate chains?

Ecotoxicological research:

What’s the interaction between physical stressors such as water stress during droughts and chemical stress by pharmaceuticals?
Does biodegradation of pharmaceuticals depend on temperature?
Is bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in biofilms and inverts depend solely on exposure?

 The Aquatron is well suited to accommodate almost any lab-based aquatic experiment. It boasts six large tanks holding a combined volume of over 2,000 m3, as well as a wide variety of smaller tanks, research spaces and equipment.
 Pool Tank:
 Diameter: 15.24 m
 Depth: 3.54 m perimeter to 3.91 m center (11’7½” to 12’10”)
 Volume: 684,050 litres (150, 477 gallons)
 The tank is made from reinforced concrete, with a glass reinforced polyester liner sealed with an epoxy coating. The tank itself sits atop a concrete tank stand with neoprene blocks sandwiched in between to partially acoustically uncouple the tank.
 The main deck is located at the top of the tank allowing access to all points of the tank surface. In addition to the main tank, there is an adjoining satellite tank and three associated rooms. The small isolation pool is connected to the main tank via a tunnel, which is 0.96 m wide, 1.12 m deep and 2.74 m long. The tunnel can be divided with drop gates at either end.
 The satellite tank is 1.12 m deep, and approximately 1.8 m in diameter. Of the rooms, the first is a viewing room with a large glass window allowing a complete view of the tank surface. The second room is a large wet lab with flowing seawater and freshwater. The third room is located just above the tank and serves as a base of operations for the tank users.
 Twenty-two underwater glass viewing ports, approximately 1m2 in size, are located around the perimeter of the tank. Windows are located at various depths to allow viewing at all levels of the tank. The windows are accessed through a viewing deck located below the main deck.
 Tower Tank:
 Diameter: 3.66 m (34’4”)
 Depth: 10.46 m (12’)
 Volume: 117,100 litres (25,750 gallons)
 The tank is constructed of reinforced concrete and is lined with a glass reinforced polyester liner sealed with an epoxy coating. The tank is separated from the building via neoprene blocks, which are sandwiched between the tank and the tank stand.
 The tank can be divided into three layers of water with each layer having different physical parameters. Water sampling can be performed through the sampling ports arranged throughout the wall of the tank. The tank is also equipped with a series of viewing ports (25 of which are suitable for human observation or for use with video equipment).
 The tank is completely insulated with insulated window port covers to minimize sweating and condensation. Without the insulation, water would rain down into the building basement causing flooding.
 The Tower Tank spans four floors in the Oceanography Tower of the Life Sciences Building. The top of the tank rises just above the fourth floor with the bottom ending just about even with the first floor. The Tower Tank has three associated lab platforms that function primarily as locations for data collection equipment. These lab platforms are located on the first, third and fourth floor levels. Access to the tank can be through each of the lab platforms. Access to the main drain on the bottom of the tank is through the basement, below the first floor.
