",2016 - present,"LEAP is based at McGill University’s Gault Reserve It is a facility designed for well-replicated experiments addressing the evolution and ecology of aquatic ecosystems exposed to environmental stressors. It is an array of 96 mesocosm tanks, each containing ~1000 liters of water.  Water and organisms (excluding fish) are piped to LEAP directly from a Lake Hertel over a kilometer away. Lake Hertel is a protected lake not exposed to contaminants. The plumbing at LEAP allows for a semi-continuous flow of lake water and organisms into and out of the tanks throughout the season. These communities are natural analogues of the freshwater ponds and lakes so common in Canadian landscapes. The onsite lab allows us to rapidly process samples (see images below). An outflow reservoir can hold the outflow from all mesocosms so that decontamination can be done, if needed.
